So many people ask, is this gear good enough? Well that's the wrong question. Good enough sucks. And if you're like me, you're always looking for the next shiny gadget to solve some creative pain point and you need the best. Well today I have a highly curated list of 12 gear items that I fell in love with this year and I thought it'd be fun to share with you how they made a difference in my life and since they helped me, maybe they could help you too. Some of this stuff is on sale right now but I warn you, please do not buy anything just because it's on sale, only buy because it makes sense for your needs. Item one of my list is going to be the TP-Link Casa Smart Plug for Apple Home Kit. That's this guy right here. Very very simple item. All it does is it plugs into the wall but it solves the problem of how do you turn on and on stuff that doesn't have an on off switch. There's some items that we end up with like I've got the Blackmagic ATEM Mini Pro ISO or the DaVinci Resolve Mini Color Panel. Those don't have on off switches so how do we turn them off? Instead of going to unplug them when I need to, I can just simply click a button in the Apple Home app. Example, right now I'll turn off the corner bulb in the back of my room there or you could use your iPhone or you could use the Algato Stream Deck. It's really easy to integrate these into the Stream Deck without any special programming knowledge or anything. In fact, I'll leave a tutorial on how I learned how to set up quick actions and shortcuts so you can program your TP-Link CASA Smart Plug to your Stream Deck and get all kinds of great functionality for yourself. Next on the list that I really love is the Calbright 1, 2, 3 Colorimeter. The problem that this little colorimeter solves is it helps me calibrate my monitor's brightness to a standard like SRGB at 100 nits, 120 nits. Why is that important? Well, most monitors now are set super super bright, like way brighter than they should be. So if you work that way, export it, it's going to be super dark on some other display. So this at least gets you in the right ballpark. It's not super expensive. It'll work for up to two computer monitors and it has the software built in. So this is a really great way to get started with color calibration if that matters to you. So it's the Calbright 1, 2, 3 Colorimeter. Item 3 on the list is actually too big for me to hold. That's the Huanoh Ultra Wide Monitor arm for max 40 inch screen. So you can see I'm moving this around. It's on an arm. In fact, you want to see it a little bit better. This is my main computer screen that I would normally have right in front of me when I'm compositing or editing here for my freelance work. And what's great about this is obviously it's easy to get out of the way, but it also is going to save you desk space for other items you have on your desk. Maybe it's notes, maybe it's just other electronics, whatever it is. Or if you have your window shades open, you get some sun glare, you can easily take one of these that's on an arm and just slightly angle it to get rid of that glare on your screen. Really really nice. And the thing is with monitor arms, there's a ton of them out there. I've tried quite a few of them. These ones are actually strong enough to hold any display that I've put on them. Next up is the Wacom Intuos Pro drawing tablet. Now there's several of these out there. I don't really care that you get the Wacom one, but if you ever have the problem that you're working with your mouse, maybe you're doing some visual effects and you get that feeling in that part of your wrist, you're actually causing a lot of pain because you're in an unnatural position. It's not necessarily ergonomic, you're not getting the blood flow. Using a stylus is going to alleviate that for those long working hours. But beyond that, and the reason I actually have stuck with this for so, so long, is because I get speed and precision with this that you just can't get with the mouse because it's pressure sensitive. So that means if I dab down on my canvas and my fusion composition, I can allay the certain amount of transparency of paint that I want to, which I just can't do that with the mouse, right? There's not really a way to do that. As well as just, you can easily zoom into pixels without doing anything else, but just having your hands on here, it makes me feel like an artist. Now I'll tell you how do I set mine up, people ask me that all the time. The bottom of the stylus, now it's good to get a stylus that has two buttons, which the Intuos Pro does, but the bottom button is going to be set to the middle mouse click, which lets you zoom around really quickly. The top button will be set to the right click, so that's your contextual menus. As well as one other thing I'll say, if you use multiple computer displays, I actually set one of the buttons up here to just be mapped to the one computer's display. So instead of having one monitor here, one monitor here, this is just the one main monitor that I'm working with. And then if I go to the edge, I can't actually get to the other monitor. That's why I do have a mouse on my desk as well. Love the Wacom. I'll probably talk about this till I die, but I highly recommend you check it out. And when you first get one, chuck your mouse aside for at least a week because it does take time for that new muscle memory to develop because you're not clicking and dragging around the screen anymore, you're just going right to the point. So number five is something you've been listening to on this channel for a long time now. It's actually their Earthworks Ethos microphone from Earthworks Audio. And this is different from microphones like the Rode PodMic or the Shirt SM7B because this is actually considered a condenser microphone. So it handles those higher frequencies that allow you to more intelligently hear what someone's communicating. So maybe it's actually made my voice sound better than it actually is. I think it sounds warm. I think it has a lot of good sibilants where you need it so you can understand me. And it's also an American company. So if that matters to you, hey, it's got that going for it, as well as the fact that a lot of people aren't using it. So if you want to be a little bit different, a little more unique, check out the Earthworks Ethos. It's the best microphone that you can sit on your desk right now. The Yulonzi cooling fan for mirrorless cameras. Now this is super niche, but if you have a Sony a7 IV and you shoot video, you know the thing overheats, especially if you're using it as a webcam like I do. This is really simple to install. It just has a spring-loaded clamp. You stick it on there. It basically makes it into like an FX camera as far as reliability. It's a rechargeable USB built-in battery. And yeah, it'll just let you stream all day long. So been a big fan of this thing. It solved a big issue, which has just been overheating with the a7 IV. On the topic of camera equipment, I got to mention this guy. This is the Zhiyun Weeble S Gimbal. Now I'll tell you, Zhiyun, they reached out to me and said, hey, do you want to try a gimbal out? And I said, sure. So they sent me this for free. This is the first thing on the list I did not pay for. But I probably would have. And the reason why is because it's so small and lightweight and travel-friendly. So I can actually work with this thing. It's got an extra handle here. So I can work with this all day long without getting too tired because the weight is so much less than previous gimbals I've used, like the DJI Ronin S. And yes, that can hold heavier lenses. But most of the time I want a small, lightweight, wide lens, which this does great with. The other thing that the Zhiyun Weeble S is able to do is it has like locks on it, which make it easy for it to go into a backpack. So it's easy to travel with. Big fans so far are the Zhiyun Weeble S. If you're looking for something to increase your production value, this might be it. On the topic of camera related stuff, these are the Tentacle Sync E Mark II timecode boxes. Now these were sent to me for free, although I've bought lots of tentacle syncs in the past. These basically apply a number to your video file so that it can be synced up later in post-production. And basically you sync them up once during the day and it'll just run continuously. So you don't have to worry about doing the, you know, the hand clap sort of thing to get synced or having the cameras close enough to a good scratch audio to be able to sync things up. These are doing it with a number. The number is called timecode and it just makes it easy to work within Resolve. Now the reason I would say that these tentacle syncs are better than other options out there are sort of threefold. One is they have a real simple cable. This is all you need, this little thin cable to plug this into a Sony FX3. I love that. Another thing is their iOS app works really, really great and it even works with the Black Magic Camera app so you can have timecode on your iOS video files. So if you have one camera that's shooting with the phone as a pickup shot, hey that's great. The other thing I'll mention is they have an inbuilt rechargeable battery but a lot of companies they don't offer a way to replace that battery over time. So you know, batteries go bad over time then the thing turns into e-waste is a bunch of junk. Well you can actually get a replacement battery kit for these guys. So if you buy one of these tentacle syncs, it's going to be good for a long time because you can always go and swap out that battery later on and you still have the advantage of it being really tiny, rechargeable and it lasts all day long. Okay, last little camera item here. This is the JJC Bluetooth remote. I know this channel is about DaVinci Resolve and editing but there's some camera stuff that goes into making YouTube videos. This allows me to just trigger recordings easily by pushing that one button and in fact it also works with power zoom lenses so I can zoom in by holding a button on here. It'll zoom in. It's great if you have that. But yeah, I think just being able to push the button without jostling the camera is a super super valuable thing to have. The next bit of gear I think any editor needs is a good chair to sit in. So I'm going to get up for this one and show you what I use. It's actually the Steelcase Leap version 2 chair. This guy right here, they come in different colors. They're pretty heavy and you know if the chair is heavy it's probably good but no honestly I've been sitting in this for the past year and I haven't had any back issues. I was using a gaming chair and I couldn't sit in that for more than two hours at a time but the big pro tip I want to give you here, I'm not giving you a affiliate link, I'm just giving you a link to where I bought mine from. It's a Madison seating, does refurbs. So any of these high end chairs they usually cost north of $1,000 which is insane for a chair that you want to sit at at a desk but you can usually get this for about a third of the price if you get a refurb. That's what I did and like I said I use Madisonseating.com but I'm sure there's lots of others and it's just like new. Number 11 on the list is going to be a Hammerly Ceramics Coffee Mug and why I like this thing so much, it's a one of a kind handcrafted piece of ceramic that was made by Hammerly Ceramics but it has a function right? It lets me get coffee in my system which I need as a video editor. Now I'll tell you another thing that's important to think about when you're buying stuff these days is this was made by an artist for people that appreciate art. It was not made by some AI thing out there that automatically created it because a computer could do it. I just, I get inspired because an artist made this so I can go and make art myself. That's simple. Last but not least is this Watershed Okoei Dry Duffel Bag. Now this is not something you're going to find on Amazon probably. This is the best thing out there. It's lightweight and it's guaranteed to keep your stuff dry under a waterfall. It has a special patented Ziploc top to it. I took this recently this year on a canoe trip but I would easily take it whitewater kayaking, rafting on a ski trip anywhere where you might have a bunch of elements. Maybe you're camping and you'll have be caught in downpours. This is going to keep any electronic. It could be a camera, a phone, an iPad, computer dry and it's a really nice lightweight small size. So this is the Watershed Okoei Bag. Thanks for hanging out with me today. My name is Chadwick. Use the links below if you want to help out the channel so I can make more free DaVinci Resolve tutorials and because there's so much more to learn. I'll see you in the next video.
