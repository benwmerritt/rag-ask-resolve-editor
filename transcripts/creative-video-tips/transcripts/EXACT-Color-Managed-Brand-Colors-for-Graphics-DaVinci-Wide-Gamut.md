In the past, I've avoided project level color management in DaVinci Resolve because graphics would never match specific branding colors. But it actually turns out it is very possible to achieve accurate colors from Fusion Graphics, you know, the text plus or any sort of graphics template that you're using. And this is how I actually plan to work moving forward. Long story short, in Fusion, convert your Fusion-generated color with the Color Space Transform node that goes from SRGB to your Timeline Working Space. The Timeline Working Space is also known as the Color Processing mode in the project settings, but use Linear Gamma and check the box to apply Inverse OOTF. This is your new corporate brand color. But why does this work and what do I do if I change working color spaces and what if I don't even want to use a Color Space Transform at all? Physically accurate compositing. So in color grading, you hear about Gamma, which came as a solution to a problem from CRT TVs or maybe know about Log Footage, which originated as a solution for scanning motion picture film. Those are both nonlinear functions. And even our eyes actually, they behave in a nonlinear fashion too. But none of these nonlinear relationships of light exist in the physical world. Adding and subtracting light in the physical world is linear, so we should also comp in Fusion in linear without these transfer functions. And that is exactly what DaVinci Resolve Color Management does for us underneath the hood. So when you create a Fusion composition or use the text plus clip on the edit timeline with Resolve Color Management turned on, you're working in a color space that matches the Timeline Working Space, the Color Processing mode, often called the Gamma, the Primaries, Chromaticities. But it is converted to linear going into the Fusion page and then back out of linear as it leaves. You can check the working color space by opening up the subview menu and viewing the metadata. V as in Victor is the shortcut. And you'll find the actual chromaticities of the current working space. Fusion keeps the project gamut, but it linearizes the transfer function. And it's happening all behind the scenes. And you'll also notice there's a Fusion viewlet that's turned on. That's the little checkerboardy hash sort of looking thing so that you can view the linear image on your computer screen. Not this viewlet enabled, the image appears too dark and just like log, it's never actually intended to be viewed in this state for making creative or corrective adjustments. So it's just great that this is enabled by default. That's the Fusion viewlet. So linear light is perfect for compositing and placing objects and colors into the scene. But as you may have experienced, this is not my hexadecimal color that I need to be displaying correctly on my timeline for my text plus. Generated Hex Values. Normal color codes, also called hex numbers or values, they're often given an RGB triplet, listed in a brand guideline document somewhere. And they're always created and assumed to be in the sRGB color space. Thank you to Chris Zwar for reminding me of this over on ProVideoCollision. I created this document in Affinity Photo with sRGB with actual real brand colors for us to use as a reference. I'll even post a link so that you can download this PNG and test the workflow for yourself. The point is, brand colors are given a specific color space, which is really just a measurement system and brand color values only make sense within that particular measurement system, which is sRGB. Here I'm pouring one quart of liquid into a container in slow motion just because it looks cool. Remember, it's only one quart, but if I rotate around and you see the other side, we see a metric unit of one liter instead of a quart. A different measurement system or color space. It's not filling up to the same value of one on the metric side. You see one quart does not equal one liter. Now you already knew that. They're pretty close, you can see, but they are different. Some color spaces are closer than others, like Rec709 is close to sRGB, but it's not the same. And Resolve Color Management helps do the conversions for us. But for Fusion-generated colors, we do have to do an extra step to discover what the new brand colors are. So if you change the color space, it's changing the measurement system and the RGB value has to change to keep up with appearance. For example, this is Home Depot Orange, and these are all the different values that are required for the different color spaces. For wide gametes like DaVinci Wide Gamet and Linear, this can actually be very different from the original sRGB hex values. Or we can actually discover what F96302 means when we're working with DaVinci YRGB color managed with DaVinci Wide Gamet Intermediate. I do want to point out the importance of tagging clips that don't have metadata or may be interpreted wrong when they're brought into DaVinci Resolve. And basically anything that's not raw. So this clip right here was Blackmagic Raw. It gets converted correctly. You don't have any options to change it. Just takes care of it. But this was a still, this is a Sony clip. Clips like this needs to be tagged and interpreted. So you can either choose to do this on the color page. If you go to the color page, you can right click on a clip and you'll see input color spaces available to tag it as sRGB. Or if you have a lot of clips and want to do them in batches, you bring them in. You can do this in the media pool as well. So I say find in media pool. And once it's located in the media pool, you can right click over here as a batch and say input color space. And this is tagged as sRGB. So if it was Sony clips, tag it as sLog3Sgamet3Cine. So that's getting a fusion and I'll show you how we can pull and convert the color. So I'm going to zoom out just a little bit. I'm working with the mid-flow vertical workspace layout. A lot of people ask me this is the best way to work in fusion, in my opinion. Just lets you keep a stack over here on the right side and I like to work top down. Now the other thing we'll take a look at is how do we figure out what this color is. We're going to grab a background node, which is right up here. BG is the shortcut if you want to use the tool picker. But you generally, if you use the text plus tool, which uses fusion graphics, you would just choose a color. Type in F96302. We'll see the results of that and it's way too bright. This is what you're used to. But let's see a comparison of these two as we do a transform to figure out what the new color is. In fusion, there's actually a couple of viewers. At the top here we've got an A viewer and there's also a B viewer. If I go to the B buffer, the B viewer, I'm just going to click hold and drag my media in one across to here so I can see both. If I want to go back to my A viewer, there's the A viewer that's loaded into the A. If I want to see a split screen of them, this is why this is so handy. You can do this without even merging. I'll hit buffer, split, wipe. If I hit command F or control F, that does a zoom to fit. Let's say I want to move this over to here. You don't necessarily always need to zoom out in fusion. This is where you get the little bonus tips in my tutorials. Let's say we're into here, I'm going to hit command and option or it would be alt and control on a Windows machine. Those two buttons, they have option, command, hell, click, and then it just jumps that split wipe to wherever you click. Let's get these two matching. After this background node, even though yes, it is the F96302 value which has no color space, it's just we're viewing it in the wide gamut. We need to convert it. We're going to use the color space transform CST to get that. I'll load that onto my left viewer. Just clicking, dragging, releasing over there to that side. You can see it's transformed the image. I have some presets here from S-Log. We're not going to use that. I'm going to change my input color space to SRGB like I talk about at the very beginning of the tutorial. If you want to share that with someone, just share the beginning. It has all the instructions you need. We're going to change this here to output color space, DaVinci wide gamut, which is right there. Output gamut is linear. Remember, we take out the gamut when you come in and out of here. Then you do need to check this other box down here. Apply inverse OOTF when you're using SRGB as your input. Now we have a dead on match. If I move my cursor from left to right and you see these numbers that are down here at the bottom, they're exactly the same. How do we figure out what this actual value is to take a color swatch? Really simple. All you need to do is just grab another background node, just an empty one. With the new background node, you've got a color picker over here. Let's make use of that color picker. This time, instead of using the actual hex value. I'll just click on the color picker, drag it across to the left side. It's grabbing a 32-bit float value. It's extremely precise release. Now in this well, we've got a DaVinci Wide Gamut linear version of that SRGB hex value, which is now 153.55 to 27. You can drag this over to your well over here. I've done this a few times for practice. You could use just this color on any sort of text on the edit page and you'll have no issues at all getting things to match up. That will work with any of the colors that I have on this. You could practice and I encourage you to test me on this because it's just going to work. But if you did want to see these overlaid back onto the edit page because I didn't actually merge those yet, we could do that, I guess, really quickly. Let's take the color space transform, kissing this on top of here, creates a merge automatically. We do need to mask it off. I'm going to go just back over here, by the way, to one of my viewers and I'll take a look at that so I can draw my mask and see it. Polygon node. I teach a lot of fusion lately on this channel so if that's something you're into or any sort of high end commercial editing workflows, that's my jam. You can see with those match that's actually merged so I'm going to go to media out. We come over here and we have a dead on match and in fact if I take my Home Depot orange, it matches across the board. If we take a look at the color page, there's another little swatch over here just so you're aware of. You have the qualifier tool and then you right click, you can say RGB Picker Value and you can test me on this. So you can see what is the actual RGB value. Now it is 249.998, not 2 and I want to point out something here. We are outputting, we're seeing the output of the Color Managed Workflow which is Brexit of 9, Gamma 2.2. Gamma 2.2 is not sRGB. It's similar but at the bottom end especially, it's not the same. If they ever had to be super, super identical coming out, you could change this down here. If I change that to sRGB, hit save. Now you'll see we have a completely precise 249.992 from in to out. But honestly, nobody ever exports to sRGB. Everything that I do in my world is going to be 709.2.2, 2.4, 709.8, whatever you want it to be. And do expect a little bit of a change but we have maintained that color completely throughout the whole pipeline. Now the beauty is that you can change your output color space for different deliverables, different screens for instance, at any time and all your color grades and fusion graphics, they're just going to work. Project white color management in DaVinci Resolve is a wonderful thing. I mean it requires no extra nodes on the color page for raw or log encoded footage to appear correct on your Rec. 709 displays or your computer's screens but you still have all that flexibility to sculpt and grade your image and make corrections under the hood. I'm also told that you actually can get better performance using the project white color management instead of using nodes on the color page to form your display image. So now that you know how to find your new Texas Plus linear brand colors, hopefully you can embrace project white color management too. I'm Chadwick, I finish commercials for these brands and I would love to teach you everything that I know about Resolve. I often have one on one availability over Zoom and because there's so much more to learn, I'll see you in the next video.
