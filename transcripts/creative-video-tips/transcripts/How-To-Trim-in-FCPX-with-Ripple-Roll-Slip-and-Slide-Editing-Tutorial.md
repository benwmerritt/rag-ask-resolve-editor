Do you want to have complete control on the pacing and timing of your video? Well today I'm going to go over the four trimming tools that have been in editing applications as long as I can remember. Ripple, roll, slip, and slide. Here we go. Hey if you're new here I'm Chadwick. This is Creative Video Tips where I help you create videos that make a difference and stand out. If that's something you're into click subscribe right now so you don't miss our next tip. Video editing is storytelling and great storytelling involves communication and emotion and feeling and pacing and all that stuff is directly tied to trimming and a lot of people don't know but there are four great tools built into all of the editing applications to trim and I'm going to walk you through each one of them and show you why you would use them and how to use them. Let's jump into the computer right now. So the first thing you want to do is you're going to jump up in Final Cut Pro. You want to adjust your preference. Okay so you go to preferences and the editing tab you want to make sure that you have a checkbox on show detailed trimming feedback and what that does is when you start trimming is it gives you a left and a right so it's an incoming and outgoing or A and B side of your clip. If you don't have that preference checked in here for timeline show detailed trimming feedback you're not going to see those and that's really important because you want to be able to see both sides of your edit when you're making a change. Now that we have our preferences set up I'm going to show you how to do ripple trims and there's two types of ripple trims that are really important to know. One is we're going to be using the select tool so just A and what this is going to do if you hover close to an edit point you can shorten it or extend it and that changes the overall length of the entire project so you can see it's basically sucking up the end of a clip and it makes the whole project shorter and you can do that on both sides so you can clip and click and drag on either side and because we have that preference set we can see up here in the top the incoming and outgoing clips. Now the next way you could do a ripple trim here is if you go to the position tool so if you click P this behaves a little different and it's it's more like a default in other editing applications that aren't final cut. What this is going to do it's going to maintain the overall duration of the project and insert black filler where you're cutting away from frames and it's easier just to see this than explain it so with the P selected the position tool I'm going to do the same thing I click and drag and you can see as I'm doing this we have inserted black filler into the area you can do that on both sides that's going to extend the black filler but what we haven't done is we haven't changed the length of a project that could be really important if you have like music timed out on one section and you don't want all of that stuff to get shifted so you're going to jump between the A and P tools when you're doing ripple trims in Final Cut Pro 10. Alright let's join these back up real quick so I still have P selected and we can do that and they'll just click and drag right together. Now the next three trimming tools are really awesome and they don't affect the overall length of a project but they're all about fine tuning and getting things to feel exactly how you want them to feel maybe it's something landing on a beat or a sound effect matching something it could really be anything but the way we access this next one which is called a roll edit in Final Cut Pro it's also called a dual roller trim which I think makes more sense once you see it here so to do that we're going to go over to our tools again and this is we're going to choose the trim tool and to use the trim tool it now gives me a new option that I didn't get with the arrow or the petal isn't it gives me this one that has markers that are sort of going left and right of the edit this is a kind of a magical thing and what it will do is if you drag one direction like say I'm dragging to the right here I'm adding frames to the clip on the left and I'm subtracting the exact same number of frames to the one on the right so this is a great way to keep your timing of the whole project or you know scene or something the same but to put a little bit more emphasis or time or length on one clip than the other so this is a roll or dual roll edit one thing I will note about these dual roll edits is that you need to have handles so that's kind of the the thing with all of these you if you have not sort of pre-selected segments of clips before you cut them in your timeline or trim them you will eventually come to a limit of a clip so this one you can say it took me a while to get there that's the end of when the record button was pushed so you can obviously only trim or roll out as far as you know was recorded I can still remember the first time someone explained to me a slip trim and my mind was pretty much blown I don't know if it's going to blow your mind but I think this is still pretty a remarkable way to fine-tune things on your timeline to do a slip trim you are going to be in the the trim mode here or the trim tool and what a slip trim does is this basically saying hey I still want my edit to be here and I want my edit point to be here but I want the inside guts of it to be different so I want the inside guts to be from an earlier or later part of this container so I've got this picture here with my dog or this this video clip with the dog and you can see it starts with him and he's just or she is just hanging out and then she heads off screen right one thing um maybe I wanted her to be a little bit more off screen before we cut to the next clip the easiest way to do this without changing the timing would be to use the slip tool so what we do is you just with trim selected you hover over anywhere inside the clip area which is also why I have these these clips are super huge by the way if you want to make them smaller or larger you can do that over here um I don't have bad eyesight or anything I just like saying things big so and I have a big 27 inch monitor so I do it anyways back to slip if you click on here and then it's a click and drag now you can see we have cool little indicators there in Final Cut Pro those yellow brackets and then they're pointing to the inside so what we're changing is the inside guts and these little thumbnails that are in there are kind of showing us that hey I'm changing where the shot that's inside of there is beginning and ending but I'm not affecting the shots around it and I'm not affecting the overall length of the timeline which can be really helpful and then if you're looking up above at the viewers we get to see a great preview of hey this is where that last frame is um when I'm doing the trim so let's say for instance I want Roxy our cute little girl Mutt pup to get off screen I'm going to be dragging here to the left right now until she's completely off and then releasing the mouse and now I've effectively made that change so that you know she's she looks she runs off screen and then we cut to another shot now that's you know that's probably not a great match to another clip but you get the idea of how that works so it's just as simple as hitting T for trim mode and then clicking and dragging around the guts I think you're going to probably use this this slip tool the slip trimming method a lot once you get used to making those final tweaks at the end and you don't want to mess any other timing up so the last main trimming method I want to talk about is sliding a clip sliding a clip is we're still using the trim tool over here so T for trim and what you're going to do with a slide is you're going to basically be doing a roll remember roll is adding and subtracting the same number of frames from each side of an edit but we're going to do a roll on both sides of a clip so it maintains the length of the whole project and it basically moves it around within itself and I'll show you what I'm talking about so to do it you just hold option and then you can click when you have the T tool selected so I'm moving left here and you can see we are basically moving this clip forward in time but the length of the project is staying the same pretty nifty huh so if I move left we're basically taking away a frame from the clip that's to the left and adding that to the clip that's on the right but the clip in the center is staying exactly the same another way of performing basically the same thing that I see most people do more often is if it's on a you know a timeline that's above or something so let's say we have this up higher here we could you know maybe be joining two cuts and you can move this left and right on here so that's another way of sort of doing the same sort of deal the disadvantage to doing an edit this way is really you don't have that sort of precision feedback monitor deal whatever they call it where you can see the incoming and out coming shots so in this mode right here you can see I can see that what I'm basically taking away on the shot on the left and what's coming in on the shot of the right I would do have to say added has a little heads up on this one because it's going to show you four screens it's actually going to show you the the inside of that clip that you're actually moving around in time rather than just the two but I think seeing these two is is a really all I need most of the time so that is sliding the last thing I want to show you just because we're in final cut today is the precision editor this is a thing that's unique to Final Cut Pro X it's one of the things that make it really easy to see what you're doing and I'll just jump in and show you how to do it or use it so to access it if you just use the select tool the a tool double click the transition and this crazy new thing opens up so what this is they call it the precision editor and it lets you see what's happening and it lets you make an adjustment with it super blown up in your face you can see the beginning and end of a clip and see how much handle which handle is the amount of clip you have that's sort of outside of what you have on your timeline how much you have of that available left so by just double clicking that you can perform all you know ripples and rolls from within there so the way you would do a roll with just the mouse is you can drag right down here and the parts that are going to be visible are the parts that are brighter so you'll see this part and this part and then these parts that are dimmed out you are not going to see in your edit if you wanted to like do a ripple trim on it you would click from up here and you can see we're we're actually making the project shorter and same thing if we clicked over here we'd be making the project shorter and you can also jump around between edit points within this mode by just clicking these other dots so kind of a neat little interface i don't use a whole lot but i think it's a really useful learning tool and then the way you get out of it is you can just you can double click or hit escape and then you're back to seeing things a lot more simplified now you are a trimming master and you can control pretty much anything on the timeline if you got anything out of this video please click subscribe that'll let me know i'm doing a good job and i'll see you in the next video
