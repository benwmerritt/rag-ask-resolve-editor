Setting up a shared high-speed 10 gig network for video editing has just become accessible for everyone. I just purchased the Blackmagic Cloud Pod to use with the Venture Resolve 18 shared project libraries. So today we're diving into the top five things I love about it and a few of the opportunities to explore the unmet potential. If you're curious what the heck a Blackmagic Cloud Pod is, the simplified TLDR explanation is that it turns an off-the-shelf USB hard drive into a network shared storage volume that can be mounted and used by several editors all at once. So just one copy of the footage all inside one shared project. This helps you work faster to complete a video, but it also helps boost the quality of your masterpiece by sharing ideas and collaborating throughout the whole post-production process. The Cloud Pod, it also connects to the internet to push and pull files to Dropbox, so that way you can work from wherever you want in the world with another editor or colorist anywhere in the world. Just think about the power this has to improve your quality of life. Pro 1 Local Collaboration. The Blackmagic Cloud Pod has two USB-C ports. One is initially used to configure and update the Pod with the free Cloud Store setup driver, but both will accept any disk as long as they're formatted as Mac OS Extended or XFAT. That means I have some reformatting that I need to do with my SSDs that are APFS. That doesn't work. So I use a pair of these SSDs and plug them in for my initial testing. Turning these Direct Attach storage drives into Network Attach storage is as simple as plugging them in after connecting to the Cloud Pod's 10Gb Ethernet port to hopefully a 10Gb network switch. Then your network switch should be plugged back into each of your computers. Now stay tuned towards the end of this video to learn what specific gear I'm using in addition to the Cloud Pod. Now the reason it's so simple to set up is because you can leave all your settings configured with DHCP, which means you don't need to learn how to assign a static IP address. It's on automatic mode. Side note, if you need that control, you can certainly enter a static IP and route your traffic accordingly. To mount a Cloud Pod volume on a Mac, just open a Finder window and go to Network. Click on Blackmagic Cloud Pod, and then click the disk you want to use. If it doesn't appear on your Mac desktop, just go up to Finder Preferences and check the box for connected servers. Every computer on the same network can mount these drives simultaneously and once they're mounted, since you can open a shared project using the Blackmagic Cloud tab, enable multiple user collaboration, and work together in the same project at the same time. The whole setup is this simple. I tell you, I've been working in post for 20 years and resolve sharing tool set. It blows all the other NLE's collaboration features out of the water. So I have a free in-depth tutorial on all the collaboration features built directly into Dimitri Resolve 18 that you're going to want to watch after this review. Pro 2, Remote Collaboration. The next thing I love about the Blackmagic Cloud Pod is the cloud part of it. And I can't talk about the cloud without proxies. The Cloud Pod is excellent at syncing proxy files to help enable collaboration in different physical locations. That could even be in different countries. And what's unique about using a cloud store or cloud pod is the ability to sync a proxy version exclusively, which lives in a folder next to the camera originals. And this saves you bandwidth and cloud storage space. Speaking of cloud space, it uses Dropbox, which has worked fine, but they're also going to have Google Drive support soon as well. Oh, and don't worry, if you choose to only sync the proxies, it'll also include all of your non-video assets in that synced folder. In contrast, if you use the desktop Dropbox app, you're going to need to do some manual moving and extracting of the proxy files. Now, what are proxy files? Proxy files are low bandwidth, easier to edit and send over the internet, standard video files for the larger camera originals. They're enabled by default on your playback, proxy hand-lead dropdown, and they just work behind the scenes. And your exports are still going to use the full, high quality resolution footage for exporting as long as they're connected to your computer. Creating proxy files is super simple with a new free app they included called Blackmagic Proxy Generator. You add a folder with video files, pick a format, and it'll create 6 megabit per second copies of the original footage, and it's going to happen in the background. It could even process on another computer you're not using to edit with on the same network. So, the cloud pod, it's a set it and forget it tool when used in conjunction with the Blackmagic Proxy Generator app. It won't tie up a video editing's workstation's resources with another app running like the Dropbacks app because itself is hooked directly into the interwebs over the Ethernet cable. That's it. Yeah, this is acting as a NAS, so I open up in Premiere Pro and it works. What I wasn't sure about is if it will actually easily connect to the proxy files created by the Blackmagic Proxy Generator for smoother playback, but it does. To hook those proxy files up, which by the way in Resolve, it's just all auto-magic, is in Premiere, select the clips, right click to choose Proxy and attach proxies. Now you can edit like a hot knife through butter. If you need to collaborate on the same project, you could look into using Premiere Pro Productions. I wouldn't recommend it when Davinci Resolve also exists, but hey, it's there. Did I mention collaboration works with the free version of Davinci Resolve 18? And all you have to spend is $5 per month on a cloud project library and only one person on your team needs to spend that. And also your projects aren't stuck there, so afterwards you can cancel the fee after a month if you needed to. Oh, and it's also backed up by their servers too. Anyways, moving on to Final Cut Pro 4. See what I did there? Oh, I'm awful. The fourth thing that's helpful is that the Blackmagic Cloudpot also works with Final Cut Pro. You just mount it like any other external hard drive and the proxy files work there too. To connect the proxies in Final Cut, go to File, Reeling Files and choose Proxy Media. Use the schema on the timeline and you can see the monitoring app start to dance as it's reading and writing to the disk. Pro 5. Silence. I like a quiet space. Silence helps me think and process ideas. It's also helpful if you record YouTube tutorials like this one and many others I have here on Creative Video Tips that are here to help you create videos that make a difference and stand out. So while you're thinking about and processing the idea of subscribing right now, just know that if you pair the Cloudpot with a set of solid state drives that are silent and a quiet space, you're going to be a happy camper. Alright, you get the picture. I make tutorials on DaVinci Resolve. My name's Chadwick. Let's move on to the cons. Con 1. USB-C. The Blackmagic Cloudpot uses Gen 1 of USB-C. This puzzles me why they chose to use this because it maxes the USB throughput to 5 gigabits per second and the device advertises and has a 10 gigabit ethernet connection. NVMe SSDs like a Samsung T7 are faster than 5 gigabits per second, so we would have seen that improvement. I think this was an opportunity to explore the Unimet potential. Maybe this was a cost savings to us consumers, but I would have paid a little bit extra for Gen 2 in a faster USB port. Would you? Let me and Blackmagic know in the comments. I'm really curious. And the 10 gigabit speed that's advertised on the Blackmagic page is just misleading because it's only talking about the ethernet port and you're never going to see 10 gig speeds from a Gen 1 USB connected to it. However, using the Blackmagic disk speed test app, I averaged around 3 to 3.5 gigabits per second over my 10 gigabit capable network. This would be about half of the SSD speed if it was directly connected to the MacBook Pro, but... And this is a big but that's really important to understand. When I'm working with proxy footage, 6 megabit per second proxy footage, or even my Sony FX300 megabit per second footage, I don't even come close to saturating a single gigabit worth of bandwidth. That's like 6 or 100 out of 3,000 bits available. 6 or 100 out of 3,000. So for small post teams of 3 to 6 editors, I don't know that this is much of a limitation. And you can still push 80 gigs of video over this connection in just 3 or 4 minutes. But what is frustrating is that it's advertised with 10 gigs all over their website. Con 2, the extra gear. The second thing you need to be aware of is that the Blackmagic CloudPod is not the only bit of kit you're going to need to get the most out of it if you're not already set up with 10 gig networking. A standard port or switch on a computer is generally 1 gig and that's going to work, but that's the most you'll ever get. With a 10 gig router and Thunderbolt adapter, you're going to easily triple that speed. But it's going to cost you. So the gear I ended up purchasing was a pack of 5 Cat 6A Ethernet cables. Now, Cat 6 is going to work fine and it's really all you should bother with if you're going to go with a single gig connection. Then for the 10 gig switch, I picked up this little tiny Ubiquiti USW Flex XG. So you put that down below. It runs around $350 and I picked this up over another popular option that's called the MicroTik or MicroTik 5 port desktop switch. And that's because I already have and love using Ubiquiti access points and it's easy to manage them with a single controller to see all of my networking gear. I'm a big Ubiquiti fan. I think their stuff is great. Now, the MicroTik switch also has SFP ports, which means you're going to also need to purchase an RJ45 module, which makes that switch more expensive than the 175 books that it seems on the surface. But it's probably more flexible because you could use fiber optic cable. Both of these switches have four fast ports. You plug your cloud pod into one of them and then you plug up to three computers into the other. So they're suitable network switches for up to three editors. The other port, it's for your internet. And then since I use a MacBook Pro, there isn't an Ethernet port on it, right? So I'm using an OWC Thunderbolt 3 to 10 gig Ethernet adapter. They run around $200 each. And in hindsight, if I didn't already own an OWC dock with a one gig port, I would have purchased the OWC Pro dock, which has a 10 gig Ethernet port built in. But that does run up to $400. It would just be less gear on my desk. Now, I put affiliate links to these products down below. If any of my tutorials help you make better videos, this is one of the best ways you can help support the channel. That way I can purchase more tools to evaluate them for you like this black magic cloud pod. And a side note to the external Ethernet adapter. If you run a PC, you can likely add an internal 10 gig card for less than $200. I just don't have any specific recommendations. Oh, and if you buy a Mac Studio, they come standard and Mac Minis, they have them as a worthwhile upgrade. My next opportunity to explore the unmet potential is that we want to monitor the CloudPod activity by typing an IP address into a web browser instead of plugging into an HDMI display. Well, the HDMI display, it's fantastic and it's clever. But I want to see this blinky light show from any desk in my network. Heck, I'd love to log in outside of my network to see and help troubleshoot any issues. If this is possible, let me know. Maybe I missed something here. So who's this device for? I think it's for anyone who edits videos with another person or team of people remotely or in the same building. Or it's also great for editors that might work in multiple locations on different computers and they want to work with Dropbox and Google Drive to send their proxies home to the office rather than carrying around an external hard drive. But I think the best use case is for collaboration. Working from the same media at the same time inside the same project. And guess what? I have a full in-depth tutorial going over all of the collaboration features that blow all the other editing apps out of the water linked up for you to watch next. Thank you so much for watching. And because there's so much more to learn, I'll see you in the next video.
