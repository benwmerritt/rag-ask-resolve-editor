Hey, this is Chadwick with a quick tutorial to show you how to move a project from Final Cut 7 to 10. With the most recent updated version of Final Cut 10.0.3, there was a utility from Greg Clark and Philip Hodgets that allows you to export a Final Cut 7 sequence XML and import it into 10.0.3. You can get the translation app from the App Store and find out more info at assistedediting.com. The process is super straightforward. In Final Cut 7, make sure you have all your media online and the sequence you want to convert open. Then create an XML file by going to File, Export, XML, pick version 5. I also included clips outside the selection. Now jump over to Final Cut Pro 10. Open up the 7-10 application which you download from the App Store and import the XML file. 7-10 does its magic and gives you a compound clip of your Final Cut Pro 7 sequence in the Event Library. Now you can see everything translated pretty much perfect in this example with a couple exceptions that I expected. Freeze frames don't come across. I had three videos stacked on the left part of the screen here and there's also another one at the end of the compound clip. This makes sense because FCPX or 10 doesn't do freeze frames the same way that the legacy versions of Final Cut Pro do. Finally, also the footage also had the Colorista 2 filters on them for color correction and they're all gone now. This is expected. Be sure to check out known issues on their website but so far I'd say I'm super impressed by this translation application and it's allowing me to move forward into FCPX 10 editing without worrying about past projects being obsolete. Definitely check it out if you're thinking about taking the FCPX 10 plunge because it just works. Feel free to leave comments and questions and also check out my site ChadwickPaul.net for more post-production and DIY photo related tips. Thanks for watching.
