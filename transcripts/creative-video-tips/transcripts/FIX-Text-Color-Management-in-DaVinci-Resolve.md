Editing with a project-wide or timeline-wide DaVinci wireGV color-managed workflow can really simplify your color grading and compositing. I mean, you're gonna have less notes. But there is a problem with it as soon as you add any Fusion-generated graphics or titles. See in older versions, white became gray and that was real obvious, but this is fixed and resolved 19's automatic HDR color management setting which I'm using right now. But still, Fusion-generated colors like this Home Depot specific orange hex value of F96 302, it gets shifted. See this is the same color value entered on the solid color generator as well as on the text plus title and you see it's stacked up, it has completely different results. It's like a totally different shade of orange. By the way, this is just a simple text plus from the edit page titles panel, but because it's a text plus tool, it's actually a Fusion-generated graphic or color. So even if you never plan to open up Fusion, which of course I hope you do, this tutorial matters for you. My current project settings are DaVinci wireGV color-managed with the checkbox for automatic color management with the timeline processing using the HDR preset. My output color space is set to SDR-REC709 which is gonna give me the 111 QuickTime NCLC tags which is gonna be perfect for any sort of delivery that I do. After you change the color science in the project settings to DaVinci color-managed, all the raw clips are gonna get normalized to display correctly on a Rec709 screen. Now don't worry, you still have all the flexibility that's underneath the hood to manipulate the color and exposure. You haven't essentially baked all this down like a LUT might do. That would be early in your tree. Now if it's not a raw clip, you can right click to tag the input color space which is something I often do with Sony S-Log footage just like this. Bam, great starting point. The first part of the solution is to right click on the text plus title tool and check the box to bypass color management. Once you've checked that, you're gonna see that this fixes the problem when the graphic is not superimposed on a layer above anything else, but even just like a black solid generator underneath it so it's actually doing a composite, this is gonna show a jump in color when the text plus is over it even with bypass color management turned on. So the final step to avoid the color-managed color shift is just to render in place after you've clicked to bypass color management on the clip. Render in place if you're not familiar, it helps you get real-time playback with any heavy effects by creating a standalone video file that swaps it out for you right there on your sequence. It's kind of like as if you went to the deliver page, you exported the video file into a single clip and then you brought it back into your project and then you recut it and conformed it into your timeline. But this one function does all of those steps just at once for you. It's that powerful and it's reversible. Did I mention that? Another great thing about render in place files is you can trim them just like any other video file or put them anywhere else like in a collaborative cloud project, which is something you cannot do with a render cache file. So before rendering in place for a title graphic, make sure your timeline resolution is your final export resolution. Because sometimes we edit at 1080 and then we change it before we export at 4K. You want to make sure you at least temporarily change your timeline or project setting to 4K if you want to make a 4K title. It's going to use your timeline settings. Timeline settings matter. Now also select a render's bin before rendering so that way you can stay organized as you go. So everyone is going to place the rendered quick time in the selected bin as it's created. Then just right click or even batch select a bunch of these and choose render in place. The format I like to use is quick time and the codec does matter here. We need an alpha channel. We need the transparency. So on a Mac I use Apple ProRes 4.4.4.4 and on a Windows computer use DNxHR 4.4.4. Probably the 12-bit version would be the best. Now if you need to make a change at any point later on you can just right click on the clip to say decompose to original, revise the text and then you just render in place again. Now I'm going to warn you one consideration when using project wide or timeline based color management is for graphics when they're added to a clip as like an effect or as a transition like a preset. In other words a fusion graphic where the color is like internally comps to your footage. I don't know of a solution here because we can't really bypass the color management and in that case I might use node based color management instead. Darren Mosten, Colin Kelly, they're the masters at this. You should check out their channels for sure. I'm Chadwick. I am a DaVinci Resolve master trainer. I'm stoked that you're here and because there's so much more to learn I'll see you in the next video.
