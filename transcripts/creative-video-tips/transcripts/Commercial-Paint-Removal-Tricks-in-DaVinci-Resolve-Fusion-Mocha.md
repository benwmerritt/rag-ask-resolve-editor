Today, as my Christmas gift to you, I'm going to show you my advanced techniques of using frequency separation with paint over infusion for a DaVinci Resolve, along with Mocha Pro to track something that is really untrackable with the built-in planar tracker, all to remove a zit from an actress's face that otherwise looks awesome. Let's get to it. The clip that we're working on today is available on Art Grid, and there is a little bit of acne right there in the middle of our chin. That's what we're going to focus on and try to remove. Let's open up Fusion. You could hit Shift 5, or it's this little button right there to get into here. I like to personally work with what's called the Mid View, and it's a top-down approach to working infusion, because it just gives me a bigger viewer over here on the left side, single viewer. Also, I like to use a Wacom stylus with the middle mouse set to that bottom button, which lets me quickly zoom into any sort of pixel that I need to, if I need to go straight into that acne that we're going to be removing. The way you get to mid-flow, by the way, is workspace and layout presets, fusion presets, and then just choose mid-flow. That'll basically give you this top-down area to work. The other thing is with the nodes, there is a setting that works a little bit better for vertical flows. If you hit Ctrl in this grid area, you have the option for a range tool. What is it? Options. Build flow vertically. That's just another useful thing to know about, and that's how I like to work. Now, the first thing you need to do is track this shot. I'm going to skip you the whole pain of trying to track this with the built-in planar tracker that is in fusion. It's just not going to work. It can't handle this steam that we're dealing with right here. Instead, I'm going to show you how Mocha Pro works, and it's how I would typically jump to anything that has any sort of weird occlusion that's just not going to work any other way. To load Mocha Pro, I'm using a lot of shortcuts in this tutorial, but I'm going to try to call them out. Shift space pulls up your tools list, and I'm just going to type in Mocha Pro. That's installed. It's licensed. I pay for it myself, even though they do have a discount code below. To load this up as a Mocha Pro instance or whatever, you just say launch Mocha UI, and you wait a second, and it opens up this whole new interface. In Mocha Pro, this is not a full Mocha Pro tutorial, but I'm going to show you how easy it can be to track this area, because the goal is we're going to try to stabilize this region so we can paint on this region using frequency separation, and then we're going to apply the motion right back to it. That's the function that we're going to be doing today. Let's start on a frame that where the blemish and everything is as large as possible in screen, and I'll show you how to track. Up here in the upper left, we've got these different buttons. I generally choose this X-spline to start drawing on the frame, and if you hold down Z here in Mocha and sort of drag, you get a little closer view. The idea is when you choose the tool again, the idea is when you're drawing here that this is all on the same planar space, like it's all in a flat region. This isn't quite exactly the case, but it's close enough for what we're doing, and then to close the shape up, you hit control and tap, and that closes the shape up. The shape here is the actual texture that is being tracked. People get confused when they're doing corner pin tracking that you can only have four points on a shape or even the planar track or infusion. That's not true at all. You make the shape on areas that you want to track, the texture to change between pixels. Now the part that's actually getting tracked, and then I'm curious about how good it is, is stored in the surface. So up here, there's this button called the surface tool, and what I want to do for blemishes, I want to take this cross here and move this directly over the blemish, so I can see how well the track holds. So the surface area is our track information that we're taking back to fusion, and the shape is the area that it's looking to track. Hopefully that makes sense. Now before we actually start to track this, down here in the lower section, and by the way, if you don't see all these available here, there's an essentials mode that it usually opens up in first, and then I generally work in classic mode, which just gives us more options down here. I'm only interested in translation, scale, and rotation for this particular shot. Now a lot of times if you're doing roto of people and stuff, I'll add shear, and every single time I'm doing something that's like a wall or a screen replacement, you have to add perspective. Otherwise, it's not going to be correct. Now that that is set, we can just hit track forwards, which is this button right down here, we're parked on our first frame, and we'll see if that holds through all of that. Oh, it got a little bit messed up on some of that steam there. I saw it wiggle. So we're going to go back and try to, you know, we can redo that by just changing the shape a little bit. So I know there's more steam on this side of the frame, so what I'm going to do is just select those and drag those over a little bit. I don't even have to have that, you know, that blemish included in the shape, but I am for now. Let's try it with this shape and see what I'm looking at is the surface area is that moving, especially that point, because I want that to be locked in pretty, pretty solid. And I'm letting this go through while screen recording. And that looks pretty good to me. So now the next thing is how do we get this data back into the resolve fusion to actually make use of it and stabilize the area to paint on it? Well, there's a couple of ways to do that. Basically, the idea, though, is this surface area is the tracking information. So that's what the area we're going to have useful to paint. So all I'm going to do here is I'm going to make this surface area larger. Okay, I'm expanding this, because this will be the stabilized area that I have to work. And I just want to have make sure I have plenty of skin to clone from. So now that I've got that expanded, you go down here to export track, you say black magic fusion comp data, you've got all these options and in Milka pro copied a clipboard. Now here's the catch. Hit save and close. Don't go straight back to fusion or it crashes like the host thing just doesn't work. And now that's stored in our clipboard, we can come over here, click anywhere you click in this flow area is where it's going to paste, then you hit command V to paste. And we have a standard tracker tool that basically is going to stabilize this this section of the frame. Now you're probably wondering how the heck do is this is a regular tracker, this is not even a planar tracker. Well, this is actually so how you can use all the corner position data you get from Mocha here in fusion, you take the output, and you plug this in twice, you plug it into the background and the foreground. And I throw this over here, and nothing's happened yet, because we need to go over to operation, it's set to none right now, we're going to use perspective positioning to stabilize. Okay, basically, you're going to be perspective to stabilize and then corner position to add motion back in. That's what how I remember. So perspective positioning is going to stabilize the image. And we could just choose foreground only. Okay, so if I take a look here, and play now, this part of the frame doesn't move at all. So it's a stabilized image, it's like if you were going to Photoshop, and just paint on it. And so let's set up our frequency separation. Frequency separation, basically, what that's doing is it's separating our low frequency, which is our color information, and the high frequency, which is the texture and detail information. So to do that, we are going to load up a blur. And let's load up a channel Booleans, BOL is that make sure you don't do the 3d one, just the regular channel Booleans. And what we're going to do to first get our texture information on this image is feed our tracker, a stabilized image into the blur. And what I want to do is I want to blur this until this blemish goes away. And we just have a clean color. So over here, we're going to keep blurring, blurring, blurring until that point where it looks nice and smooth. So I would say right around there, it feels pretty darn smooth. It's pretty blurry too. We're at a 25 pixel blur or something on this image. Now with the channel Booleans, we're going to do what's called a subtraction and addition. You could also do a division and multiply, but for Caucasian skin especially, the subtraction addition seems to work really nicely. So I'm going to do subtract. And we're going to do nothing to the alpha channel. So we're going to subtract all those out. And what we're doing is we're going to take our original stabilized image, feed it into here, and we're going to subtract out the blurred image from the foreground. And what that has just done is it's basically given us a detail section. And so if we feel like we haven't smoothed that out enough, I think that's pretty good. You can increase the blur. Now the next thing we need to do is we need to put this all back together because anytime we tear stuff apart, we build it back together. The way we do that is with an addition channel Booleans. So I've got this one that subtracted and I'm going to do command C to copy that, click down here where I wanted to land command V. And on this channel Booleans, we're going to do add. So what we're doing for the add is we're going to add this the the frequency with the blurred one. And we will come back here, we have exactly this the same image because we haven't done any painting yet. So the idea here is that this image here from the tracker is exactly the same as this. Because it's just math on those pixels, right? So now it's time to do some painting. And where does the paint go? Well, the paint is going to go in the high frequency part of the image because we're going to take we're going to be basically taking the texture information from here and placing it there. So let's grab a paint tool. And it'll go right after this guy. So shift space, paint. And the paint tool we're using, the way I'm going to be doing this is with this right here, which is called, I think it's called stroke, but it's basically it's the one that applies to all the frames, not just one single frame. And then over here, we're going to choose clone, because we want to clone. And actually, I also want to choose snap offset. What snap offset does is it makes sure that I'm actually cloning like full pixels. So there's not some inter interpolation between the two. And so anyways, now you can where we've got the paint loaded, I can zoom in real easily with my Wacom because I just hold the middle mouse in the area that I want to be cloning. And we have this whole area stabilized. If I want to change the brush size, you can hold down command, and it changes the brush size. And the other really nice thing about having a Wacom is under brush controls over here, you can see tablet settings, we have very opacity by pressure. So as I push harder, I'm laying down more paint. It's just like Photoshop. So the way we actually start to paint is you hold option to sample a region. Okay, so I'm gonna hold option to sample this texture area right here. And then I'm going to just lightly brush that texture from the one area to the other. And then let's see there's a little discoloration there. You can kind of do that over there. And we didn't even do this little white spot. I didn't think we need to do that, but you can just kind of clean and smooth out some other color areas that are beyond that blemish. And then you always want to make sure to zoom out to see how you're doing. So I'm holding down that middle mouse, and then let the footage play out. So this is a stabilized frame. And you can see if there's there's anything that that is not really working. I think especially for tutorial sake and keeping things moving, we're in a pretty good spot. So if we want to see before, you can see right there. And here is our after cleanup is right there. Now I know you're seeing this spot right here. This would probably need a different track because that's very much a different plane. But I think we're in a pretty good spot. So to put the motion back on, that's what you're wondering now, right? You put the motion back on by taking the same tracker right here, you do a command C, click over here where you want to land command V. And you can send the output of this cleanup that we did into both areas like we did prior, throw that over there. And it hasn't done anything, it just blew up more traffic. Well, that's because under operation, it was still set to perspective positioning. So under here, you just change this to corner positioning. And we have that motion moving again. However, I will say one thing that is we we I skipped over a step to prove a point here, we have a whole bunch of pixels were moving. And then removing, and we want to limit that to a very specific part of the screen, the part that we're changing and cleaning up. And so what I want to do is I actually want to just maybe make a little cut out of this section and only have that part be affected for how we putting this all together. So the way I'm going to limit that is actually, I really love channel Boolean. So let's just add another one of those to sort of cut out the area of the cleanup that that we had done. So while looking at the the uncleaned up area, we can take a B spline tool, which we've got polygon and B spline B splines are my favorites, because they're nice and smooth. And you can just come over here. And kind of, oh, I guess we did some stuff over here too. Just just, you know, if you're just doing one spot, you just do the one area and make a little mask with it unhooked while you're drawing it. That's kind of important. And then also, as soon as I draw mask infusion, I always want to get almost always want to get rid of the whatever the B spline polyline, the key frame that's on it. Because if I'm not rotoing, I don't want to accidentally start moving this. If I moved it to different frame, it would key frame automatically. So we're going to hook this into channel Boolean's. It hasn't done anything yet that we wanted to because I want this to cut out that area we just selected. And that the way you do that is you go to settings, multiply by mask. And since we do that, now we have our little cut out of it. And in fact, I might go back to this B spline area and soften the cut out just a hair. Before you do that, one thing I would probably do is come into here and remove the controls. So controls command K on a Mac gets rid of those. So you can actually use the soft edge control while holding command at very fine increments. To really just kind of, it's what it's doing is it's softening the edge right there. So that it'll blend a little bit, you won't see such a hard line. So you might just do that with with command, which is really nice with floating point. And we come back over to here, you can see our patch, and then you go to this one, the patch is moving. And now all we need to do is stick this patch back on top of the original footage. And if you'd use fusion before, I think you know about the merge tool, that's what we're headed next. So coming back over to our flow, we're going to grab the good old merge tool, it's shift space merge, I don't know, MRG, and we're taking the yellow background, okay, the full original source image, right. And we're going to plug in our patch, which is right there. And you'll see the magic happen. So that's going over the top, the green goes on top. And look at that. It's gone. You can especially once it's zoomed out, command F, zoom to fit, you can't even tell it was there. So if you look at the, and then the next thing is to get this back to the edit page is very simple. You can disconnect media out from there, media out means that the footage is being rendered back to the timeline. Okay, so when you go back to the edit page, it's there. But before we do that, I'm going to show a quick way of doing a split screen here in fusion. And that is, right now, we're loaded in our a buffer that's shown right here. If you want to switch to your B buffer, which is also it's the comma period, and then the question mark the slash key to change between these, let's get our B buffer loaded with the original image, by just dragging that over into there. Now we've got an A and a B buffer, what there's actually a split here too. So what the split does is it gives us a line. And the way I always, because I just wanted to see the word of the line is, I'm going to hit command and option by clicking. Oh, I'll tell you one thing that just happened, we turned our controls off for messing with that polygon mask. And so make sure you show your controls back on if if you do that at any point, I should have done that before. And it's a command K, while you're in that area. Well, it's funny. It, anyways, we'll just skip past that just ignore me on that one. But you can see here is the A side, the A side is our after the B sides are before, you can see we've gotten rid of those spots. You can kind of check it on different frames. And the only pixels we've affected are what's on that patch. So that's the only part that would potentially get a little bit softer from what's called filtering. And so anyways, that is basically how we've taken this patch here, we've laid it on top of the background image to clean things up. And I think it's done a pretty nice job to see this back over in the edit page now, just click the edit page. And we can hit think it's a Z normally I have it set to shift to Z. There is our cleaned up chin. And if you want to see that before, you can always hit this button up in the upper right to see the before. And there is our after. I want to say thank you for sticking through this whole tutorial about frequency separation and Mocha Pro. There are links for discounts for Mocha Pro down below. Obviously, the art list anytime you click on an Amazon link or BNH link, it helps the channel out and it helps support me to be able to to create stuff like this before my workday to help you become a better editor or compositor. I wish you all the best and I hope you have a happy new year.
