There's a common myth out there that a 24mm lens has less compression than a 70mm lens. Like people want longer lenses because they have better compression. And really it has everything to do with the distance of the camera to the subject. And what I'm talking about when I'm talking about compression, I'm talking about the appearance of how big the background is to the foreground. It's actually exactly the same between these two images. So I'm going to show you how you can use a little bit of simple math here in DaVinciers All Fusion and a transform tool to match them up which is going to help you with compositing. So you can take any image, background, foreground and get them in the right ballpark pretty quickly. So to match a 24mm plate to a 70mm plate, all you got to do is some math. We're going to divide one by the other. And this just depends if you need to scale it up or down. But the cool thing about Fusion, to meet your resolve when you add a transform, let's do XF to add a transform, it accepts these decimal point values so you can get really accurate results. So to get this 24mm, which is right here, loaded in my B buffer, get that scaled up, let's get the transform over there. We just enter that by, so 70 divided by 24 is 2.91666 and we're going to be 2.91666. And what that's just done is it made the exact same size so that these two can be composited together in any way. So you can see how this would work with any sort of background as long as you can get that metadata information of what the focal length is. And you do that division, you're going to be in a great starting point so that things will match. Now, if you want to compare this side by side with the 70mm, sure I can flick it up there in the B buffer. But even better, we have this little split here. So if I load my A buffer and I put the 70mm in there and then look at this, we also have buffer split, wipe, whatever you want to call it. We can compare these very closely with each other. That's also the button that's right next to shift on the keyboard so you can kind of compare the two. And look, the compression is actually exactly the same between them because the camera's in the same position to the subject. So now you know it has nothing to do with it. You don't have to go get a fancy long lens to get more compression. Now, there's obviously other reasons you get a long lens. It's nice. But basically this lets us line up different plates together really easily. And this works in the other direction as well. So let's do that next. I'm going to just go back to my A buffer only. And so let's say this transform, we want to take the wide angle is going to be our main plate. Well, you just divided the other way around. So we have 24mm divided by 70mm gives you .3429. Let's change this value here. .3429. Very precise number. And we'll attach the 70mm shot into the transform. But that's as soon as this pulled it out to the exact value that should match these two. So we're looking at the A buffer now. Let's switch to the B buffer, doing that with the period. And let's load the 24mm shot in there. And we're using the slash key to compare the two. Zooming in here. And now we've basically taken the 70mm shot and scaled it down. I have issues with my hands today. And those match as well. So you can obviously you can scale down, scale up. In this instance, you see less of the noise and stuff if you're scaling down. But it all depends on your final result. This is how you match two different plates that are shot with different focal lengths. So if you can find that metadata somewhere in the file, that's really helpful. Now the one other thing I do need to point out and is worth knowing is if the cameras are shot from with a different sensor size, there's a little bit of other math that you need to be aware of because you need to account for different sensor size in combination with the focal length. And I've pasted that right here. I don't want to make this tutorial go on too long because no one likes long tutorials. But you basically are counting for the difference in sensor size and millimeters along with the focal length so that you can get the correct transform. But that's all you got to do.
