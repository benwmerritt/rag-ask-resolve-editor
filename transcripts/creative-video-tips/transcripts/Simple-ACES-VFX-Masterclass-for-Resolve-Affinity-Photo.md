## Transcript
Today, I'd like to come right alongside you to teach you a high-end logo removal workflow for the studio version of DaVinci Resolve 19. You're going to learn how to convert raw footage plates to linear ASUS CG EXR sequences for compositing back infusion and how to even work with image sequences in Resolve to begin with. We've done a perfect round trip, not adjusting anything else. You'll learn where to download and install the OCIO viewlet so you can properly view your ASUS CG infusion, the round trip affinity photo ASUS workflow so you can non-destructively paint a clean plate, how to use the built-in planar tracker for match moving the cleaned up patch, how to match the grain by using a Denoise plate and a free plugin you can get from Fusion Reactor, and finally, how do we render this comp out? What are the best pro settings so that it'll play back in just about any timeline? Hey, if you decide that you want to follow along with me, I have provided the raw footage available to download at CreativeVideoTips.com by joining the cutting club. And I would just want to say thank you so much to those of you that have already joined. So the task is to remove this logo off of the backpack. Now it doesn't look like this is going to be a super difficult one. The light doesn't change a lot. It's not too, there's not a ton of movement in it, but I just want to show you the workflow that's involved converting this to ASUS CG so it can be used in affinity photo, brought back infusion, or used in any other app. Now, anytime I'm working on a VFX shot, the first thing I want to take a look at is the name of the shot, the name of the clip. And in Resolve, if you select the clip and go up here to the inspector and the file tab, you can see this is Blackmagic Raw. We want to change the name of this because we might have multiple shots from the same original clip. So if you click on this name down here, we'll change this to SH010 underscore because it'd be like shot one, I always start with 10, or work in increments of 10. And then the end of it might be called set of braw underscore l1. And if I click, you'll see that it's changed down here. And this can be used as a clip name token is what it's called on the deliver page. The first thing we'll do is make the conversion to ASUS from Blackmagic Raw. We'll do that on the color page. And the color page has this handy ASUS transform, you just click and drag it onto a node, we're going to use ASUS 1.3. And the input transform is the important thing to know about the import transform is what shot the thing, right? So if you can figure out what camera shot the footage, you just enter that right here. So this was a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4k. So I'll choose Blackmagic Film Gen 5. And the output is going to be ASUS CG. So I just need to find this in the list. And once you do this once, you can save this so you can reuse these later on. Gamut compression will be reference, Gamut Compress. And you'll see, if you're unfamiliar with working with linear, which is what you should be using for compositing, it makes the image dark. That's okay, we're not actually losing any detail here in these, in these dark shadow regions where we're retaining all of that, especially when we use a format like EXRs. So when we come to the deliver page to render this ASUS shot out, what we want to take a look at up here at the top level, the video section, it's set to single clip usually by default. And what that means is it'll take your entire timeline from beginning to end and make it into one single clip. But we don't want it to be one single clip, we wanted to use individual clips because we could actually have a timeline that's set up where we export a bunch of these in a row. So it could be like shot one, shot two, shot three. And each of these can get their own independent source resolution and timecode so that they relink throughout the whole post production process. Now choose custom export up here, and we're going to build our own custom export that you can save and reuse later on. You can also download this in the cutting club download files for for this project. So under format, we're not going to be using QuickTime, we're going to be choosing EXR, because this will work in floating point. So choose EXR, and the codec we don't want to choose RGB half instead what we want to be choosing is or what I like to choose is RGB half DWAB. Now DWAB is Dreamworks Animation codec at the default compression levels 45 is good. And this is going to save you a lot of extra file space over the default in here. RLE is another popular one, zip is another one. But this gets the files down to something that's more like ProS4444. And it's great for pretty much anything that I work on. We're going to next down here, we're going to choose, we've got individual clubs, we're going to choose render at source resolution. That's important. But that's not all. Okay, when you choose render at source resolution, you also need to really pay attention under the advanced settings down here to a couple of their things. And that's down here in this section. And the important one I want to point out is disable sizing and blanking output. Because anytime you do conforms, you usually have some sort of sizing information. That's from the inspector, the zoom position stuff. If you if you don't zero these out beforehand, which you don't need to. Or if you have blanking, right, so time out blanking, which is like letterboxing top and bottom, it bakes that in, even though you may have chosen render at source resolution. So in my mind, anytime you use render at source resolution, you pretty much always also want to have this box, which is not checked by default for disable sizing and blanking output. The others here force the Bayer to highest quality, that's kind of obvious. Just make sure you get this best quality out of the image. And enable flat pass I have that turned off. Basically, just says, hey, we are going to take the ASUS transform from the color page, anything you did there. And then below that, we have frame handles. So what a frame handle is, is it's basically, it's extra frames. So the extra frames allow for re editing later on. And what that would mean if we turn this up to 10, which is my suggested default to VFX standard is 10 frames on this side of the shot, 10 frames on that side of the shot, so it can easily be re edited later on. And in fact, for VFX, it's important to render with handles, because a lot of times you have motion blur that you're incorporating, and you need that to be already active on the first frame of when you're working. Now we can skip the audio tab, because this is going to be a folder full of pictures. But on the file tab, we have some thing different that you might not have used before. And that's tokens. Tokens are basically metadata that can be driven from anything else within resolve. But the one we're interested in is what is called clip name. So the file name currently is set to custom name, which is good. By the way, if you did dailies, that's when you would choose source name, we're doing individual VFX shots, we're using custom name. And the custom name is going to be the clip name. So just select the custom name field there, type percentage, so that's shift five, clip space name, return. And what that clip name refers to is on the edit page, whatever is on the edit page, this name down here, so we call this shot 10, which is shot one, layer one, which again, we assign from the file area over here, it will take this name and assign it to the file name on disk on render. So on the deliver page, a couple other short things here that I like to do. I like three digits in my file name, because I don't work with, you know, shots longer that that need would need that. And then the other thing is the render clip starts at zero. That's just a fusion thing, all fusion comps started at zero, when they're in resolve fusion, so that just makes things easier. And now because this is an image sequence, all the images that makes need to go into a specific folder. So when we take our look at our location here, when we're building these out, we want to choose browse, just pick a single shot folder, I'm going to put all my plates for this shot in this backpack affinity folder. And if I just put it all in there, they would just go directly in there, but we can go a little bit further by getting an automatically generated folder based off the clip token, right? So what I'll do is go to the end of that string there, hit the slash key, and then again, percentage line, clip name. And by doing it like this, you see that it's at the end of the location we're going to go, it will automatically draw the folder name that matches the clip name that's inside of it. Super, super cool technique. Now that this is all set up, you know, we've got all our settings are good to go. There's the video settings, or there was the file settings, here are the video settings, we can go over here to say the three dot menu, say save as new preset, we'll call this EXR demo. And we're happy with that. We've got a demo, we can use this again and again, add to render queue, render all. If I take a look at that folder on my hard drive, let's go to here, we'll go to Fusion Fridays backpack affinity, it automatically created a folder, and it's writing out all those EXR sequences in there, 56 items, command I, they're about six megabytes a piece, not too bad. And that's much smaller than they'd be if we had chosen the defaults of zip or RLE compression. So now that is our main plate. But the thing is, is this plate here actually has a lot of noise in it. So the other plate that is a very common thing to do for VFX is to create a de noise plate. So here's how I would do that. I'm going to hold option and shift on the clip that's on the timeline. There just makes a straight up copy. And this one, I'm going to rename over here instead of L one, I'm going to underscore DN for de noise. And then because I just want to render and work on this one plate that I'm getting ready to send out, I'm going to turn that off with D, go to the color page, we're going to use this is where resolve studio really comes in here in version 19. Because we're going to be using the noise reduction that's built in and that's not in the free version. It's actually the reason I first bought resolve many, many years ago was because of this noise reduction. So if you're over here and any of these other tabs, it's this guy right here, I get you to noise reduction. And we need to add two serial nodes one for the noise reduction and one more option s. So we can actually really see what the noise reduction is doing because it's really hard to see anything in linear when we're looking over here. So this other one, what I'm going to do is actually just drag another aces transform on here and say we're going to go this time from aces CG. And again, I would save these so that you can just paste them on later from a power bin. But this is aces CG to rec 709, which would be typically at the end of your pipeline. And this is just so that we can sandwich this is an aces sandwich on both sides. So we can do our noise reduction in the middle and still sort of see you can see that grain, we're going to try to get rid of that with some noise reduction. So with number two selected right in the middle, I'm going to go down here to temporal noise reduction, maybe it changes to like three frames now temporal is basically using the frames left and right to try to clean up and get rid of that noise. And it doesn't do anything to turn it up, but it doesn't need much because the ISO was like 200, this is outside. So that was probably about enough actually just maybe four. Now the way you can kind of see how much noise reduction you're doing is if you click on this highlight window. And then there's some if it's on these other buttons choose the AB one, and you can kind of see how much you're removing. If it's too much, you can see start getting all that detail that means you're actually losing too much detail. So that's obviously that would be way too much. So I'm going to turn this off just so I can zoom into the part that I really care about when we're going to be sampling the noise, which is going to be this region over here, hit the the AB window again, and we'll start to turn this up until we start to see something happen. Let's just call it four on YouTube, it might be hard to see how much noise is being removed. But the idea is we remove the noise so that when you do paint clean up, there's not static frozen noise on the still frame. Alright, so I think we got enough of the noise removed so that we'll be able to do paint clean up good and I'll be staring at frozen noise. But we do want to disable this. We don't need this node here, we don't want to taking this back to 709. So delete that that was just so I could see my own eyeballs here, and to render out the D noise plate because we can rename this on the timeline under the file inspector area called this DN at the end go to the deliver page it's going to take the token clip name so we don't really have to change anything else it's in fact going to dump this right into the folder for that shot we'll hit add to render queue start to render and the D noise plate gets dumped out in a folder is created automatically for it right there and we can take a look at the file size differences if you're curious command I command I and the D noise one is a little bit smaller which makes sense there's not as much detail hey real quick in case you're wondering why should I even use aces cg to begin with well one it's open source so it works across a lot of apps and then two it gives you like a standard in case you have a shoot that uses lots of different camera formats to sort of unify everything so that you can have predictable results every time and it maintains all the dynamic range of the original camera footage as well so there's so many benefits once you get your head around this I think is going to really change your workflow to get these back into resolve to start compositing there's a little trick that I like to do and that's in the media pool is first create a bin for your plates just have it open and you can just drag folders straight to a timeline from the finder in case you didn't know that so it's kind of a neat neat little hack instead of having to do this whole special you know import process so I would just take the l1 sequence of shots here just grab the folder straight down to a timeline and you can do that with the denoise plate as well and those are important you can see over here the image sequences are loaded in fact if you turn on your timecode which is right over here show timecode overlays the sequences retain full timecode so these will work with any sort of vfx round trip workflow if this is all you get from this whole tutorial now you know how to make aces cg plates for someone that's working in nuke or flame or something else and they have all the handles available to work on them so we've got both our denoise plate and our main plate that are down here on the timeline let's get into fusion and take a look at these we don't actually need the denoise plate we're just going to work on the one below it so if you just turn it off and then you click fusion it'll take whatever the highest one that's visible so click fusion and the image is still dark and the reason why is this image is linear and we need to have a view lot that converts it for us to look normal and if you click this button right up here this is your view lots button and you want to choose the ocio display view let click edit and then basically what this is asking for is a specific file on your hard drive you need to go get this from the internet and i was always wondering how the heck do i know which one to pick i'm going to walk you through that right now so the link will be down in the description on how to get to this website right here this is the open color i o config asus page and all you need to do on here navigate to the releases tab over here on the right okay click on releases and that'll bring you to all the the versions that are out there and if you scroll down the one i actually want to use is not the most current one because it's not supported in affinity photo at least as of now this is getting into the fall of 2024 one you want to choose the current one is this right here which is um 2.3 we want to actually be using the 2.2 version of studio so that'll have all the camera configs in it so just click that and as soon as you do it loads it into your downloads folder and it's just this tiny 69 kilobyte file and all you need to do is place this in a location on your computer that is easy to be referenced you know by fusion and affinity so that it can apply a viewing lot for you right this little tiny files all you need you don't need a big bucket of lots or anything like that so i'll just take that command see i'll place it in my resolve aces folder which is where i like to keep my config file and then on the viewer over here you can see i have a config file location you say browse and you point it to the location of that config that ocio file and then you're going to be changing a couple things here the source space is going to be aces cg now this is saying what kind of footage is on are you loading to me we made aces cg files and what is your display so what is the what are you looking at on the computer monitor i'm looking at the srgb display and it does the transform all that for you you don't really need to touch the rest of that but it does have these cool gain uh sliders here so you can really match level so you can see if i bring this up we haven't lost any data there in those dark areas i know you were probably concerned hey we totally crushed the image note all of that detail that was existing before is still there the other thing to know here is you can save this as a default in a couple ways so one of them is if you right click on the name you can say settings save default so that next time you come into fusion that'll be your default and the other thing too is about this whole viewer being set as a default as well so if you right click anywhere in this area you can go to settings save defaults and i like to do this with this three dot menu here with a couple options that are not the default so smooth right resize i like that turned off what that means is when i zoom in really close on a pixel or something i can see the pixel you can see see that there if you turn this to being on it just makes it a blurry mess and it makes it kind of hard to do detail work that i like to do so i'll leave that off and the other one i like to leave off is the checker underlay so that means if i have any sort of cutouts of transparency it just it goes black underneath instead of doing that checker board that some people like it's just harder to see detail work when that's on so the way you get that so it loads every time it's again it's a right click settings save defaults so now that we can see everything fine let's do one more thing let's pull in our denoised plate we can just get that from the media pool but sometimes our media pool is full of lots of stuff so a little trick that i like to do to find something in the media pool is if i have it on the edit page ready to go if i select it i hit option f which is going to be find in media pool that loads it in my media pool and whatever selected here as soon as i go to a fusion it'll still be selected in the media pool over here right so if i expand this you can see the plate that it had selected there is going to be the denoised one so i'll just drag the denoised clip over here and so i have both available as as plates in fusion it's also a good idea to rename clips when they look the same especially denoised plates so f2 will rename i'll hit f2 and i'll just call it media2 that's fine i like to leave the original name the same and then just underscore dn let's me know that's the denoised plate and i don't need to do the main plate i can understand what that is click the media tab to make that go away and if you want to load two side by side a lot of compositing is comparing we're now loaded in our a buffer and then if we want to go to our b buffer again it's going to be the comma period and slash keys on the keyboard nothing is in that b buffer now we can put our denoised plate in there and if you want to go up here to buffer split wipe this lets you see both sides so if i zoom in close we should be able to see a difference between the denoised and the original plate you know what make this easier to see is if you turn on the edit for display let and just gain up quite a bit then we should really be able to see the two oh you know what i did i loaded the media in two on both of them that's why they were looking to say i was confused so media in one is on the a side and the denoised on the left side now you can really see the difference between the grainy version and the cleaned up version and this will be great because we can use a tool from uh milo labs to re-grain this patch once we clean it up in affinity in case another compositor comes in they might want to know what frame you froze so the way you can free stuff right here in resolve shift space uh time speed is one of the tools that can do that really well load time speed over there turn the speed down to zero in the inspector and the delay is going to be the frame number that you're you want to see so i want to see 30 i want to freeze frame 30 so delay is going to be set to 30 and just like that this is frame 30 so that'll be our reference frame that we're going to be cleaning up in affinity photo i'm going to rename it with f2 time speed underscore fr 30 just so we have that reference available and then with this loaded over here you can right click and export this now we have a view lot turned on for both of these just because we have that gained up does not affect the image underneath i want to make that sure that that's clear so i could have left that up you could turn it off but that's really just for checking things to export an exr single image from fusion you just right click on it and you say save image and then you give it a name so we'll just call this one backpack and um denoise something like that is fine uh v1 you know it's good idea to have version stuff so this is our denoise plate that will get cleaned up and let's place it in our resolve fusion fridays folder backpack affinity and we'll call this one affinity you know whatever your organization is fine but you want to put the extension on it dot exr return now we get the fun of opening up affinity photo and then right click to say open with not photoshop we don't want you we want affinity photo affinity photo too and we're opening it up and look at that it actually looks pretty normal and the reason why is i actually already have my otio view lot loaded into affinity so how do you how where do you get that from well it's the exact same file we used in resolve remember in resolve we got from uh this uh github page here that 2.2 view lot um that's what affinity is using in the place you load it in here on a mac it's under the affinity tab on a windows machine it's under the edit tab but basically you want to go to your settings and then the color tab of settings down here to open color i o configuration file and you point it to that exact location so you say select you go to i mean it mine was already loaded but you just choose the file the ocio file say open and then on a mac you do also need to give it permission it's some sandboxing deal to have permission to that folder so you just give it permission to the folder that it's in and this is a this is a key thing here do not have these boxes checked is what i found uncheck perform ocio conversions based on file name and then you obviously you don't need the warning for it so make sure you uncheck that that's a key thing uh hit close and it's going to ask you when you change your ocio folder it's going to ask you to restart oh and a quick way to monitor if you're actually using the ocio view transform in affinity photo two is go up to the window menu up here and then down to 32 bit preview and down in the lower right you'll see that you're using the ocio view transform with whatever version of asus and then the right box here this little pop up here is going to say what display are you using is your monitor calibrated to s r gb like most of us probably is just choose that and that that way you can make sure you're not using the icc transform that's built into the computer's operating system instead you're using the the ocio config file real quick affinity photo tutorial i'm going to hit command shift s to save this as an affinity photo file it's kind of like a psd just so i can have a layered element to come back to later and i'm going to remove this um this white alpha channel over there i'm going to use z to sort of zoom in spacebar to move around here and to remove this i'm going to work on a new layer so new layer button down there and over here we have a lot of the same tools you're used to from photoshop even j is the shortcut to get to these i'm going to use the patch tool the thing that gets most people is one up at the top current layer is not what i want because i'm working on a new transparent layer i want to change this to current layer and below so it can work on the layer below and then also make sure you have the layer selected over here because if you don't when you draw nothing's going to happen i'm going to zoom out just a little bit and you just kind of draw with your cursor around the arrow it's kind of like a lasso tool that you want to be removing so if i just sort of draw around there and then you can take your as soon as you move your cursor it's trying to choose a place to use to fill and blend it in and it's trying to do like frequency separation so if i click once and click it again it tries to smooth it all out and it did a pretty good job from the start so if i turn it on and off but i can still kind of see those edges there so you just do a little bit of cleanup on top of that so on this one i would say healing brush is a good option and healing brush will just let me to it's like a clone sort of you option click an area and then you can sort of paste um just color information and sort of leave texture so you know again this is not a huge tutorial on affinity photo but i just want to show you you can quickly use uh still photo techniques to paint something out and the other thing that's nice about this i'm going to hit command one to go full screen and turn that back on is now i've isolated my paint work to just this area right here just so that i'm only replacing this part of my composite back on to the graphic over there which is going to keep the most original bits of the shot intact right so i'm going to go to file uh export and once we choose export make sure to choose exr so we're going to keep this a completely non-destructive round trip and when you choose that you want to go down here and choose a couple other things um for compression i've been using zip out of these on my still plates i know it's it's a bigger file than the dwab but this is just one still clean plate that i'm making and as far as the pixels i'm going to do 16 bit half float which makes a little bit smaller but the key thing here there's another checkbox you need to make sure you uncheck and that is color profile from name uncheck that so it's not doing anything crazy to the the um the color and it does a completely perfect round trip so that was two places you need to make sure you uncheck the color profile from name the other one was in the settings when you initially you know turned on your ocio we'll hit export and where we're going to put it let's put it right next to uh the um the others so fusion friday affinity photo affinity and we'll just keep it right here and then the name of this one will be um patch v1 i don't know something like that so we have the patch click and drag and it loads a new media in and you can see we have a little patch here and we just need this to match now the first thing you'll look at is we got these jaggies anytime you see jaggies is what i like to call them that means the alpha channel has not been multiplied yet it's an unpre multiplied alpha channel you can see this may be better if i change this here to check our underlay you can see is really hard jaggies on there so what i need to do is actually um pre multiply this so the way the way you do that there's a node infusion called shift space multiply there's a lot of ways to do it but this just multiplies the alpha channel so now we have a nice gradient so this will blend nicely into the original plates then change this back here to check our underlay off so it's black again if you just kind of want to see how well this actually looks and just see that it's not destructive i guess we can do that first by merging our patch on top of our frozen clean play and then pick and flick our merge over there you can see we seem to have done a pretty nice job right so before could be a and then period for after could be the merge and then the one next to it slash on the keyboard is our little wipe you can see we've gotten rid of it but it's not moving yet so the next piece of the puzzle is going to be doing tracking so to track the movement in this shot we're going to use the planar tracker just the default planar tracker and we'll use the match move setting on it so shift space type in p l a n a p track is what it's called and that will automatically connect to whatever it you know whatever comes after so if you're still new to nodes and stuff that's not a problem if it wherever you click let's say it wasn't pre-selected wherever you click is a way to say hey i want that node to live there so i'm gonna hit shift space and i'll just show that again it drops it right where i clicked and if you want to insert this in here be instead of having to do this wiring and all that if you just hold down shift and bring it down to the bottom anywhere along here till it turns blue and yellow it inserts it and it'll always go into the background input with the planar tracker so that you can start drawing on it and make a reference frame and get tracking data so planar tracker is really simple to use it's hard to master but what you want to do is just drag a polygon around the thing you want to be tracking and it should be basically the same surface so basically what i'm doing is just coming around here now generally you don't want to be going outside the area that you want to be tracking so but in this case this is a very simple one i wouldn't worry about it too much i added an extra point there i'm gonna hit command z just make sure it's closed up as the main point and to get it working what you'll do is park it at a reference frame i like to park it at keep everything at the same reference frame that we worked from so this was remember we did frame 30 down here so i'm going to move to frame 30 oh those were off i didn't do that the right frame select them all by just dragging and then hold option lets you move all of that together and so you can sort of re-center it on the image um the once we have that set we're going to change our reference frame to being set to the frame we're on and that picks up that frame 30 there i'm going to change the tracker type to hybrid point area motion type is how you know count how how much motion is in it i always try with perspective first and if it's bad then i change it so we'll start with perspective track forward button and then we come back to where we tracked from which is frame 30 if you didn't want to drag there there's actually a shortcut you can just hit the go button and then track back from here and what it's doing it's giving us tracking data that's all relative to this reference frame that's why reference frames are so important here infusion anytime you're doing tracking i can't really tell how successful this track is this will lie to you a lot so the way you can actually check the quality of the track is was it any good is go to operation mode steady and as soon as you go to there what it's done is it's it's kind of locking off this whole area and i position my cursor over a point let's say we put it right on the center there and then i push play and if that point doesn't move as i'm playing back which it looks like it is pretty rock solid that means the track is good if at this point you do this and this is the this middle part is wobbling around meaning the part that the if i change the spec to track meaning that the points in this section inside this polygon are moving you got to retract and you need to probably lower your motion type because your results are not going to be good but this works for this case right here not a big deal pretty easy but how do we use this data one of the best ways of using the match move data when we have a clean plate already made this to use what's called the create planar transform function right here what this does essentially if i click it it'll make a node poops i don't know it over there and the the node is giving me information about our reference time and what that means is that reference time at frame 30 this is why reference is so important at frame 30 it takes the entire image like top you know left bottom left as if it were not moving at all and all the frames around it are going to apply movement to it so what it's basically what's the reference frame and you feed your image through the planar transform i hope that makes sense so what i want to be doing here is um i do not care about my patch going into a freeze frame anymore we're going to actually move this over so we have our patch from affinity photo and i'm going to merge this on top of the original footage here that has grain and noise and all that and you'll see how this works so if i go to frame 30 it doesn't really matter to park it before but it's just kind of cool to see when it happens then we'll add a merge node after here shift space and then merge shift space is your tool picker and then what we need to do is feed our clean plate that's been multiplied pre-multiplied going into the planar transform and then we're not we haven't done anything yet we need to merge this on top of the original footage and now when you push play to preview it this patch is getting matchmood based off of that frame 30 oh and one more quick thing to pay attention to is because this patch is moving and it's a frozen frame it needs motion blur so anything that moves things in fusion has a motion blur checkbox if i click the planar transform over here go to the settings tab and we have a checkbox for motion blur turn that on i like to crank that up to 10 and it's a very subtle thing but what will happen is any sort of detail pixels in here will get motion blur as the image is moving and so that's going to sell your patch a lot better we're almost done we're getting close but if you come in here closer and then let's turn on our exposure so we can see better let's turn that up quite a bit so anytime you use a still image software to clean something up you're going to need to add noise back you can take a look here as i increase the exposure this sticks out like a sore thumb we need to apply the grain so yes you can just re-grain with the tools that are right here in fusion but this re-grain tool that i'm going to show you is available on fusion reactor that's this website then i'll point to right here i'll leave the link down below it tells you how to install it totally free really great stuff in there and once you get it installed you'll go down to console scripts reactor and load reactor the the tool i want to show you if i hit shift space is called re-grain by milo labs the way this thing will work is i'm going to feed it the original footage which is this media in one right here and right click on a note it kind of gives you specifics of where you're dropping it this is going to go into the background that's where the original footage goes then it also wants the denoise plate so this is another use why we created the denoise plate as well as we're going to take this in here as well i'm going to hold control just so i can target specifically where i want this to go i want this to go into the deno the denoised input okay and then the next thing you need to do is move and pick a reference frame for the noise print to try to calculate everything so with a re-grain loaded up in the window here because i've got stuff in there what you want to do is move the this little box to pick an area to sample that doesn't have a lot of texture now an ideal thing would be like a sky this image here everything in it has texture so it's going to be kind of a crapshoot but right here let's pretend that this part of the bag wasn't supposed to have too much texture we can place it there and then you can choose a frame to park it on why don't we just use frame 30 because we did that as a reference for every other frame you go to over here reference frame type in 30 return make sure your color space is set to linear which i think is the default since we're using asus cg so it's linear light it's the way to composite it's the way of the future let's get the plate mixed in there i'm going to go to the planar transform and the planar transform right now has just our moving patch and that's what i actually want to be regraining so i will be taking this instead of it getting merged right now i'll remove that i'll take the output of the planar transform and i'll be dropping that into that pink input so let me do that again right click pink input that's the comp input okay the comp input here basically means our cutout patch load that up over here do our split wipe one more time um the only thing to pay attention to is when i do that without a mask i'm actually regraining everything and i don't need to be doing that i just want to be doing the patch so the regrain tool itself has a mask input so if i right click on the output of the planar transform which moves it i can drop this into the effect mask and then we can load that over into the right viewer and then to actually multiply the mask out make the cutout from it go to settings multiply by mask and now you can see what i'm doing so now i'm just applying grain to that cutout region right um it's not comped over yet i'm just trying to get it there to match the grain levels they have a regrained result i'm going to disconnect our media out because i don't need that anymore move our original plates over here we're going to merge our patch over the top of the original plate shift space merge original plate comes down here move this off to the side so you can see better and then the output of the regrain effect that i got from reactor going into the foreground of merge and we have a patch that has animated noise on it so that it sort of fits into the scene now to get this to the timeline you need to always make sure you have a media out connected so that will get us back to the timeline so there we go we've got a patch in there it's following with the planar transform that we had done with the planar tracker we've uh multiplied the alpha channel from our patch from affinity photo we've kept it fully in asus cg the entire time but this was an easy example because the lighting doesn't change a lot so if the lighting changes a lot you might need to use two or three patches and blend them with a merge over time or use my trick that i use to animate the lighting changes with a series of brightness contrast notes which you can find in the tutorial i have about the cleaning up the back of a bus like a tourist bus and now to render this whole compound so it'll play back on just about any computer we're going to first go to the edit page to rename this so we can give it a comp name version so select the clip go to your inspector down to the name area at the end over here i'm just going to remove everything until where it says the clip number we'll call this comp version one click to lock that in we've renamed it down there so when you go to the deliver page you can use your exr preset that you had made the dwa half you know setting we'll say add to render queue actually don't hit add to render queue next pay attention right here our in and out points are selecting multiple clips and i if i just want to render this one mark it in on the timeline so it'll restrict it to that area add to render queue render and it automatically creates a folder on disk called comp one and the shot sequence in there itself is is getting labeled as it's cooking out and this is one really cool thing about using sequences is if you actually use fusion studio you can distribute these so that one computer is rendering one frame one's rendering the other one and it's actually if you have resolve studio means you have fusion studio this is all built in for free like as long as you share the same storage you can have your own render farm for basically nothing to color this this is still an asus cg so you probably a colors might want to put this into asus cct or asus c whatever it is instead of asus cg for grading so you would change this here from asus cg to asus cc t and now we're back into log world with a clip that has been cleaned up so the classic asus sandwich that you probably see taught all over youtube right now option s is to go from here to work in this little area between here between asus cct and on the second one will go from asus cct which is the asus log format out to good old rec 709 right i missed i passed it and so you see we get nice smooth playback we've got noise and grain added in there and you have all this flexibility of floating point right in between we've done a perfect round trip not adjusting anything else other than cleaning up and removing that logo so if i choose this x marks the spot i've got it set to loop it's gone just like that that's the full enchilada i hope you learned something new today my name is actually chatwick and if you're new here this is your first time i'm so glad that you enjoyed this tutorial and stuck around this long i have a website called creative video tips i would love for you to connect with me on there so i get an email and then i can reply to you personally and because there's so much more to learn i'll see you in the next video
