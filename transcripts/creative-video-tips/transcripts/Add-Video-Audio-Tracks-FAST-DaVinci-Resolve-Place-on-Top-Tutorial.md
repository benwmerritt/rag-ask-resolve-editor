DaVinci Resolve has 7 main edit commands, but one of them doesn't clearly describe how useful it could be for adding audio clips on a timeline. It's not just for B-Roller graphics. So in today's quick DaVinci Resolve tutorial, we're going to take a look at Place on Top and why it's not always just for placing on top because sometimes the bottom is just as useful. Let's get into it. If you're coming from editing in Final Cut Pro, Place on Top is kind of like a connected clip. You can automatically drop clips onto the first empty track above and below the clips that you already have in your timeline, regardless of where you have your target track destination patches set to. This will actually create a new track automatically for you, if you don't have that empty track there. That's what's subede of this. So to show you how Place on Top is so awesome, we've got a timeline here that needs a letter box and it needs a Cinemascope 235 matte added to it. And we can see we've got video one, video two. There is no video three created yet. Well, we don't actually need to create that. This is going to do it for us. To drop it on the timeline, I'm going to go to the first frame with home, mark it in with my I key, go to the end with the end key, hit O. That marks the entire timeline for us. So that's important to get sort of precision, three point editing going. And I'm going to click this 235 Cinemascope matte that I have over here in my bin and just hit F12. And just like that, we can see it automatically created a V3 track for us and it has nicely gone. We make that a little bigger on top of all the footage below it. So that's a great way to place on top with the graphic. You can even do that with a title. So let's say we want to put a title on this shot right here. I mark X instead of I know that's just a faster way of marking automatically marking the beginning and end is X. And let's put a title on top. The way we get to our titles is under effects library and then choose our text right here. And then we can just click and drag straight from here instead of hitting F12 and say place on top. So that's one of the seven commands hit place on top. It has restricted it to the in and out points that we had marked on our timeline. So that's why I'd mark those first. If you didn't do that, it feels kind of random, the placement and how long that is. And then you have to end up trimming it later on. So I always like to mark the in and out on the timeline first. So that's place on top with video tracks, which I think a lot of people know about that. But what I was was new to me is that this actually places under as well with audio tracks. So this video is basically it's finished. And I've got a mix that I need to drop onto the timeline. We can see we've got nine audio tracks and they're they're all being used right now. So I need a 10 I need it stereo and I need to get that mixed down there fast. So the way I'm going to do that is take my play head to the beginning again with hitting the home key. And I'm going to go grab that mix that I had just gotten back. Let's see, I guess let's go to the mix bin right there. We'll double click to load it into our source and it is right at the first frame of there. All I need to do, even though this is patched to a one, it's going to create a new track for us with using place on top and it's going to place on bottom. Watch this F12. Boom, just like that. It placed my mix the exact location spot I needed to base off of the beginning of the play head. And I've got my mix down there. It's ready to go. All I would need to do is hit the solo button and I could bounce this out and export it for, you know, for wherever I need to deliver it to. So place on top. It's not just for graphics. You could also do this for music. So I don't know if you understand the power of this is really, really great. So let's say you had lots of music tracks that you wanted to try out. You could just keep hitting F12. It'll create the new tracks in the correct format. So this is stereo because the original source was stereo. If it was mono, it would have created a mono track for me. You could see the powerful way that you could work with this without having to deal with clicking and dragging and being sort of approximate with your locations. You can mark things within and out. Really, really great place on top. For the bonus tip today, I want to show you cleanup video tracks. And what this is going to do is going to take a messy timeline like this one right here where we've got all this empty space that's unused. It's wasted tracks. We've got nine video tracks. We don't need that. So this will simplify things for when we go to finishing so that we're not dealing with such a mess. Go to timeline and then under timeline, you're going to go down to cleanup video tracks and then flatten unused clips. And by just clicking this, it's going to smash everything down to just the tracks that it needs to show what's already on the timeline. We'll hit flatten unused clips and just like that, the cleanup of video tracks was completed successfully and everyone's happy and everything is much, much easier to deal with when we move to further stages of effects and color correction and whatnot. We're not dealing with so many different layers. Hey, thank you so much.
