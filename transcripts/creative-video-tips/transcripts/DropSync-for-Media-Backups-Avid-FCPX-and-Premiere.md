What's up guys, it's Chadwick here. Wanted to give you a quick tip about syncing up two hard drives like on a nightly basis from an editor drive to an assistant drive with the Avid Media files. This is a lot easier than syncing stuff, you know, by looking at date modified and then just copying those files because it does all the work for you. What you need to get is a drop sync. It's on the App Store and LuckyMe, I have it installed already. So let's go ahead and open up the application and we need to first create a new synced place. So go to synced places, new. And what I want to do is take stuff that's on this BioShock volume and move it onto the Spartan volume. We'll call it Avid Media BioShock to Spartan because those are the names of the hard drives, right? And right here you see we've got a new synced place. On the left we've got our source drive, the right is like a destination drive. Now they can go back and forth. These buttons will let you go back and forth. But just to think like an editor, here's our source monitor, here's our record monitor. Let's start by setting up our record monitor. So down here on Spartan, we don't have a folder for Avid Media files, so let's do that first. Let's make one. So we've got a new folder, call it Avid Media files. Spelled exactly how they like it with no space between media and files. We'll take this, drag it up here and we can see our route path for this is volume, Spartan, Avid Media files, right at the route where we want it. And next we're going to go over here to the source side and choose the directory that we want to sync. We're going to sync the Bioshock Avid Media files folder and I'll click open. Now at first it looks like it doesn't work and it doesn't at first. It says users chat with Shultz which is not the path I want to sync. So if I did these right here, this is not going to work out right. What we have to do is click this set as route button and then boom, these match up. So we have volumes, Bioshock, Avid Media files and over here we have volumes, Spartan, Avid Media files. So essentially what this will do is take everything that's in here and make it everything in here. Now what's so great about this application is that it's going to see what's different between those folders and just offer to add or delete what's different about them so that when you're going on in a project and you've only added a couple pieces of voiceover or a couple new video clips per day, you're able to just copy the delta, the changes from that day rather than either making a massive copy of the whole new project or having to search by date and doing things manually which is never fun. So jumping back over here to Dropsync, we first probably should save it. So we've got a file save and then if you look in here we'll see we're going to actually be selecting all of the sub folders within there which is what I want typically for a project. Then I will click Preview to the right and it's scanned through super fast and it's telling me that it's going to be wanting to move 51 gigs of files which is 609 changes. You can see the details, all the media that's in there that will be moved which is cool. And just click Proceed. It's pretty simple from here on out. So we've got progress bars being drawn. You can see a progress bar down here as well. Then also one thing you might notice is that we're looking at Spartan down here. It has already automatically started making the folder structure too. So it made the MXF folder, it made all these other folders in here. Now there's no files in there yet because I haven't copied them but they're there so they will be getting the MXF media in there as this progress goes by. Awesome, see the progress bar is done and if we check down here we'll see on Spartan that we have in our MXF media folders. We've got all the footage as it populates there that we did up above. We can double check that easily by going here and seeing there's 56 items in here, 56 in there. Just sort of spot checking. To a one folder we've got 71 and 71. And so to me this is a much better way of doing incremental updates per day. Is just going and plugging both drives into the same computer using this software and just proving the changes from one to the other. Now obviously because I didn't add any files there's nothing here but on a normal day if you added files to one of these and not the other it would see the differences and you could push those across easily. Now you see how easy you can sync up drives without having to manually go into and say go into list view and then sort by date modify which is never a fun way of doing stuff. So anyways take care and I'll talk to you next time.
