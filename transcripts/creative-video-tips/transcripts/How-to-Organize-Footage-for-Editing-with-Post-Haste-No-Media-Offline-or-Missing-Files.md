Have you ever been working on editing a project? You open it up a while later and you find tons of offline media and missing assets? Well today I'm going to show you how I organize my projects using folders and a tool called PostTaste so that doesn't happen again. Hey I'm Chadwick. This is Creative Video Tips where I help you create videos and make a difference in standout. If that's something you're into, click subscribe right now so you don't miss the next tip. Alright, today we're talking all about folder structures. I'm going to show you my full proof folder structure and organization method. So that you can open a project years down the road, wherever, whenever, and it's just going to work. Let's get into it. Okay, now the reason a lot of times your media may have gone offline is because it's moved from its original location. So whether it's Final Cut Pro, Avid Media Composer, Divigy Resolve, Adobe Premiere, all those project files just point to the media. The project file itself does not have media in it. So your folder structure is really important and the tool I use to organize my folders is great and it's free. It's called Digital Rebellion Makes It. So you go to digitalrebellion.com and the product is called PostTaste. So download PostTaste. Okay, I've got a Mac version, a PC version. Once you've done that, go ahead and open it. So I use Spotlight command, spacebar to open it. And then within PostTaste, it comes with some templates already built out. I'm going to show you mine here. I just called it Creative Video Tips and it's pretty in depth. But the point of this video is you have a place to put things so that they don't get left all about. So think about it in your house. If you don't have a spot to put away whatever it is, it gets left out and it leaves a mess. And if you do that with digital assets for video, you're going to not be able to open a project later because things are going to move over time as you delete and clean things out. So the way it works in PostTaste to draw folders out, once you've created a template, which is simple, you would just to create a template, you would just hit plus and say new template, whatever it is. And then on the right side, you've got, you know, you can create new folders or actual project files within here. I just use it for folders. And then it could be, you know, folder one, and then you can have folders inside of folders. I think you can figure that out pretty quickly by yourself. Now to create a new project, you go over here to the new project tab, you give a project a name, calling this YouTube tutorial, and then you say create project. And it's going to ask you where you want to put it. And a true YouTube demo tutorial, I'm going to put it on the desktop. So you save and it creates a project with all my folders that I had preset up in my template. And it's all dated and timestamped the folder creation of when you did that. That's really helpful. So here's how I use all those folders. It looks like a lot, but there's actual use and rhyme and reason to it. And I jump over here quickly to a project that I just finished. So this is a 34 minute long show film that I cut together. And you can see it's a beast, right? There is over one terabyte of assets that are in this thing. And it's all contained within one project folder. So that's that's one of the keys here to this whole thing is you're going to take one single folder, all your project files, all your media, all your assets are going to live in that one folder. And that makes it portable. So you can take that folder when you're done with the project, move it to another hard drive, move it to the cloud, give it to another editor, all of it stays together. And the video editing project stays linked to those assets. So the folders that I use, first of all, they are numbered 1234 because the Mac finder is alphanumeric. And I want project files always to be at the top, just a muscle memory thing. So I know it's in the right same spot every time. Project files are going to be your AEP files. Colors going to be your DaVinci Resolve project files. And yes, you'll have multiples, especially if you're backing up as you go. Edit, this is your, this is your bread and butter, right? So this is this right here is an avid media composer project file with all my bins. You can have a Final Cut Pro project file, Premiere, whatever it is, that's where that's going to live. And then this one also has a Pro Tools session as well with all those session files. So number two is assets assets. This is going to be the bulk of everything. If you do nothing other than in this video, create a template that has an assets folder and a project files folder. Me off doing pretty good. The reason I have us broken down further is just because projects I work on tend to have a lot of assets, and it just keeps things a little more tidy. So under assets, I have an animation VFX folder. These are things that come out of After Effects or out of Cinema 40 or, you know, any sort of app where I'm creating a motion graphic or there's a VFX plate or something that it's a generated file that's going to be added, but it's not coming off of a camera. We've got art cards. So this, these are things like, you know, here's a credits list. That's going to be things that are graphic related, PSDs, illustrator files, audio. We've got this all broken down by music, production sync, which is like they had dual system sound running, sound effects, voiceover. And then we've got an other folder, place to put your fonts. You want to make sure you have your fonts too. Just because you have them installed on your computer doesn't mean they're going to be installed on the next computer that opens that project. Photos and scripts. And then there's a Slates folder. I haven't used that in a while, but that's anytime I'm doing commercial work. And then a video folder. So video, this is stuff that comes off of the camera. So source our files directly from the camera. So those are that's your original media. And then you can have a proxy folder or a transcode folder. If you're going to do like a proxy workflow. So I've got a video I'll link up here right now. If you want to learn how to edit video a little smoother, especially on an underpowered computer, like honestly, everyone has an underpowered computer. If you're editing modern footage these days, that makes it easier. So there's a link to that. So that's a place right there where you can store your proxy files or your dailies is another term for those. Now under three is deliverables. So in my mind this you could also call this works in progress. This is going to be a series of dated folders that show you along the way, you know, your exports. And I usually do a dated folder system. That's really important. So you want to when you date things you always want to lead with the year. The reason you lead with the year is because at the end of a year like in December, you're going to be working on 12 dash whatever right and then you're going to keep working on in January and it's going to be one. And also in your story and gets all messed up. So make sure you begin with the year. And then keep your oldest stuff at the top, your newest stuff at the bottom, if that's sorted. And then that's, you know, you keep your works in progress in there. So these are like low res preview files you're uploading for the client prep is a folder if you're doing turnarounds. So basically meaning you're going to send your file out for professional mix, color correct, the effects work stuff like that. So these are going to be EDL files, reference files. If you don't know what it is, you probably don't need the folder for it. But having a spot for those is really helpful. Because that's a work in progress stage. Then finally we have a finals folder. Finals are anything you ship. So you might have a final version to master totally done really expert finished video folder. But I think what really works best in finals is if you date things, if you're going to have multiples just date it. And then within here I have a pro res HQ, which is a great master format to keep a final version of a video, and then a compressed one. So the compressed one would be like an H264 4k and 1080p version is what I've gotten here on this project here. So those are great to share out to Vimeo or YouTube. And that is pretty much my folder structure that I use. If you're to dumb it down you could have really just like a project files folder, an assets folder, and a finals folder. If you just had those three and always put those types of assets in it, it's going to save you a lot of headache. Hey, if you learned something from this video tip, click like and subscribe.
