Did you know that you could take a video clip from looking like this to this or this to this without using a LUT or doing any color grading? Today I've got some quick tips on how to use a Color Managed workflow using DaVinci Wide Gamut in DaVinci Resolve 17. Let's get to it. Color management is a way to remap footage from one color space, what the camera recorded, to another one, what the display can reproduce. And the magic comes from the middleman, the intermediate timeline color space doing some advanced math behind the scenes. It also makes matching different cameras from different sensors much easier because it understands like what a Sony camera considers to be the color green and what Canon considers to be green. So this evens the color science playing field and it's great for editors because it lets us focus on being creative once we turn it on. Speaking of turning it on, let's do that right now so you can see how easy it is. Go to your project settings with Shift and I,n go to color management, color science, change DaVinci YRGB to DaVinci YRGB Color Managed. Next change the preset below to DaVinci Wide Gamut. Wide Gamut is new in DaVinci Resolve 17 and will future proof any outputs you might need. I think of DaVinci Wide Gamut as kind of like a Photoshop smart object but for color. It gives you a very wide color space to work within. Leave the output color space at Rec 709, Gamut 2.4 or whatever your monitor display is and this setting can be changed at any time but will also control your rendered video output that's over on the deliver page. Hit option or alt on a PC to save those settings and bam! Just like that you'll see your color and contrast pop. You can go back to the old DaVinci YRGB, hit option save and you'll see the camera's original flat footage. Now let's go back to DaVinci YRGB Color Managed, save and dive a little deeper. DaVinci Resolve has four main ways to normalize high dynamic range log encoded footage to make it viewable. This video focuses on Resolve Color Management which is similar to ASIS but that's for another video. Then there's the color space transform effect which we'll get to later here, there's timestamps in the description, there's manual color correction of course and LUTs. Since a lot of you are familiar with LUTs, here's why you might want to consider using a Resolve Color Managed workflow instead. LUTs are always just averaging data transforms. It's an approximation instead of retaining 32-bit float level of accuracy and I love accuracy. Let's also lose clip detail downstream of when they're applied versus Resolve Color Management gives you access to all the original signal data at any moment during post-production. Resolve Color Management also lets you deliver to multiple screens by just changing your output color space in the project settings. Without touching a thing Resolve looks at clip metadata to make the transform adjustments. The metadata remaps tones, cessrations and colors, it's remapping the color space. However not all camera formats have clip metadata that Resolve can read. Raw footage will be set automatically like this B-Raw clip right here and so will a lot of MXF and MOV contained videos. But there's a lot of common footage like Sony XAVC-S that doesn't have metadata that Resolve can read. However you can find the color space metadata that was used to record with a free app called Sony Catalyst Browse which I'll link down in the description. So to manually tell Resolve what it's working with the input color space first make sure you're working in DaVinci YRGB color managed and on the media page right click column layout check input color space. This just gives you a bird's eye view. Next select the clips right click input color space and for these Sony clips we know that they're S-Log3 so it's as simple as choosing S-Gamut3.Cinny S-Log3 and you're done with those. Now take a look at the color page with Shift 6 and open the HDR palette which is color space aware and now you can control exposure just as if you were adjusting it in camera with the global exposure slider. Same thing with temperature tint saturation. They all behave in a new easy to use way that pinches off the highlights and shadows very smoothly. The curves and qualifiers also behave a little better now. Hey we're not done yet but I just want to take a quick second to welcome you if you're new to this channel it's called Creative Video Tips it's all about helping you create videos to make a difference and stand out. I'm Chadwick and I would love if you would subscribe right down below right now that way you don't miss out on more free DaVinci Resolve tips. Sometimes you'll be working with footage from a camera that does not match one of the preset input color space combo options that are available in Resolve but we still shot with a log profile so it could really use some magic sauce to make it look pretty without any initial color correction. Two examples I have of this here are from a Canon C200 and a DJI Mavic Air 2s. The Canon C200 shoots 8-bit Canon Log 3 Gamma but with a Rec 709 Gamut and not the Canon Cinema Gamut which is what Resolve wants you to use. Now you can split the input color space and gamma in the project settings but I want to quickly show you the color space transform effect which can be handy if it's just a single shot or two in your project. On the color page click on the C200 clip and check bypass color management. This removes that specific clip from the whole color managed pipeline however you'll notice nothing actually happened. I think this is a bug but the reason nothing happened is there's still a title on the layer above which is still color managed so the quick fix is to jump to the edit page you can use Shift 4 right click on the title and check bypass color management. Shift 6 and we're back in the color page with the flat Canon Log 3 clip. Click the open effects tab and drag the color space transform effect onto the clip node. Change the input color space to Rec 709 and change your input gamma to Canon Log 3 and you're normalized without having lost any signal information. Bypassing color management this way is also a useful technique if you want to add a film print emulation LUT to stylize things up a bit. The DJI Mavic Air 2S drone shoots 10-bit D-Log M which is not the same as the old D-Log input color space that's built into Resolve. So for this one we're going to use a LUT and grade underneath it. A link to download the free DJI LUT is in the description below but to add it to Resolve open your project manager with Command 9, go to color management, lookup tables, click open LUT folder, click and drag the custom DJI D-Log M LUT you just downloaded into the DJI folder, then click update list button and save. Now in the color page right click on the node go to LUT DJI D-Log M to Rec 709. Now you can use curves like I'm doing here I like to use editable splines, you can use color temperature, anything you want and you can even do it on that same node to get it looking good. All the changes are happening before the LUT that's applied on that same node so there's no reason to create a new node before it. This entire video I've shown you how to work with color space but haven't actually defined it and it actually has three parts to it. There's gamut which is a range of colors available then there's gamma this is a curve of brightness values it's also called a tone curve sometimes and then there's actually also a white point which is color temperature implied by the sensor so it's not anything that we're changing very often in resolve and haven't touched on in this video or this tutorial yet but if you want to learn more there's an effect that's on the color page called chromatic adaptation to take care of this. If you want to color manage a clip and don't want to use one of the three methods mentioned in this video you can also just simply right click input color space and go to bypass. This still uses all the under the intermediate transform help and will export with the output color space you have in your project settings so in other words it'll expand your waveform in contrast and it'll behave like other clips on your timeline which can be super helpful and if you found this video helpful please make sure to give it a like right now that way other creatives can find it too ask questions give advice in the comments and if you want to learn more about the venture result click on the playlist I have on screen right now because there's so much more to learn I'll see you in that next video
