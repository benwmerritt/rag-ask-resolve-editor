Hey guys, it's Chadwick here. I wanted to do a quick walkthrough of how you use DaVinci Resolve 10, which was recently released, to create dailies for use in NavVid for offline to online projects. So here we go. We will log in and what I usually do is always start up here as a home base, the untitled project, double click on it, and we have to change a couple things real quick off the bat. So we've got the settings gear down here, and the footage I know on this project is actually going to be 25 frames per second. Frames per second, it's a PAL project. So generally what we'll do is change video format to 1080p 23976 for our spots here in the US, but this footage that I got to test with is 1080p 25. So change that there so I can see it on my broadcast monitor. We will change timecode to be calculated at 25 as well. Again, if this was a commercial I'd normally be working on, it'd be 23976. And one check box that Resolve really should make a default here. Another timecode. We want to do embedded in source clip file. That's correct, but we want to check the box here for assist using real names from the click on embedding in source clip file. What this does is it makes sure that we are carrying the metadata that is in the stuff that's shot on the Alexa or Red Epic or C300 or whatever camera you're shooting with and it carries it through the whole pipeline. Real name or tape, whatever is called, is carried in the EDL when it's exported for online finishing somewhere else or color correction. Super important, we want to make sure we keep that when we're editing with these dailies that we're making. Click apply and cancel and now we need to save it. Say save project and name it something that makes sense for whatever you're editing. So for this we'll just call it avid dailies 25p test. One thing to note here, the name that you call this will be assigned to the MXF files if you create MXF dailies out of Resolve. The way that I actually prefer to work is to create quick times and fast import those into avid because it doesn't matter what this is. The advantage to using Resolve systems, Resolve Lite, is you can throw it on a bunch of computers that you have around your facility and make a lot of dailies really quickly. So that's pretty awesome. You're not tying up your avid with doing all the transcoding for you and not editing. So this also lets you bake in some contrast to make the footage look more normal, which is also super important, which we'll get to. So let's click save and now because the project is saved we can come back to that gear switch and turn our auto saves on. Having auto save is super important, especially when you've got people you're working with and computers crash. So there we go. Now we want to go over to media pool and pull footage in. You can tell down here we're on the media page and we'll click the plus. And let's call whatever folder is the same that is the card folder that you have once you've copied the media off to your hard drive or sand or wherever you're working on. So we'll call this one, say it's camera A, card 1, and then I always like to throw the data in there. So 2013, November 22nd. Now we can see this here, we see it over here. That's how we know where we're putting the footage. And this is actually just a link to the footage. I'm actually moving footage. Click do not use. This is a volume I've got some footage in here to play with, and our assets, video, and source. Now this is a folder template that I built using post taste, which is a super awesome free tool that's out there from digital rebellion. I'll throw the link in there. And I definitely recommend figuring out what folder system works for you and in the place you're at. So everything is uniform from project to project. Okay, if I click on Alexa log, this is the footage we'll pull in. And see if we got three shots up here. The easiest way to get it in though, especially if it was red or DSLR stuff and it's buried into several folders is right click, choose add folder and sub folders into media pool. Click it, done. Okay, we've got this footage into resolve. Now I'll go over to the next page, which is called edit. And it's basically where we're going to set our timeline up. To do this, we have to create a new timeline. Okay, click the plus button up here. We are going to, whoops, we're going to change the timeline name to whatever the card name is. So this is card one, camera A, and then I always like the date just to keep things unique. And new timeline that is empty. Okay, I'll come over here to the, you can see the footage clips, the media pool clips. You can select them all. And we've got our timeline loaded. You can see over here. And all we're going to do is overwrite those to the sequence. And boom. What we've just created is a string of all the footage that we shot on a specific card. That's typically how I'd make the dailies. Do one card at a time. Just a lot quicker and easier to make the global adjustments to all of it. Great. Now we move on to the color page. Okay. In here, the first thing I want to do is bake a lot that's either provided by the DIT or for instance, this is just standard log C stuff from Ralexa. So it has a built in LUT within Resolve. So what I'll do is I'll go up to track. What we do instead of being on a clip corrector, on a track corrector, it changes the values on all clips that are in that sequence basically. So to create a new correction on it, we will go up to nodes, add serial node, such option S. And if you right click on the clip and go to 3D LUT, go to ARI and we've got this ARI Alexa log C, it's a Rec. 709 LUT. Okay. Click on that guy and what this has just done is made footage look real and normal again. Super important I think to always edit whenever you can with Rec. 709 baked in, especially for TV commercials, which is what I deal in. So that way creatives don't get used to looking at this flat muddy image that does not look good and you can see the before and the after. It's pretty drastic because what will happen is they'll go into their color session thinking, hey, it kind of starts to grow on people after a while and they don't realize how gross it actually is and it kind of looks like an Instagram filter and it's generally not what the DP is wanting to, what he's really wanting to create. He's just giving you the log C stuff so there's flexibility. So if you don't show it to them, they don't get used to it and it just makes a better looking show. So the next thing I would do after we've applied this log C LUT, now maybe this is good enough if you're in a real crunch and you have to make them super fast, just do that. But I like to go in generally and make a little bit, not specific corrections, but just a little bit more, you know, just make them a little nicer. So I'll go under clip. We've got a corrector that's already set in here, one serial node and I will use the color wheels with under the log that gives you this offset wheel, which makes global changes to the whole image. So for this shot specifically, it's a little under exposed, so I'll use this to bring the overall brightness up on it and then maybe, you know, the black levels are a little too high now so I can go ahead and drop those back down. Something like that, you know, looks fine to me. I'll go into the next shot. This one, I think look fine as is. I won't change that at all. And then this shot, you know, is probably a little over exposed. So I'll bring this, drop it all the way down. I'm bringing it down a little bit just to sort of recover a little information in the highlights. Maybe drag this down. And, you know, if the white balance is off, then, you know, you can move the color wheel around and fix that here as well. But very quickly, we made footage that looks usable to edit with for an offline. And you can see the before and after by, was a command D. We'll go before and after on that correction. And if you went over and did the track one, it's more obvious because that was what actually put the initial curve back into the footage. All right. So we've got, say we had, you know, this might have been 40 shots or however many were shot on one roll. And we've got those all set to go. So I always like to save this point. And I jump, we skip the, we'll jump over to deliver. We skip the gallery page. This really only used for colorists when they are saving stills to, for certain looks. So we jump to deliver real quickly like that. We're on the first shot here. I like to make sure we're at the beginning, mark an in. So I jump to the last shot. Okay. Go all the way to the end, mark an out. And you know, you've selected every frame then. This little bar is kind of new and nice. Kind of looks like a work area and after effects kind of deal. And that basically just shows you've got everything selected. So what we want to do to output is I'll walk you through making, you know, a setup here, our preset. We want to export the timeline as individual source clips. Okay. So don't do single clip would just make one file out of everything, which is definitely not how we want to edit. We want to render to a quick time files. This is so that I can do a fast import. And that does take a slightly longer than if we were to do MXF media for Avid. However, the advantage I think outweighs it in terms of when you're going to close the project out at the end. Like I said, if you chose MXF here, what that means is that the files are going to be great. You can put them in, you know, this backdoor way of just dropping them into a numbered folder and Avid media files and dragging the media database file in. However, the reason it's not awesome is that the project name that you set your resolve project as actually gets baked into that MXF file. That can cause problems for media tool or media mover. Whenever you're trying to consolidate your footage or move your footage at the end of the show to clean up space, all that's going to be related to your resolve project. And what that means is you're going to have lots of footage from multiple projects, MXF, metadata inside of your one main Avid project. So for tight end and sake, I like to do the fast import. So we will choose Quick Time and we will change the codec here to DNxHD36, okay, which is great standard offline editing codec. We're going to leave frame rate at 25. Again, that would have been 23976 for an American thing. And we want to check the box surrender audio. So take whatever scratch audio was on that camera. It makes it easier for syncing or having a guide on there. Might as well keep it if it was there. And then down below under file name, we always want to use the source file name. So the file name should match exactly back to whatever the source was. Cool. We want to render the job to click browse. You have to jump back through their file browser in here. And assets, video, we have a folder here for trans codes. And then what I do is make a new folder inside of trans codes. So every card gets its own folder inside of trans codes as well. I named this exactly the same as it would have been in the source folder. So this is camera A, card 1, 1, 3 for 2013, 11 and the 22nd of the month. OK. OK. Sweet. That's pretty much all you got to do. This is going to render out pretty fast. We've only got 816 frames to render. To do this, we go over here to add job to render queue. And there we go. And hit start render. If I call your attention up here to the top left, it'll tell you how fast it's going. Right now it's going 55, 60 frames per second, which is pretty fast. That's because we're rendering out Alexa ProRes 4x4s, which is good codec to another intraframe codec, the DNx36. The H264 stuff is going to be slower. Red stuff is going to be even slower still, depending on what your debaring settings are.
