Did you get an overheating warning on your Sony a7S III or brand new Sony FX3? Well today I'm going to show you the menu setting that's in here that you need to change so that doesn't happen. So all we need to do in the menu here of a Sony FX3 or a7S III go down to the very bottom, the yellow menu for setup. We're going to go across down to item number 8 which is power setting option and we're going to change the auto power off temperature from standard to high. I wish they had this by default but they don't. But anyways this is going to give you a warning. It'll say the temperature of the device may rise to prioritize recording time. Do you want to change this setting? Absolutely we do. No worries it's not going to melt your camera. Everything's going to work fine and you won't have to worry about the camera wanting to shut off automatically. So now your a7S III, your FX3 is not going to overheat.
