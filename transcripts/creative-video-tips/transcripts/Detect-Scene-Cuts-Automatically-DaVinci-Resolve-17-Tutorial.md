Today I want to show you how easy it is to import a video into DaVinci Resolve 17 for color correction even if it was edited in Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere with just a single baked exported video file. Let's get into it. So this video is all about the brand new detect scene cut feature that's under the timeline menu in the all new DaVinci Resolve 17 and I also want to show you the scene cut detection which is a different thing in media pool. To use detect scene cuts we need to make sure we're in DaVinci Resolve 17 at least this is beta 6 that's out right now. You're just going to grab a full resolution edited video if you can make it ProRes that's going to work easier on your system drag that into your media pool go to your cut page and let's drop it on a timeline we'll call this detect scene cuts okay we can drag that in our folder and then drag our footage down here to the timeline and you can see here on our edit page we have a single long two and a half minute long video but there's clearly lots of cuts in the color page real quick this is one single clip so this is the point of this whole thing is we want to be able to color correct the video shot by shot and to do that we need to chop it up so the way you would do that if you were not able to automate it which you can do now is you could just step through it which you've probably done before step through the clip and you can use command backslash we'll create a cut and then you can see oh now we have two shots but we actually need 50 for this so this would be a real tedious way of going through an entire video so we don't want to do that I'm going to do command z to undo that and we're going to use the new feature selecting the footage on our timeline detect scene cuts so we'll choose this and let it run so DaVinci Resolve calls it the neural engine that's doing this so it's it's a new way and it's a little simpler than scene cut detection which i'm going to show you later in this video so it's it's pretty amazing it's going through this whole two minute video in probably half real time and what it's looking for is difference in contrast composition and it's doing a pretty decent job one thing i haven't tested but it's probably likely is if you were using log footage it might not be able to do quite as good a job as something like this that already has a bit of contrast in it just something to note all right it seems to be done if we go to the color page now we can see now we have 50 shots so it has done a pretty great job of going through this entire video and finding cuts at the right point so you can see the timeline there's a shot cuts to the next shot and has just dropped those has split those clips at the right moment what if it does not do it correctly well you can go back into here which and i know there's two shots in here that that don't quite work there's a cross dissolve on them so we have a shot here where she's coming up out of the jeep and it does a cross dissolve to her already out of the jeep so if we go to the midpoint between the two and do a command backslash there now we have created an extra shot we should see there are 51 shots and in fact i think there's one more of those in here that it didn't quite catch so it's not foolproof but it's pretty great like for me to go through and do that manually would have taken you know much longer time than the 30 or so seconds it took to do the two minutes with the computer doing it for me so here's the other spot so if we go left and then it goes to this cool shot from the outside so if you just do a command backslash and that's right where that crosses all this now we have instead of 51 shots in a time when we have 52 shots to color correct and work on one of the things i really love about detect scene cuts is it gives you a lot of flexibility after the fact after you've run the neural engine process so now i fake this here but let's say it messed up and it put a cut between these two shots right here and you can see it went from 21 to 22 right um i i fake that but let's say it did that on accident and we need to clean that up so that we don't have all these extraneous shots you can go back to the edit page you can select the edit point and you can delete that and so now we return back to the color page and it's a single shot so that is uh that's pretty helpful that's not something you're able to do with scene cut detection which i'm going to show you in just a minute now another thing the detect scene cuts feature gives you is ability to take a cut um and roll it left and right um this is something that if it was just off by a frame or two you could easily do that um and that's again that's something you cannot do using scene cut detection and that's because it's referring to a single clip back in the media pool so if we looked here it's the whole thing is still based off of one single clip which in my mind makes sense because it is one single clip so that's uh that's just something to note that's one of the differences between detect scene cuts and scene cut detection is that you have a little bit more flexibility on the timeline after the fact one more tip i have for detect scene cuts is rather than selecting the clip and going to timeline the text scene cuts you can actually narrow in and just say hey i don't really need to pay attention to part of it or cut up part of it maybe it's an hour long program you can mark an end point and an out point on something and then just say hey i just want to do the scene cut detection excuse me that detect scene cuts they couldn't have made that more confusing on just that region so if you mark it in and out it should obey just that section so we've done that and we go to timeline detect scene cuts and you can see the playhead there has started right where my endpoint is and rather than us having you know 50 or so shots i'm expecting we have about a third of that okay there we go so it's pretty darn sweet we look here it was right when we started doing our endpoint out point selecting that range it has marked our clips so and it's it's done a really great job of doing that again next up we're going to be looking at the scene cut detection window in DaVinci Resolve which has been around for years and i've used it thousands of times it works great but i just want to let you know if you're new here my name is Chadwick this is creative video tips it's all about helping you create videos that make a difference and stand out if that's the kind of thing you're into click subscribe right now so you don't miss my tip next week now let's take a look at the alternate way of cutting up an edited video using scene cut detection to use scene cut detection you're going to be in the media page and this is all going to happen before you bring the video into the project so you've got your single edited video you're going to right click on it you're going to say scene cut detection and this brings up a whole new interface with a different playhead and what you're basically looking at here is the middle frame is the frame you're parked on the one to the left is the frame before it and then one frame to the or the the window here on the right is the frame after the what's on the playhead so what we're going to try to do is have this to double check our cuts before they're added into the project what this means is the two here on the right are going to look like the same shot and the one on the left will be different if it does it correctly now to kick it off and get it started you just go to the lower left there's a button called auto scene detect click it and it's running through and the green bars the height of them basically is telling you how confident it thinks that is actually a cut and if it's lower it thinks it's less likely that it's a cut and then the magenta bar after this is done running you can raise or lower it and it will turn those little gray ones green and it'll actually count those as cuts so I know right here right away like it's missed some cuts so like there's a shot there and we're on another shot there so but if you drag this magenta bar down now it's actually going to think that that is a cut and over on the right side we have a list of all the cuts so if we click down to the next one we can see on the left side window here there's one shot and then the right side with these two together that's the same shot so that's what we want to be seeing on all of the cuts now as we go through it has definitely at least at this medium sort of confidence it's definitely missed a lot more cuts than the new method that uses the neural engine we can drag this down further here and we'll catch some more of them but when we do that just know we are also catching a lot of noise and sort of junk here in this section which it's dealing with cross dissolves it might be dealing with fades or something whatever you're looking at here that's push play yeah so it's I think what's getting really confused with is the blinking lights in the background so it's it's it's it's basically it gets you a good start but it's not going to be perfect so you'll still want to go through and remove edits that are not happening at the right spot or add them where it maybe has missed some so like for instance right here another one of these crosses all of it cannot find so if you just put the playhead where it's sort of the middle point of two different shots you know you can do that let's say we want to do it I don't know right there you can just click add and that adds a cut you can see that just added that right there so it basically added a new shot that we can then color correct differently on the timeline in the upper right three dot menu here you have the option to load an EDL so if your editor that's going to send you the video from something else can actually export an EDL which you can do really simply in Adobe Premiere you can load the EDL in here and it's going to use that in conjunction with your auto scene detect or in lieu of it and that'll give you really good results you can also save the scene cut file which is a .sc file I believe and what that means is if you have like a really long project maybe it's an hour long show or something you can save part of your work of all that pruning you've done as a separate file have it and then send it to another person that's going to actually do the color correction work so it could be like an assistant doing it or something so that's just a file that contains this cut information it's all about that file before it's brought into the project and then there's also some other tools up here for like pruning and pruning basically means hey you know we have all these marks but there's nothing actually going on that we need in that section so you would mark an in point or an out point and then you can click prune from up there or there's this little scissor and you click that and then all those extra green ticks go away the other thing you can do in this scene cut detection window is add cuts if you see a spot where I missed one and you would just park your playhead wherever you think that should be at and then click add and then once I've done that you can see it put a green bar there so it's basically going to make a new clip a virtual clip out of that section now how do we get these into the project you just go to the lower right here where it says add cuts to media pool you click that once and then we have individual clips in the media pool for each of those things that I thought was an individual shot now what's interesting about this is these have hard limits for the top and tail which once they're on a timeline which is what we're going to do next here we'll just go over here and say we'll select all these from the beginning to the end and we'll drop them down here is when you get to the edit page and see all these cuts this is one of the things that really differs between the other version is we don't have through edits anymore so what that means we can't select that and say delete right it's because it's a different source clip so you can go in and trim it like you you know if you needed to do a cut down or something but you can't remove that so if your first step where you do the scene cut detection is wrong it's kind of a pain in the butt to put it lightly you have to do all your work in that separate window and if you don't do it right it's it's much more difficult to to deal with having mistakes there but you can't do a roll if it missed it by a frame and you can't delete it so definitely a disadvantage there to the old school way of doing it but the fact that you can save a scene cut file or you can load an edl those are really still useful tools so now you know all about importing a video that's already been cut and exported from another application there is another way of working with footage to color correct it and eventually resolve it involves using the source camera footage and an instruction list called an xml or edl if you're interested in how that works please leave a comment below that'll let me know that that might be a video worth making and i can show you how to do that as well it's a little bit more complicated so that's why it's not the first video i made but it actually works really great especially if you're using final cut pro because the xml translates really good i hope you got something on this video again if you got something out of it please click like and ask any questions in the comments the venture resolve is continuing to involve so i'll be curious if they keep both of these scene cut detection methods around for a long time this video may only be useful for a year or two but i hope it was useful to you today and i'll see you in the next video
