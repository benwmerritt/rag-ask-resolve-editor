DaVinci Resolve 20 Fixed Black Magic Cloud Storage for Collaboration, let me explain. One of the best features of Black Magic Cloud Storage is that you have the option to create a proxy only synced project. So that keeps your costs really down, the file transfers aren't super huge, and you do that, go into your project settings, Black Magic Cloud is up top now, and you choose Sync Proxies only. But what happens when you get to a final stage and you need to send certain clips at full resolution, maybe to a Fusion Artist or maybe you need to send it for color grading. Now you have the option to selectively pick clips from your media pool to get the originals uploaded just for those specific clips. It's as easy as right clicking in the media pool, this isn't going to be a long video, I'm going to show you how I do that. I'm going to right click on this clip here on the timeline, we'll go to Find in Media Pool, and then once you find it in the media pool you can right click on it, and we'll come right on down here to Sync Original Media. So once you check that, you've got your Black Magic Cloud kicking off and syncing up right here, it's going to start sending that original file, it's going to send the full length of that original file up to Black Magic Cloud so that it can be downloaded on the other end by your colorist or VFX artist. So it's basically go to the bin, right click, choose Sync Original Media. I would love if there's a feature in the future where you could just say Sync All Original Media for a specific timeline, even better than that maybe even trim and sync media, but really this is a great start so we can still continue to use a proxy only workflow for Black Magic Cloud and only send the original full res clips that are a lot heavier when we need them.
