If you're using Sony Imaging Edge webcam software to level up those zoom calls or your YouTube streams with like a Sony ARX100 or Sony Mirrorless camera, you might notice that your battery is depleting much faster and you're running out before the day is over. Well today I've got two battery solutions that are going to keep you going all day long. Let's get into it. Real quick if you're new here my name is Chadwick. This is Creative Video Tips where I help you create videos that make a difference and stand out. If that's something you're into, click subscribe so you don't miss my tip next week. Alright so here are the two battery solutions I've got if you're using Sony Imaging Edge webcam. The first one is actually free. There's two USB settings that you want to take a look at. One of them is going to let you actually use the USB interface, the little plug here on the side to work with your computer which I show in this video that I'll link right here. You want to set USB connection to PC remote. That's the first thing but a couple under that, at least on the ARX1005 and I think the ZV1, they have a thing called USB power supply. And so by turning USB power supply on it's going to be able to take some of the power and the charge that's coming from your computer's USB hub or the back of the computer and feed power into the battery which will keep that going longer. So that's option one. That's totally free, easy to do. Okay now option two, it's going to cost a little bit of money. It's only 20 bucks. This one I got off of Amazon. It's a dummy battery. So a dummy battery is what you want to be looking at. This one is a DKX1. It weighs like nothing but it has all of the right contact points that the same as these NPBX1s that I would go through like crazy if I wasn't streaming. This just has a cable that runs out of the bottom of the camera and it plugs into a USB port like a it could go into a wall charger or you know a battery like this if you need to be a little bit more mobile and you're away from a power you know an outlet in the wall. So what you'll do is you'll just pop open where your battery normally is, get rid of that sucker and then this will go in the exact same slot. So that just goes in like so and there is a little tab right here on this camera that you just kind of pull back and that's going to let the cord come through there and still let you close the door, close the little lock and you should be able to power it right on up which you can do like that. So we've got this power cable which is really nicely firmly snugly securely I guess is the word attached to a USB battery bank which will last I mean for a super super long time. You definitely could get a long day out of a battery like this. This is the I think it's 10,000 milliamp hour anchor battery but there's others like it. There's some that are larger. You just want to make sure that it's not supplying more than 5 volts. They warn that make sure that you only supply 5 volts because if you're doing this second method and you're not doing the USB power supply in the menu you run the risk of frying your camera if it goes over that 5 volts. So these anchor ones they suggest them so I would probably choose them because you don't have the protection of USB going into here to charge a battery which is then supplying power. It's just directly coming from the source over these you know these little connection points these little pins that are on the dummy battery. So dummy battery is a great option so you just got to make sure it's only supplying 5 volts at the most and if it's not supplying at least two amps it's not going to be enough to power the camera which is why sometimes you'll find a computer port using option one that I just showed you turning USB power supply on that it actually will drain the battery over a long period of time which you're eventually going to run out of power. One final tip I want to give you if you're having trouble connecting with Sony imaging edge webcam is to make sure you turn the dial on your Sony camera to the auto mode when you first launch the software and then once you're in preferences and you see the image then just switch that over to movie mode and that may that's going to give you full manual control if you want that so you can dial in the exposure but if you're not seeing any picture make sure it's in auto mode first I've noticed if it's in anything else sometimes zoom doesn't see it or you know like a youtube stream would not see that so I hope this was helpful if it was please give it a like ask any questions in the comments so we can all learn from each other and I'll see you in the next one
