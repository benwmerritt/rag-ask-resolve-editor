If you're having trouble moving a timeline from Premiere Pro to DaVinci Resolve because the scale or position is all messed up from mixed resolutions, here are the two things to fix. In Premiere, set your scaling to Set to Frame Size. Set to Frame Size sets the clip scale effect so that Resolve can read an XML file correctly. You can change the default for new clips if you open up preferences and media and change the default media scaling to Set to Frame Size. Now over in Resolve, open your project settings and go to Image Scaling. Then input scaling and set mismatch resolution files to Center Crop with no resizing. These settings should fix those conform issues, but if you're confused about what the heck I'm even talking about and you want to verify you imported a pixel perfect translation, stick around for the next couple minutes to learn how to send a timeline from Adobe Premiere to DaVinci Resolve. XML is the key to moving your project into Resolve with the most information for further editing or color grading. This stands for Extensible Markup Language, but basically it's a file type that other apps can understand. In our case, it's the instruction list of how an edited timeline is put together with links to the assets and time could use. There are no media assets stored in the XML file, so it's super tiny. You can even email it. Creating the XML file is as simple as going to File, Export, and choose Final Cut Pro XML. This is an old format, but still works just fine. You'll also get a translation report you can read for things that might not work. Here's a list of things that I've noticed not translating over to Resolve. The next step I highly suggest is creating a reference video from Premiere to check the accuracy of your imported timeline over in Resolve. Go to File, Export, Media, and I like to add reference to the end of the filename so I don't confuse it for anything else. Now create a new project in DaVinci. Go directly to Project Settings. Change Scaling and change the Input Scaling to Center Crop with No Resizing. Now you can import the XML and it'll try to pull all the linked media along with it and use the correct sizing and positioning. Just go up to File, Import, Timeline, and choose the XML that was just created from Premiere. Resolve also accepts EDL files from Premiere, but they're more limited with their information, so I only use those for troubleshooting. Leave the boxes as is on the Load XML box, click OK, and boom. If all went well, you have your Premiere Timeline in Resolve. Real quick, time out. If you're new here, welcome. I'm Chadwick. This is Creative Video Tips, which is here to help you craft stories that make a difference in standout. So if you're into that, subscribe right now so you don't miss out on next week's tip. Now let me show you my favorite way to double check the accuracy of the imported timeline. Import your reference video to your project by dragging it from the Finder. Then Option Drag your reference video from the Media Pool bin to the Timeline on a track above all the editable clips. Option dragging will only pull the video portion of the clip. Select the reference clip, open the Inspector, and change the Composite mode to Difference. Play through your cut, and if it's black, there's no difference between the exported reference and your new Resolve sequence. After checking that it matches, you can delete the reference video from the Timeline. Resolve also has an offline reference video feature, but hey, that's for another day, and it's more beneficial for before and afters than the color page. Now that you have your project in DaVinci, you probably want to learn more about how to use the software. I have a great playlist right over here for you to check out that's going to cover so many of the pitfalls that everyone encounters when they're new to Resolve. And because there's so much more to learn, I'll see you in the next video.
