So one of the biggest questions I always get asked is should I buy DaVinci Resolve Studio or can I just use the free version and does the free version Suck well the free version. No, it does not suck. You don't need to buy DaVinci Resolve Studio Okay, hear me out But the reason that I bought it I thought would be nice to put in a top 10 list for you today This is no particular order But the number one reason that I bought DaVinci Resolve Studio 10 years ago for a thousand dollars was noise reduction That was built in to the color page. It's native. It works with the GPU So it's really fast. It also has a motion blur tab. So if you shoot stuff that Needs to be sped up a bunch. You can get that realistic motion blur added back on it also works in the fusion page So anytime you have noisy grainy footage because the ISO needed to be turned up on the camera noise reduction It's gonna be your friend and it's there in the studio version Number two is codec support DaVinci Resolve Studio is the Swiss Army knife of post-production And it will handle pretty much every camera format resolution you throw at it But the free version doesn't if you've ever noticed you get a red offline Image in your viewer and you do have audio It's usually because that codec's not supported because black magic would have to pay licensing fees to use that codec So in Resolve Studio, it's all taken care of everything's gonna work. There's one tiny exception That's ProRes raw, but that's for our conversation another day The third reason you should consider studio is Magic Mask Magic Mask is an AI based way of using motion vectors to extract a foreground from a background So if you need to color correct something separately if you need to there's a big thing But right now with putting text between a background and a foreground Magic Mask is gonna let you do that really easily It's great. It's not perfect and I've got tutorials on how you can fix it over in the fusion page But Magic Mask is indispensable in post-production today The fourth reason is text-based editing and audio subtitles what I'm talking about here is if you right-click on a clip You can transcribe it It'll tell you all the text that's in that clip so you can highlight it and edit just like you were in a Google Doc It's incredible You can find inflections of words and change things out sort of Franken bite things together to tell the best story that you can And the audio subtitles is a great way to sort of automatically caption your thing with really accurate captions That you can then export an SRT to YouTube or bake them in like you would on a TikTok video It's super super handy really really fast and extremely editable and the best part is all these AI features They don't go reach out to the internet and take anybody else's Unlicensed IP content like a lot of other stuff does out there The fifth reason for resolve studio over the free version is the default IntelliTrack point tracker for doing any kind of visual effects Maybe you want to stick text to an object and have it follow the IntelliTrack point tracker just makes it easier There's less options that you could screw up and in my opinion just having an extra new tracker involved It gives you more opportunities to solve a difficult shot. My sixth reason for studio is voice isolation We don't always get to control our environments where we shoot or film and a lot of times There's a lot of background noise in it So voice isolation will help you drown out that background and separate and pull out that voice One way that I use this recently was actually filming a conference where there was a PA system that had a lot of reverb in the room Voice isolation did an excellent job of removing the reverb so that I was only hearing the lavalier that was on the talent And it made a much better sounding video. So getting windows or natural light into the treatment space can become a challenge But it does make for really efficient and effective flow through your hospital Number seven is remote monitoring and why that is so great is you can livestream your timeline out your color accurate timeline to Anybody anywhere in the world to work collaboratively in real time So that means if you have the tiny change to make you don't have to make the change Post it have them go look at frame. I owe to download make notes No, you just do this all live in real time You get your zoom call going and it's done number eight It's gonna be remote rendering and that allows you to use another computer That's on your local network to do all the hard work and rendering so that after you assign it to the remote render computer You can go back to working and not wait for the video to finish encoding and making its export You can make your social media versions or keep editing with a client if they're in the room with you Number nine is timeline based scene cut detection and what that allows you to do is you can take one long video file With all the cuts sort of baked in put it on your timeline and this will chop up your video into individual clips Which is great if you want to color correct something and have it all broken up So you can color correct one shot differently than the next shot and because they're just cuts on your timeline It's easy to change and fix it for some reason. I got it wrong You can just delete the cut or you can add more cuts on the timeline to pick up things that maybe I missed and The tenth reason you should buy resolve studio is that it allows you to send a clean feed of your signal to a secondary Computer monitor so maybe you don't have a calibrated external display with a 3g ultra studio card That's fine. This will allow you at least when you're cutting to see all the minutiae things like is an eye blinking Or does a head turn is there some small reaction that you can't see when it's in a little tiny viewer on your main monitor? This gives you a full screen option on a secondary display. I appreciate you so much. Thanks for sticking around My name is Chad oak if you're new here.
