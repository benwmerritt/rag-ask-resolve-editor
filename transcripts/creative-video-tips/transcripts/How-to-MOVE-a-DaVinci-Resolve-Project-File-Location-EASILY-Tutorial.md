Maybe you know you can double click a DaVinci Resolve project file to import it on a Mac, but did you know that if you hold option and right click to import that you can actually set your gallery stills location automatically with import plus? Or maybe you're curious where are my projects even saved to and what the heck is a database and what if DaVinci Resolve crashes? Will I lose all my hard work? I've got answers to those important questions and more broken into three chapters in today's creative video tips. Super quick, first things first make sure you go turn on autosaves right now if you haven't already done so because they are not on by default and this is how you do that. To turn your autosaves on and DaVinci Resolve 17 disk databases you go to preferences and then across to user preferences, project save and load and then right in our save settings we have life save. Turn life save on that is going to save every change you make as you make it. It's a lot like saving in Final Cut Pro so if the system goes down it can come right back up right away. Project backups is basically incremental saves based off of these settings that you you turn on here so they're full DaVinci Resolve project files that you can load in in the project manager so I set mine to every 10 minutes that's how much I'm comfortable with losing work is 10 minutes worth of work basically for a day and then a week's worth of work and the important thing is you want to set your project backup location and set it to a location that's different from where you're storing your disk database and we'll get into that in the next section here but I set mine to creative cloud file so it's automatically uploading to the cloud I don't have to worry about it I can get to it from anywhere but it could also go to an external hard drive and that would work great as well let's click okay and then save and then how do you load those in so those are saving right every 10 minutes but you use the project manager which is a little house down here in the lower right or you can hit shift 1 to get there and you load them in by right clicking on the project and then you go down to project backups and then you see all your projects right there so these are all timestamped choose the one you want to load from you know just click it right there say load and then it's going to want to create a new project file based off of a copy of that just give it a second it's going to create that for you and then you can go back to your project manager click on it and get going right from where you left off now that we have live save and project backups turned on we don't have all our eggs in one basket and trust me this is going to save your bacon big time one day so you don't lose those perfect edits and color grades now the first time you create a new project into ventures off it creates a database for you and the way you find it is by clicking this little home button the project manager and clicking this guy right here and you can click this info button it's going to give you a little bit more information but what I suggest is you right click you say reveal and finder that takes you right to where it's located I keep mine in my documents folder it's probably buried in your library somewhere and application support if you haven't changed the default of it but if you just go down the trail here it's inside users and inside guest for legacy purposes is why it's in the guest folder there used to be like you know multiple users on a single station and they don't do that anymore but they're in the guest folder but within here we have all of these folders and the project name is always project dot db and the reason I want to show you this is because you do not want to be renaming anything or changing inside the finder level with the ventures off you want to do it within the project manager so let's say we wanted to rename something you right click on it instead and you say rename and we can just call this v2 and you can see it updates itself in the finder so just leave finder alone do it all within the project manager and you should be good to go now what if we want to organize everything that's in here well that's where folders come in so we can create a new folder really easily by just you know clicking new folder give it a name and then the way you get projects in it is you just click and drag until you get that little plus and it's going to dump it in there for you you can even do folders inside folders do the whole inception thing but now that we're stuck in here how do I get back out to that rule level I can't click here that doesn't do anything you actually click this breadcrumbs trail and that gets us back out but what if I want to get the project back out of that folder this is a little trick that a lot of people don't know about so if you're inside of there you can't just click and drag it doesn't come right out what you need to do is cut and paste you right click and you say cut okay and it looks like it didn't do anything to add like you're like you're you're nuts but it did so let's go back over to projects and then we can right click and say paste and just like that it has come right back out of that folder the folder is empty it's on the root level of that database so that's how you move the projects out and around another really useful organizational thing that's in the databases over here is if you click the list view and then go over to columns there's a section for notes the way you add notes is real simple inside the project when you're working in it you go down to project notes and you type something that might be useful to someone like that you know and then once you do that you just hit the x it automatically saves it you can go back to project manager with shift one or it's at little heist a house icon and it shows up right there alongside all the rest of your projects so that's super useful let's click thumbnail right back over here so we can see nice little pictures again and one of the complaints I get a lot with the resolves I can't have two projects open at the same time we kind of can and the way you do that is you right click and you say dynamic project switching turn that sucker on and now I can open up another project and kind of have them both loaded into RAM at the same time so if I double click this one this through the loom one I can switch between the two really quickly I can copy and paste between the two really quickly so one way you can do that is up here at the top you just click that drop down you can go to the other project or you could go to file switch project through the loom I'm over there really simple and the way we can double check to make sure what's loaded into RAM is this little house icon the project manager we both have check marks here for this one and this one so they're both essentially open at the same time that's dynamic project switching what if I have a new client or I just need to make a new database because I've got two main projects in one but I want to take a project from one database and put in the other let me show you how to do that first we're going to create a new database by clicking new database we'll call this demo and we have to put it in a new empty folder so we'll click browse to find the location where we want to be putting in I'm going to put it on my internal hard drive because that's what's fastest and we'll create a new folder inside there that's empty we'll call it demo I like to make sure my folders match my database names it's not necessary but I do that click open and create and just like that we have a new empty database I'm going to get rid of this info thing so we have a little bit more space to work within C but if I want to get a new project in there it's really simple all you're going to do is go to the database that has the project you want to copy over you select it you hit command C on the keyboard you go to the other database and I think you know where I'm going with this I hit command V and boom just like that that project a copy of it is placed in the other database now you can even copy and paste between different types of databases so we've been in the disk database but I also have a postgres SQL database for shared projects over here so if I click on that I could take this project here hit command C go back to our demo one that we had just created hit command V and in just a second that project is pasted over there so it works both ways and by the way if you want to know more about shared projects with DaVinci Resolve like you can have multiple editors in the same projects or colorists working at the same time on the same timeline basically if you want to know more about that leave a comment down below so I know how much interest there is in that that's something I do at my office and it's a super cool workflow so I'd love to share that if it's useful if it's not I don't want to waste my time doing I'll get something that you need to know okay so let's say we are done with this database we want to delete it we want to get rid of it the way you do that is you actually disconnect it you disconnect it by right clicking on the database saying disconnect and yes we're going to disconnect it I know what I'm doing here it's gone from resolve but it's not gone from your computer you need to actually do that from the finer so you'd go back over to where you know you have it located we called it demo I would just put this in the trash it's as simple as that so let's say pretend we had deleted that um but what if we wanted to bring it back what if we had just misplaced it or it's coming from another system or something you can actually link and sort of reconnect to it so the way we do that is there's a button right here that's what this two-way error thing is connect databases you click that and this would actually give you an opportunity to rename the the database what if we want to call this one database uh you know demo two instead of demo and then you just point to where it's located which is of course this demo folder and then say connect give it a second and boom it's it's back up ready to rock and roll another thing result makes it super easy is to back up your database if you just click this button right here when you have your database selected you want to back up you click back up we will put it on the desktop because that's kind of what you do in tutorials right you click save we say backup and uh it's going to take a few minutes for sure and boom it's done so if we go into a new machine we're going to update our software this is something you probably want to do before that and then the way you bring it back is the button right next to it so it's called restore you hit restore you choose that disk db file you say open and again we have an option here to give it a new name because we're making a new database from that it's kind of like when we were doing the auto saves and doing a new project so we'll call this one uh cvt i don't know two or something like that we'll tell it where we want it to go and again we create a new empty folder call it cvt to hit create hit open hit create and it's going to say it's going to take some time it's not going to take that long we'll just hit restore boom it's it's already done how fast was that so we have cvt to right here so that's basically how you back up and restore databases here in the venture resolve 17 databases are great things they help resolve access the information that it needs much faster and that's why if you've ever heard of avid having good media management it's because avid uses a database to keep track of all the footage resolves basically doing the same thing except with the projects and the databases can also save you time because you're never guessing where did I store that one specific project file at now no footage actually lives inside the database instead it stores the projects and then the projects store all the metadata about your timelines your clips your bins and creative video tips which is the channel you're watching right now stores all kinds of great tutorials and tricks to help you create videos that make a difference and stand out i'm chat wick and if you've learned anything new today i'd love for you to consider subscribing right now so you don't miss out on more great tips and totally free next up i want to show you how to move projects between editing systems if you work from multiple machines like i do you're going to be exporting projects a lot so do that you go to file export project and i like to just give them my dates or increment them with a new number call it v2 and this has just created a self-contained you know project file that you can then email you can load on a hard drive it's really easy portable and it's it's actually very small if i do command i it's you know this one's two megabytes but the thing that's really important to understand is that this is an exported project it's just like a way to transfer the material so if when we open this up let's say we double click it to open it and launch it you are now working on an imported project that is not referring to this at all anymore it's just like that was the starting point so you can't like take v2 work on it and then think you can send this v2 to someone else then it has all the changes no the changes are now inside the imported project that would then you would need to export again which you could do with the same name and you know replace files or whatever the the file name and write over it that would be fine but it's not actually happening to that file and like i showed at the beginning of the video one of the coolest ways to import something if we go back to our project manager with shift one is to option right click because this gives us the import plus uh import project plus option which is going to transfer over things like our gallery stills so that it's updated to what's on your current machine and they're not stuck to what's on the other machine you click open and this like we see here this is importing it's not it's not actually working from that version so we've exported project files backed up databases but those are only metadata what if we need to include footage with it that's where archives come in if we right click on a project here and we say export project archive what this is going to let us do well it tells us where do we want to save it let's put on our desktop because that's what we do in tutorials and we're going to turn off render cache we have the option of including our original media or our proxy media or just one of the other so if you needed to send this to someone and it's coming back you could just do proxy media would make it really small let's say in this instance i want to do four res media files i just have that checked i click okay and it starts cooking and exporting that for us right now it's bundling up all the footage that's used in that project so that someone else can open it on another machine and we check over here in our finder and we get this nice little folder called the dot dra diventures all archive and within it it's got all our media in it and it's got a d r p file to work from now if you wanted to bring that back into another system that's super simple too all you need to do is right click and say restore project archive super simple right and you point to that archive you click open and we're going to call this one you know version three smart reframe demo three we'll click okay and it has brought all that stuff in just like that and lastly i want to point out divintia resolve 17 has a new feature called timeline files if you go up to file export timeline there is a divintia resolve timeline file so if you're going from divinci to divinci this is a great way to do it it has a lot more compatibility and information than an xml or af edl does you could just hit save and it just exported this timeline only and you can see they're really small files so you could easily just message this to someone put it in email it's 251 kilobytes so that's that's a quick way to just move a timeline from one resolve system to another and now that you've mastered divintia resolve databases and projects that's really just the beginning click right up here right now to learn more about divintia resolve and since there's so much more to learn i'll see you in that next video
