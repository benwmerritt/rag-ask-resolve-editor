It's easy, just hit the sync button, right? I bet you're here because you know syncing multiple video clips into vintage resolve is not always straightforward. So today I want to share with you a super cool new trick I learned to unlock and fix an existing sync bend group for editing multi-cam videos with the speed editor in the cut page. Spoiler alert, the brilliance behind this trick is that you can actually open a media sync bend file in a timeline over in the edit page and not be stuck by the limitations of the open sync group command that's in the cut page. So this gives you a lot more precision. But let's rewind so I can show you three quick steps to prep your footage before you even click that sync button. So here in resolve 17, I've got a bucket full of footage from a music video I worked on, but there's not much metadata associated with the footage. So we're going to go to list view and we're going to be signing camera numbers to each of the clips. That's the key here. So if you right click in this column view, if you don't have camera number available, you right click and you can choose it. It's a checkbox right up there. So now that that's available, we can quickly assign camera numbers to each of them right here by just clicking on it and then typing it in. So one, this is going to be my base layer shot. This was another take. So that'll be two. And I'm just going to go and hit return to make those editable like so and keep going down until we get to all eight angles. And just so you know, there is also an option. If you click, there's a great little metadata. I guess it's a tab or whatever up here in the upper right. And as long as you're in the first one, the shot and scene metadata fields, you have the options here of choosing camera number. And I'll do another video at some point about renaming clips using the metadata because it's super powerful. I just want to make sure you get the point across that if you assign your camera numbers here first before you try to do sync bin, it's going to make your life a lot easier because it's going to make sure that you're able to say, I want everything from camera one to be on the same video track in your sync bin. The next thing to watch out for is to make sure you have audio on tracks one. So if you click this area over here, you would think that if you chose zoom audio waveform, you saw audio waveforms. In fact, you could hear them that you'd be good to go, but you'd be mistaken. Let's choose the audio tab right here and we'll find out that actually there's only audio on three and four. So we're going to use clip attributes to program three and four into one and two. All is not lost. So we're going to right click right here and choose clip attributes. We are going to say, let's make a new stereo track because we know this is a music video and that's what our final mix is going to be. So we're going to add that right there and then we're going to delete the rest of these mono tracks because we don't want to use those. We're going to be actually using the embedded stuff that's in channels three and channels four and pump that into this new stereo track that is on track one. So by clicking okay, we essentially have taken this and we fed three and four into one and two. So because there's something on one now that can sink. So that's the first thing is make sure you have audio on tracks one. And the next thing is we want to go ahead and set up our master angle to have the great either field recorder sound or the mastered audio mix from this song that we're working with today. So I've already taken the liberty of putting a marker at the downbeat. You can kind of see over here if I choose audio track right at the downbeat of the beginning of this song. So we have a sync point to it and I've done the same thing here with the audio track. You can always do this automatically just so you know there's an option. If you right click on them, you can say auto sync audio with based on waveforms. But what if your audio sucks? A lot of people don't know that this is here to do manually. So I want to show it to you. If you command select both of those clips and go to waveform over here. And because both of these play heads are synced up, you can then hit link right here. This link on link audio. By doing that, it has just basically said I want this audio from this separate audio file to be playing instead of the audio that was recorded on this camera for this angle. So now if I click this, it should be nice and clean and in sync. But you get the idea. So that is now going to be our master bass angle once we go to sync bin. And now the final thing I want to point out is all these clips right here, they're 3840 by 2160. They're huge 4k clips. I can't play these on my old 5k iMac from six years ago. So what I'm going to do is create proxies from them. Really simple to do that. I'm going to select them all. Okay, shift click them. I'm going to make sure I have my settings how I want for these. I'm going to be set to proxy media resolution and master settings to 1 eighth. This is going to make 480 by 270 clips based off of these. So pretty small and at ProRes proxy. But that's what I need to get them to playback smoothly. And to actually create them, it's super simple. We're just going to right click anywhere over here and we'll choose generate proxy media. And we'll see that thing start cooking. While resolve transcodes those files, I've got a video linked right here that will not only go over proxy workflow in more detail, but there's several other tricks that will help make DaVinci Resolve run smoother for you. Great. So our proxies are all cooked and we know that because we're in list view and we have information under the proxy column right here. And it says 480 by 270. That's our new resolution. But the way we make sure we actually use them is you go up to playback, use proxy media if available and check that box. Now everything's going to be buttery smooth. Let's jump to the cut pages sync them now. Shift three takes us there. And if we shift select the, you select the first one, then choose shift select gets the last one. And we're going to hit sync clips button right here. Okay. Now within here, you have timecode waveform in and out points to sync by we're going to choose waveform today and we're going to hit sync. And it's going to analyze the content. And I know you're worried, hey, maybe this is not going to work. Maybe you have this setup. So it is going to work because you've said everything perfectly. Let's find out what happens. And auto sync failed. Even after we had done those prep steps, it's still not working. What the heck? Let's click okay. I'm going to show you how to fix it. Click okay. You can adjust a couple of things right here in the sync clips window. And the way you can do that is make sure that you have the track selected here, this little camera icon on the one you want to adjust. And that's this first one that's out, obviously. So if you choose this button right here, it's unlocked sync. It's going to let you move it. So check that. Click and you can click and drag. And that's going to roughly place it into position. It's not great, but we're going to fix that in the next step. And by clicking save sync and going to the edit page, which is shift four, we now have a new little clip here that was created called media sync based off the date and time that it was done at. Here's the cool thing. You can right click on it, say open in timeline and boom. Just look at that over here. I'm going to hit shift Z to see our whole timeline and I'm going to shift scroll. So you can see it's basically, it looks just like a multicam clip. And it kind of is a multicam clip. The only exception is you can't really add angles in here and have them functional in the cut page. That's just disclaimer, a little warning, but we can adjust the sync in here and see everything which with much more precision because we can zoom in like crazy. So let's sync it up. We know the one that needs to work on is this V and a one. That's the unlocked one. So let's get towards where the beginning of the song is. We're going to hit shift and scroll with the mouse to get us in there. And then we're going to use option, which will center that play head up so that we can line this up. Here's the first downbeat. Here's our marker of that first downbeat with the drums. We're just going to get that lined up and we're going to be using the option scroll to get us there. And I'll move this over here, get us a little closer. Now that we're at this stage, we can maybe say, why don't we use the shortcut keys on our keyboard? There's a comma and a period key. And those will push things by one frame at a time. So I'm going to use the period key here to go to the right and kind of find where it looks best. I'm going to zoom in as far as I can and keep kind of adjusting it to where I think it's going to work best. And I think right there is going to be perfect because the loudest part of this waveform is right when that hits. And these are really crappy on camera scratch audio tracks. So that should be pretty much perfect. You can zoom out with shift Z shift Z and kind of preview how everything sounds. We can solo this right now if we want to preview it. Right. I think everything looks perfect. Now that you fixed everything with the media sync file, you have the option if you want to, you can come over here and rename it, call this fixed sync bin. And you can use that over in the cup page. Just make sure you're not adding angles here in this page because you're not going to be able to actually use those with a sync bin when you start editing and painting angles on in the next part of this video. Hey, I'm Chadwick. And if you made it this far, I just want to welcome you to creative video tips if this is your first time here. It's all about helping you create videos that make a difference and stand out. So if you're into that, click subscribe right now with the bell so you don't miss out on the new tip next week. I mean, why not? It's free. And I'm sure at this point you're wondering why even bother using the sync bin instead of the old traditional multicam method in the edit page. And three reasons I came up with R1. It's well, it's really fun to use the speed editor. Two, to color correct, you don't need to flatten anything like you do with the traditional multicam clip. And three, well, it's the new way that black magic design built to do the same old task of switching angles. So I can only imagine that this is going to get better as they develop it further. And no, this channel is not sponsored. I'm just a big fan. So now let's take a look at how to use this fixed up sync bin that we created with the speed editor over in the cut page. We're going to use the speed editor on a new empty timeline with our sync bin by calling up source that'll get our source tape. And we've got our clip here that has the good audio, the synced audio, maybe it's our field recording to find the input. We're going to hit jog to sort of see a refined view of those waveforms hit I on the keyboard or on the speed editor. We're going to hit scroll to go back out to do the zoomed out view hit jog again to go back in and see the detail hit out. And now we have a marked region that's going to work great. And we're going to append it to the timeline append is this button right here. We appended it down. We can hit timeline and we have a great base layer with our good sound. That's ready to sync everything to. Okay, so now that that's ready to go, we hit sync bin. It's right there. And we can see everything is synced up and ready to paint on. Now you want to only paint on the video portion of the angle. And the way we do that is there's a video only button right there. So we'll tap that. And so what that's done is we're not going to be putting down our bad scratch audio from the cameras or only could be using the audio that was synced on track one. Okay, now we just need to find an angle to put down there. Why don't we go to angle six right here and we'll hold down six cam six and rotate that. And it just basically paints it on. Okay, it's a it's all done with that search style. And if you want to see in the upper right window and sync bin, it goes from orange from one to six. So that's how you know what angle we're going to be seeing on the timeline. But if you want to see it full screen, you just hit timeline with the speed editor, hit play. Okay, and then you can see it full screen. Let's go back to sync bin because I want to show you next how to use live overwrite live overwrite this button right here. It's their live switching implementation. And what this does is it makes it so you don't have to hold the button down while you're scrolling. So let's say we want to go to the female vocalist five right there. That's Lindsay. We're going to hit five on there. And as soon as I start scrolling, it paints it on without me touching the cam buttons. Okay. And on top of that with live overwrite, these buttons here have little glowing lights. If you want to add a dissolve on the cut, you can hit that. And then when I choose the next angle, it's going to add the dissolve. So what if I wanted to go to keys from this angle, I would hit four. That's the key angle and it dropped the dissolve for me. And you just keep going real quickly. And what if I want to go back to one from here, back to six, you can see it's pretty quick to do that. To get out of live overwrite or the dissolve, you can just hit that button and it kind of goes away. And we can see those angles switching up there. And then if we want to preview them, we can hit timeline to see them full screen. Okay. And kind of shows time passing is kind of what cross dissolves to. But anyways, the big thing I really want to show you here that is super duper cool is the source overwrite button. Okay. Source overwrite in the manual says you have to have sync timecode, but I'm going to tell you, you actually don't. If you set everything up like you did for our sync bin today, you can use source overwrite. And so to use source overwrite, we're going to be calling a brush sync bin again. Okay. And this is going to kind of let us find a great moment from one of the angles at once at like in full screen. So let's look at camera angle eight. Okay. So I'm going to hit eight on the speed editor that lets us see everything full screen. And by default, it has marked a five second region of the clip. Maybe that's what we want, but maybe we want more or less than that. If you just want that, you just hit source overwrite and it has found the exact sync point on our timeline, hitting timeline again to where that that that clip goes. So if I hit play, sorry, let me pull that back right there. So nice little shaker action. But what if I don't want just that, that, you know, five second area, we can market however you want. So hit sync bin again, and let's, let's pick a different angle. Let's go to angle six. We want to see six full screen hit six right here. That lets us see it full screen. And I want that little squinting on the face right there. That's a good spot. I'm going to mark an eye with the speed editor. Mark an out and now hit source overwrite. And it just puts that smaller section, that region there on the timeline. So to see it, you hit timeline full screen. Okay. So that works good. And then the other thing to note about source overwrite that's really great to know is you can find like a boring part on your timeline and then go the reverse direction. So let's mark an end point there and an out point on the timeline. You can see those marks are set. And then I go back to sync bin and I want to fill that section with a different angle up there, but I don't want to mark the source. Let's say I want to use angle three. I'll hit three on there. And I'm going to clear the marks with tapping I know at the same time. Okay. That clears those marks. So the only marks we're seeing right now are actually down there on the timeline. Okay. And to drop that down, we're going to hit source overwrite. And it found the exact moment on the timeline that is in sync with that clip up above. So if I hit timeline, we can see we can go straight to that guitar close up. Pretty slick, right? So you can start with the source. You can start with the timeline. It's really flexible. And it's always going to call up that clip for you. And you don't even have to have sync timecode. So that's super, super handy. And this is really just the beginning. If you like this video, you should check out my DaVinci Resolve playlist right here. There's so much good stuff in it. And I also want to shout out Gileo Delatory who introduced me to the open and timeline tip. Sorry if I said your name wrong, but since there's so much more to learn, I will see you in that next video.
