Today I'm going to show you two tricks for reusing animate and keyframes for a DaVinci Resolve Fusion title graphic to also animate it out and off the screen. And here's the kicker. We're going to do this without adding any new keyframes for the outro. To get straight to the point and so you can follow along, I've provided a link in the description to download this free Fusion motion graphic. Once you download it, also install the Rubik font, which you can use for free from fonts.google.com on any project. Now open up Resolve and on the edit page, right click to create a new Fusion composition. Give the clip a name. I call this responsive reveal title and I'm leaving the frame rate at 24 FPS for this one. You can go higher if you want a smoother look. Click create and then right click on the title in the media pool to open it up in the Fusion page. If you're new to Fusion, don't worry, there are very few steps to make this work. The motion title I provided is simply a text file, a piece of Lua code, which is how Fusion works behind the scenes in DaVinci Resolve. Open this up in a text editor. I'm using text edit on a Mac and I think notepad is the windows equivalent. Let me know in the comments if it's not, but it looks scary, but just simply select it all with CMD or CTRL A. Copy it all and then on the Fusion page, click on the node flow area and hit CMD or CTRL V to paste this code in. And you should see all the nodes that make this work. Now you just need to make one connection. Click and drag from the gray outgoing merge to node to the yellow input of media out one. To see the animation on the Fusion page, click and drag the media out node into the viewer and you should be able to see and play it. Feel free to customize the text node by clicking on it, open the inspector and change the title. And if you need to change the size of the background box to fit your new text, click the rectangle node, then click the three dot menu to make sure you see a checkbox for show controls. And click and drag the green bounding box to fit. A quick side note here is that you do not want to be working in a DaVinci Color Managed project while doing Fusion graphics or your colors, they're not going to look right at all. This is a project setting that's not a default, but Color Managed workflows are huge for me. They're awesome. So I have a tutorial link below that's going to show you how to deal with that specific issue using render in place. And if you still want to use color management, you can go ahead and do it that way. Anyways, this is cool and all, but currently the title only animates in and I want to show you how to use the intro animation in to reverse and wipe off screen. So let's check out how to do this on the edit page first. Back in the edit page where most of us, myself included, are more comfortable, drag the Fusion title down to a timeline and then pro tip here, tap B to change to the blade tool. If you're coming from Final Cut Pro and love the skimmer, this is a little bit like getting two play heads the Final Cut has. Anyways, make a cut sometime after the intro animation has been completed. Select the back end static part of the clip and delete it. Now copy and paste the opening segment by option or alt dragging it to the right. At this point, you'd think you'd right click to change the speed to plane reverse, but you can't do that on a Fusion composition. So the trick is you right click on the clip and go up to new compound clip. Name it Outro and now you can change the clip speed by tapping R on the keyboard, which pulls up the clip speed dialog box and check the box for reverse speed. Now you can see we have both the animated intro and the outro working nicely. However, suppose you need the motion graphic title on screen longer. In that case, you need to trim out the left clip to extend that whole period, but you're constantly managing two graphic clips with this method, which can get messy if you need to modify the opening animation or anything else about the clip. So next I want to show you two simple node tools that you can add to this comp in Fusion so you can work with one single title clip and extend it as long as you need to. But before that, I want to say welcome and hi if you're new here to this channel. I'm Chadwick. This is Creative Video Tips. It's all about helping you create videos that make a difference and stand out. I love teaching tricks that aren't obvious to help you edit easier and eventually resolve, so if you're into that, subscribe right now, like right now, so you don't miss out on the next tip. Start fresh from the media pool by right clicking on the Fusion comp and opening it on the Fusion page. Start by clicking in an empty area of the node flow so nothing is selected. Hit Shift-Space-Bar to pull up the Tools list. The first tool we need to add is called TimeSpeed, so type that in and click to add it. Then click the empty space again. Hit Shift-Space-Bar and add the tool called Dissolve. In a nutshell, TimeSpeed will reverse the composition and Dissolve is going to control a switch for when we want the reversal to happen with a straightforward expression that you can copy and paste from the description. So to connect these two nodes up, start by disconnecting Merge2 from the media out by clicking on the right side of the connection pipe when it turns blue. You'll lose the viewer here, but don't sweat it. Let's connect the TimeSpeed and Dissolve. Drag the output of Merge2 to the yellow input of TimeSpeed. Next, drag the gray output of TimeSpeed to the yellow input of Dissolve. You'll probably see the input knots move all around. Don't worry, that's normal and doesn't affect the behavior at all. Now also drag the output of Merge2 to the green input of Dissolve. This is the power of node-based compositing right here. And finally, drag the gray output of Dissolve to the yellow input of media out. Click to play this and you'll see nothing has happened yet. We just have two parameters to change. Click to open the inspector if it isn't already and click on the TimeSpeed node. Change the speed to negative one. Now click the Dissolve node and we're going to add an expression to the background foreground parameter, which is going to tell the output when to pay attention to the background inputs, the yellow lines, or the foreground inputs, the green lines. To add the expression, hover your mouse over the words background to foreground, right click and choose expression. In this new little box, delete the number one and type in the following. IIF, open parentheses, open parentheses, comp.renderend-time, close parentheses is less than open parentheses, comp.renderend, divided by two, close parentheses, comma zero, comma one, and then you close the parentheses. And hit return to lock it in. Tap the space bar to preview it and you should see it animate in and out. It can be easy to mistype this so feel free to copy and paste this from the video description. If you're curious what this means at all, the first part before the comma says, if this part is true, then return zero as the result for the Dissolve, but if it isn't, then return one. Now over in the edit page, drag this modified title onto the timeline and you can see that you can shorten or lengthen this clip to your heart's content. Just make sure you do it from the back end of the clip. One thing that's helped me out a ton as I've been learning to transition from creating titles in After Effects to DaVinci Resolve Fusion has been using MotionVFX plugins. MotionVFX is not sponsoring this video, but since the built-in Fusion graphics that come with Resolve, they're kind of lame, and we always need new stuff in a pinch because we don't always have enough time to build a new title from scratch. They gave us the code CVT15 to use it checkout for 15% off your order. I've got an affiliate link below, which is a great way you can help support this channel, and you still get the discount with the code CVT15. So I think this offers just for limited time, so I jump on it now before it's too late. Anyways, if you've seen any creative video tips before, you've seen me use this subscribe animation from their M-Tuber pack on almost every video since it came out. But one of the newest title packs that I'm digging is M-TitleHype. These presets work entirely on the edit page, so they're super simple to customize in the inspector, and they come with a checkbox for animating in and out. But hopefully, just like this title says, nothing is impossible. Now you have a great grasp of the possibilities with using MotionGrafx in DaVinci Resolve. Let me know down in the comments if you'd like to see more basic Fusion tips as I'm learning them, and I've got a great playlist that's popping up on screen right now with what YouTube thinks you're going to enjoy, and because there's so much more to learn, I'll see you in that next video. Thank you so much for watching.
