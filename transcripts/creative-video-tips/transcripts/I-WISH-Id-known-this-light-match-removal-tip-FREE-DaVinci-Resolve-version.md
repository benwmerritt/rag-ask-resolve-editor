I know what you're thinking, this is not about the object removal or the patch replacer tool that's in the paid version of Resolve. The results of those tools are often unpredictable and they're just hard to control. This is actually a proven workflow that I've adapted from Nuke in diffusion and only using the tools that are in the free version of DaVinci Resolve for removing things like a logo off of a bus with like a handheld shaky camera shot that even has lighting changes. This sticks out and this is a problem. This would not fly. If you'd like to follow along, I'm providing the S-Log3 clip that I shot. It's available over at creativevideotips.com as part of joining the cutting club along with the project file. Chapter markers we're covering today is going to be a linear workflow set up for Fusion, how to send the still frame into Photoshop and do some painting. So if you can paint on a still image in any program, you're going to be good to go. How to use the built-in planar tracker in more ways than one. And then the big headline tip that's going to make this tutorial for sure worth bookmarking. How to use the Probe modifier to channel by channel by channel frame by frame, automate it in an exposure correction to match the cleaned up still image so that it matches the background video over time. Oh and there's even a double polygon masking tip to polish it out even further at the end. So I'm working with this clip today. It will shot with the Sony a7-4 if you're wondering. It has a logo, a blue logo on the back there and a common thing that is commonly asked in advertising is to either blur out logos or completely remove them for either legal reasons or creative reasons. So shift 5 gets us into Fusion and if you've watched some of my tutorials you'll know I like to work top down. The way I get there is workspace, layout presets, Fusion presets, mid-flow. That gives me a top down approach and I just want the right view or some closing, the left one. And then I do have to do a little bit of housekeeping to get the top down from media in one. If anyone knows a way to get this to go top down from the start, let me know. Let's start with adding a color space transform tool to this to sort of normalize it so we can actually see like what the image really supposed to look like. But also to get it into sRGB linear space, which is what Fusion uses here internally. And the linear parts really important for compositing. So let's load that up, shift space, gets a CST node. As soon as we've done that, if you want to see the results of a node in Fusion, just pick and flick, drags it up here. And as soon as you pick and flick it, you'll see that's the results of the node at that state in the flow. Now over on the right, we have input color space, input gamma. This tells us or this tells resolve what the thing was shot with and then it knows how to do the math to convert it. So the input color space for this specific clip is going to be sony sgamma3.cine. And then the gamma was slog3, which is going to be really common on any current sony cameras if they're shooting 10 bit that sort of thing. And then the output color space, this doesn't make a big difference here, but it's going to be sRGB linear. And then tone mapping, what I'm going to do here is a it's a round trip workflow. So I'm going to convert this so that I can see and work on it. And then I'm going to reverse it to go back out to the edit page. So it's like I've never done anything to it afterwards, except the logo replacement here, where I'm going to take out this blue gray line logo here. Okay. So to do that, one thing I'm going to do is remove the tone mapping, say none on there. And I do want to apply a forward OTF so that I can see things nicely. The other thing you're going to look at me in here be like, Hey, this is super dark now. This is actually what linear looks like without the gamma correction. But Fusion has a nice solution for this. It's built in, it's right up here. It's called the gamut view lots. Okay, if you check that, this is applying like a lot just on your display output to match your monitor. So your monitor that you're looking at when you're compositing is probably sRGB. So the way you modify the settings for all this is there's an edit button right there, click that. And you can take and control everything from here. So the source base, I was working with ACES CG before, I guess this doesn't matter because I'm not dealing with that. But we're going to be sRGB going out to sRGB, and we're adding the gamma the gamma is the important part here. So you can just sort of see what this looks like when it's brought back to a normal representation, right? Now to get this back to the edit page. So it looks like we haven't done any work. See this over here, it's all dark. That's no good. To get this back out to the edit page, you want to reverse this. So we're basically making, I call it a CST sandwich, you know, it's a color management sandwich. So we'll take this one, command C, command V makes a copy of it. And the nice thing about the resolve transform here, as it has this button right here, swap. It's really nice and handy thing you hit it, and it just reverses your inputs outputs. It also changes your OOTF. So now we're back to where we started, and we have this little playground right here in the middle to do all of our work. So let's take a look at getting a reference still image here to actually paint on over in Photoshop. You could use affinity photo, any of those. The main thing is you want to find a frame here that's going to be a reference for tracking. So just pick a frame that you like, we'll just keep this simple, we'll start on frame zero down here. And we're going to export a still of just this frame. The way you do that at Fusion is you right click anywhere on the viewer, control click, and you have a button here, save image should bring up a dialog box, it did pick a good location for it. I've got a folder here called demo footage. And then within here, I like to call it what the shot is that I'm working on. So this is frame, FR zero, and then there you go, I'm going to hit save. And so that's exported a float 32 EXR image that we can work with in Photoshop. As you open the EXR in Photoshop, you'll have the option about transparency, there is none. So click OK, not a big deal. And you'll see the image looks basically the same as it does over in Fusion. It's one of the reasons I like to export an EXR file instead of a PNG or some other format. But there's some things you got to deal with because the EXR is inherently linear. But being 32 bit float, it's not going to work with some of the patch tools that remove tools that you might love and be familiar with. So we're going to deal with that. But first, I want to show you under the edit menu, there is a setting here called color settings command option K. And the checkbox I think is really important to check, at least that works good for me is blend RGB colors using gamma 1.0, make sure that's checked. And then everything else is s RGB. Okay, from here on, we're going to convert the color space to actually get to use these fancy tools, including content to where fill, you know, generative AI stuff with image mode, changes to 16 bits per channel. So as you do that, it's going to want to merge these together and tone map it, we do not want to do that, do not merge right here. Okay, that would be a mistake. We're going to say, don't merge. And you can see we've changed to a 16 bit file, that's not floating point, it's just 16 bit to clone on this, this is going to be a quick one, I'm not going to go into detail. There's a lot of better Photoshop tutorials out there, I'm gonna hit command J to make a new layer and work on that. Z to move into the, the gray line here, this logo I'm going to remove. And I'm going to start with trying the patch tool. It's great one, just sort of drawing a lasso around the object I want to remove, and find a sample of what I want to clone with. And I'm just trying to line up that line a little bit. I'm not going to do perfect because tutorial command D, hey, that's not too bad. I'll just say that's good and done for my purposes. I've zoom out to one, it's like it's totally gone. Now we can use this over infusion. I personally like to do two things, one I like to keep a working, you know, copy of this. So I've got my cleaned up version on the top layer here in the original. I'm just overprotective about keeping stuff. So I hit save, I was going to save as a PSD, that's the layered version, right? From here, I want to save this back as an EXR to pull back an infusion. And to save it as an EXR back out of here after you've done your work, you actually need to go back to your mode and change it back to a 32 bit channel image. Okay. So as you do this, again, we're not going to merge, don't merge. Now you're going to have the option under save a copy to save as an open EXR file. And because I've done work on this, and if you've done much before with clients, you're going to have multiple, multiple versions. I'm going to do underscore v 001. It's going to save and it's going to ask us what kind of compression to use. That's what EXR has these great compression formats, I'm going to use the Zlib format. That's the most similar that I found to what Fusion by default sends out. Click okay. And it has saved a super quick way to get that still plate back into here is I'm just going to open my finder window at the same time, find it in my list here, this is going to be the frame one that I just exported, drag it right on in. It makes it as a new media in one. And you can see there's a cleaned up version. There's our video version. So now I'm going to show you how do we get this to move match color and even add grain at the end. We have some movement of the camera and the buses. It's not moving a lot, but it is moving a little bit. And I'm going to track this based off of the first frame, that's going to be our reference. That's the most important thing is your clean plate that you make the one over as your still image needs to be the same as your reference frame. Well, to get a planar tracker down here in the flow, anywhere you click is where it's going to drop. So I like to sort of pre click shift space. P t r a is our planar tracker. And to track something you have to send an input into us. We're going to go out of the color space transform into here. Now it'll default going into the yellow input. Again, these move around the position of nodes and fusion does not matter. And to get to start using this, I'm going to load this pick and flick this over into the window. And we have all these tools up here, which let us draw out a shape and then so resolve can use this shape to figure out the movement of the shot. You can use that in a couple ways. I'm going to show you. So a few rules about drawing polygons on here for planar tracking. You don't want to include lights, things that would change. You don't want to include reflections. You just want to include the same planar surface that the things on. So I'm just drawing, you know, a pretty loose random shape, you can see. And I'm not getting the lights because those are going to throw things off. But the idea is there's check texture in here that's going to get tracked over the time. And we can apply that now that we have a closed up shape, we can we can start trying to track it. Tracking controls are held over here. And we have reference time, reference time on this again, this is going to be our still image frame that we had tracked that's that's going to be ground zero. So we're going to say set on that. And we're going to say the tracker type. There's a lot of tracking tutorials out there that's not what this is totally about. There's a lot about is the lighting change. So I'm going to change this to hybrid point area. And Casey Ferris has a lot of really good ones. And I would point you to probably his channel for those. And a motion type, this drop down here is important. And the idea here is all of these are in order of how complex the information you get out of them will be. Perspective is the most information. And it's usually needed for things like a phone or something that's that's moving in perspective. This shot probably is moving in perspective, but not so much. And the idea is if you have trouble with these, these lower ones, try the one that's higher and you might get a more solid results. They're more sensitive as you go down the list. And the worst thing you want is bad tracking data that you're having the correct. So the more solid you can get your track the better. I know on this because I ran it already. And once your time, we're going to choose the shear option, which is the second one down there. And we'll just leave everything else as defaults. And I'll zoom out just a little bit and we'll start running the track by putting pushing this button right here. And unfortunately, you really don't have an idea how well the track is going like you do in Mocha Pro as it's going. The way you check the track afterwards, I mean, you could see if the shape went crazy, it probably didn't do well. But the way you always check a track with the planar tracker in here, as you go over to steady, and this stabilize the area that you had your shape on. And then so the idea is I want to stabilize or see how well this area is here where the logo is, by just placing your cursor on a point on there, and then playing the image. If it's not moving, like left, right up and down and skewing out crazy, you have a pretty good track. So just right off the start, we have a decent track that we can use further down the line. How do we use it? That's what I'm going to show you next. So let me pause. We have a decent track. There is the first way is going to be let's go back to the track operation mode. There's a what's called the planar transform button right here. And what planar transform does, let's click it, it dropped a new node over here in my flow. The planar transform, if you're used to Mocha Pro from After Effects or something, it's basically the same as like a line surface out of there. It's taking the entire resolution frame and mapping it based off of the reference frame. In fact, if you click the planar transform, you'll see over here on the upper right, if you forget what the reference frame you set was, it's based off the frame zero. So that's the first frame, it's the one we drew everything on. So what frame zero, it fills the frame, there's no distortion. Every frame after it's going to distort. Let me show you how you apply this. So you're going to basically run your image through it, you're going to take media out the still image, right? This is our still that's cleaned up on frame zero, it matches our footage, right? See, now to hook this up, you take the output of the still image, put this into the planar transform. And now if you take a look at this, it's actually moving the whole image in the exact same way that the footage underneath it's moving. But none of the other people are. So I'm going to show you, we're basically going to mask that out next. But we will merge our clean plate on top. So to merge on top, let's grab a merge tool, I'm going to hit Shift Space, MRG gets a merge tool to put it in the flow. This is another tip, hold down Shift, drag it in until you get that yellow blue line. And it snaps in. So we're taking the background input from our footage, our main footage, and we're going to put the still image on top. Okay, this is the beauty of nodes. Love it. But it's always running through the planar transform. So now when I take a look at it, we're seeing the whole image is doing some jiggle. So you can see it's not not the best track in the world, but it's going to be good enough for this. However, we just want to see the middle section, we just want to see the cutout. And so we'll mask that off. And the way I'm going to mask it off, there's a few ways you can pump a mask right into the media end. But because we're going to do color correction and stuff, it's better if you separate it out, and you cut the mask out later down the flow. That's what I like to do. And there's a lot of ways you can mask this out. So what the way I'm going to do it is I'm going to use what's called a channel Boolean. So shift space and then BOL channel Boolean's with an S is the one we want. And then this has a special mask input as well. And it only takes one input. That's why I like to use it. Then we can use this to draw the mask and cut it out. So to actually see what we're drawing on, I'm going to load up the color space transform. Okay, on the reference frame. So I know where I want this mask to be, I'm going to grab a B spline. That's this guy right here. With that down, and that loaded, so I can see where to draw, I'm just going to click out of shape. That's pretty simple. Around the logo that we moved over in Photoshop, shift O closes it. And you can see the B splines, do they do this rounded curve, which is really, really handy, without having to deal with handles. And the other thing I was going to point out, and do is every time it automatically has keyframes on it, I don't need that because I've got this thing, it's a still image, it doesn't move. So we don't need that. You go over here, right click, say remove B spline one polyline. And now it's not going to move over time. And to plug this in to actually cut this out, take this, and we're going to play this into the mask input. Which because it's a mask kind of new where to go, it doesn't do anything though until you go to the settings tab. And all of these that have these, these mask inputs pretty much all have this multiply by mask button. As soon as you hit that, it cuts it out. So if I take a look at the image here now, we're just looking at the cutout from here. Right. So instead of applying it at this point, we're applying it later. This is because we're going to do color correction before we multiply our mask. Let's take a look at where we're at in the flow now. So we have our zoom out a little bit. So we have our patch apply that we created over in Photoshop. And it's kind of working. It's tracking along. But what happens to the image over time when the light gets brighter, you can see what is it right around here. Because the surrounding pixels have gotten brighter, this sticks out. And this is a problem. This, this would not fly for pretty much anyone saying that's a good replacement. So we're going to do some automatic color correction to this next. You might think when color correction, you're going for the color corrector node, the curves node, and those do have some automatic color tools. But what I want to show you today is a technique that I picked up from from Vito's channel from like nine years ago, using the probe tool. So I'm going to color correct based off of our still image. So I'm going to just color correct this whole thing here to match the light flicker that's in the video. We're going to do that with a series of nodes. The first one that's going to link to a probe is going to be called color gain, shift space, color, I don't even know the name of it. There it is, CLR color gain. Okay, this color gain tool, we're going to be using the gain sliders here to look at a probe that we're going to be setting up. Now, the probe modifier is really cool, because what it does is it takes like a pixel, and it can analyze it and give you the values of that pixel or even an area. And so for this sort of thing, we're going to look at the values, the RGB values of a whole area. The way you can set that up so that it's controllable in individual channels is actually on the color gain tool itself. If you right click on any of these, this is just a fusion tool thing, you can say edit controls. And this is going to let you add new parameters to it. I'm going to add one that's called my probe. And this is going to ask where do we want it placed? Well, I want it placed on the same one as this gain control, so I'll choose gain. And I want it to be a slider control, sure. As soon as I click OK, it adds a new parameter down here that can be modified. This is how you can control new things in here. To actually add the modifier, though, you right click on that parameter, and I say modify with probe. Okay, modify with probe. As soon as you do that, a new tab appears up at the top. If we take a closer look at the modifier over here in the inspector, it's first asking for an image to probe. So what do we want to probe? Well, we want to probe the footage, right? We want to get the pixel information from this background footage, especially the area around where the replacement is, where that light is flickering. But it's moving. And so the other way we're going to use the planar tracker today is in a stabilized view. So just like we used at the steady view to check how good the track was, you can also use the steady mode to sort of lock it off. And this is going to be useful for us in this case as well. So operation mode now, we're going to change instead of from the track, it still has the information we need, but we'll change it to steady, which means when we look through here, this area is locked off. So I don't have to like roto a position of a box for the probe to get the light information. I hope that makes sense. But so let's get that information into the color gain modifier, image to probe. And the way you can load something in here anytime it has these little boxes, you can just click hard, drag it, and then release. And it takes the name of that tool and puts it right there. So it's saying the probe is going to look at that image. And I want it to be a rectangle instead of a specific point. When I made it a rectangle, you'll see the rectangle box popped up here. It's much too large. And I'm going to position this right over the center of here. An ideal candidate would be like sort of a gray area that is taking, you know, values evenly. This, this will work fine on this, this particular example. But if there was a lot of crazy contrast, you might put it just to the side or something. And then as far as the channels, this is saying, what are we actually going to be probing? This is looking at the red channel initially, I just want to look at the Luma values, the brightness values. And that thing is pretty much set up to go and give us some values. And you should be able to see we have some numbers that are moving. And that's the Luma values that are coming off of the probe. And we're going to be able to use those in the gain sliders right up here. What I'm going to do is I'm actually going to connect these red, green, blue channels to the probe output by right clicking on red, connect to probe one, red, and then you just go to green, right click, connect to probe one, green, you get the idea of blue, connect to probe one, blue. And now you have basically multiplied, you know, gain is a multiplier, based off of the color values from that modifier probe. You can see it is, it is in fact flickering, but it's all dark. And so the way you get this back, based off of a reference frame, again, we talk about frame zero is our reference, is you actually apply a lock in a white point for that frame with these values. And the way you can do that with the tools that are built into here without doing anything extra is you're gonna I'm going to do this with three brightness contrast nodes, okay, shift space, BC. Now that we've got one there, I'm going to hit command C, command V, command C, command V, you get the idea is three in a row. And the reason there's three is I'm going to do one per channel. So I'm going to, you have these high and low values here, this is what's going to allow us to lock off a white point is the high value. So to actually see multiple nodes at once, if you if you didn't know, you can click the node that you want to see all the time, there's a little pin button up here. So if I click pin here, that's going to be useful because I can go to my first one here, and my first brightness and contrast, and still always see this tool available, because what you're going to do is you're going to copy and paste the red value, command C, and I'm going to paste that into the high value of the first brightness contrast on the frame. This is the important part on the frame that your still image was painted on, because that's the one that matches the background footage. And then I just want to apply this to the red channel only. Okay, now you go to the next one. So what do you think we're going to do? The green channel next. So on the next brightness and contrast, I'm going to copy the value on that frame, that's the reference frame, into the second brightness of contrast, the high value, paste, and you're going to hit return or whatever to lock it in. And this one's green only. So I'm unchecking everything but green. The next one, we got blue. So we'll take the blue channel, copy that value, go to the high point. I'm still on the green. I'll go to the other one. So now I'm on the third one. High point, paste. And this one is blue only. And then if you take a look at the color gain, you should see, if you did this correctly, you'll see a matching image from this color gain to your media and one, those should look the same for the reference frame. But now you've applied an animated color correct over time that will pick up the, you know, everything from the probe to see it in action, you can click the merge, that's your comp, right? Let me zoom this out so you can see the whole thing a little better. So we've got media in RGB, white points, color gain with probe, we've cut it out. And we did all the color correction before we cut it out was important. Then we move it with the planar transform right before it goes into merge. Now if you take a look, we've drastically improved that patch right there. It is still slightly visible. And we're going to take care of that with a couple other steps of modifying that mask. But if you look at all of this without the color gain, or if I select those nodes and hit command P, you can see it has gotten us very far, very quickly, you know, without without having to manually go in and dial in gain values on every channel to get that thing to match. Now, the cool thing about masks infusion, one of the cool things, is on the B spline itself, I'm going to click that is you actually have two softness values. So if I pick and flick this over into this area over here, you can see there is up here soft edge, by the way, we don't need this pin anymore. So I'm going to get rid of the color gain, and just take a look at the B spline. You have a soft edge here, which is which is basically sort of blurring out the edge in both directions. But it's all the way around. You also have control with what's called a double polygon, but they're a little bit tricky to understand how to set up and use. And so I'm going to show you the way that I work with them. And so why don't we go to our frame right here, so we can sort of see what we're working with on the image itself, it doesn't have to be loaded, but it does need to be selected, right click, and then you can say, polyline, done. Meaning, I don't want to move those points. Okay, but I do want to add a double poly like it right here, this button right here, this little special thing is called the double poly. So this is the double poly section you've made it to in the video. Congratulations. On the double poly, I don't want to add new points as well. So if you right click down here, we now have an outer poly, and this one I want to choose to modify only. Now that we've done that, it should have automatically selected those points, the outer polygon, and you can pull those out. So it's creating a feather. I take a look here, you can see what it's doing. It's creating a feather that I'm controlling how much that is bleeding. And so if you look at the comp version, and you want to look at a different frame or something, where maybe you sort of saw an edge, this is how you can blend that a little bit smoother, you know, and you have the ability to use soft edge and the double poly at the same time to get a better result. So that that looks pretty good to me. I think it's that's pretty, pretty invisible for, for a logo replacement. However, you can do even better. So this image right here has no grain on it, and the footage has been de noise. That's important thing to start with. All video footage probably should have grain on it. So that's a great last step. It's another free tool that's in Fusion. So shift space, film grain FGR is going to put some grain over the top of everything. And that blends that in too. So it's like you never even knew that was there. It's very strong to start. So what I would typically do is I would take the size and just, just pull this down. And if you feel like you want to have finer control, if you hold down command when you drag, it gives you, you know, more control. And it just needs, it just needs a touch. If you want to see a quick before and after of what that where this came from, maybe even before the grain, let's look at the merge result right here. You have buffers. I've talked about this before. We're in the a buffer. If you go to the B buffer, there's nothing in it, we could send our original color space transform over there. Oh, and I'm glad it is because the other thing to know is these buffers have their own gamut viewer. So you got to turn that on for both buffers and make sure that they're set correctly. In fact, I want to show you so you don't have to set that every time if you right click on these, you can say settings, save default. So next time I go to add that, I don't have to change that from ASUS, I can get annoying. And the smooth resize was turned on for that, but not the other to see the split buffer split wipe. And option command click in there. And that takes you gets you that point option command click. So you don't have to go find it somewhere else and drag it all around. And so you can quickly check your work to see, is it invisible what we did? I think it's pretty damn good. I think it's pretty darn good. I'll say that. And then when you go back out to the edit page, you'll see because we had this inside this CST sandwich, this color management sandwich. We should be looking at the s log three s game at cine footage, like we had never touched it before. And if you take a look a little closer, you can turn off up here, turn off your fusion effects. And it's just like we added it in there and it blends super nicely. So it's a very good non destructive workflow. Real quick, one last thing that I forgot to turn on earlier, but it's really important anytime you move something that is still is to turn on motion blur. So the planar transform tool itself is the thing that's moving this, right? But there's no motion blur on by default, you need to click the planar transform, go to settings. And then you've got the motion blur tab right there. And you can see this is going to blend it much nicer turn the quality up to 10 because who wants a quality of two I mean, for real. And then once you see your final output, it will match the shutter angle and everything. And it'll blend much, much nicer. And so basically these three brightness contrast nodes with the color gain is essentially the curves tool from Nuke. If you're used to Nuke at all, this is how you can match exposure for clean plates. I got a lot of help with this one. The original idea came from Vito who has the confusion YouTube channel. But he's using an expression and expressions crash the probe right now. I think it's been broken for a little while. And I learned that from Milo Labs who has also been super helpful in figuring all this out, as well as Brian Ray, who's the one that pointed me on to the idea of using the edit controls to add the extra parameter and then link the probe RGB values to that. These guys are brilliant. There's so many people out there sharing great information. I'm Chadwick, I am a DaVinci Resolve master trainer, but I'm learning so much from everyone like you. And because there's so much more to learn. I'll see you in the next video.
