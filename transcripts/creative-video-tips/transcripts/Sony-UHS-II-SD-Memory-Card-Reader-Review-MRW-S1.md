So last week I realized there's a way to import my videos three times faster than I've been doing for years and that's getting a UHS2 card reader. Today I'm talking about this one. It's the Sony MRWS1. Let's get into it. Hey, if you're new here, my name is Chadwick. This is creative video tips where I help you create videos that make a difference and stand out. If that's the sort of thing you're into, click subscribe right now so you don't miss my next tip. Okay, so UHS2. Everyone talks about it. It's in all these new cameras. In fact, if you've bought a camera in the last two or three years, these are probably a UHS2 card slot in it. And I didn't really understand what UHS2 was until I was looking into ways to save time when I'm importing my footage. If you're like me, I've been using a Transcend USB3 card reader, which I figured USB3, they're all fast, right? They're as good as you're going to get and faster cards are going to go faster over a USB3 pub or port on your computer. Well, what I've learned is, so this one was like eight bucks I bought it five years ago, is that there's a such thing as a UHS2 card reader. Your card reader matters. Your card reader definitely matters. So on these new UHS2 cards, which you do need a UHS2 card for it to work. So here is a Sony Tough One that I have. They're a little different than the old ones. These new ones, they have two rows of pins. So there's one on top and one on bottom. If you invest in the cards, make sure you invest in an UHS2 card reader, because you're not going to be able to take advantage of those extra pins and those extra pins and the card reader together is what is the magical thing that makes your imports go so much faster. And I'm talking like two and a half to almost three times faster on your imports. So we're talking like an hour of video maybe takes you 20 minutes to import. And if you're like me, you don't have enough time ever in your life. So if you're able to save that 40 minutes from a shoot, I mean, that's more time you could spend making proxies or being creative editing or spending time with your family. So that's why I think getting a UHS2 card reader like this one is great. And the other thing that's great about the UHS2 cards and the card readers is the backwards compatible. So you can use these. I've got this cool little wallet card holder. I can use a UHS1 card, which again, if you check out my UHS1 card, it just has one row of pins where UHS2 has two. I'll do a separate video that compares and talks about the difference in SD cards because that's a whole nother topic. What I really want to get across is the importance of if you're using UHS2 cards, get a UHS2 card reader. This one cost me about 25, 27 bucks off Amazon. I'm super excited about this time saving thing that costs like next to nothing. Everyone's like looking what's the next way to make better videos and creative things. And it's like, you know, if you save time, then you have more ability to be more creative or to shoot more or to edit more or to think of other ideas of going different places to create things. So let's jump into the computer and I'll show you real quickly with I've got Blackmagic Speedtest open and then we'll do a file copy comparing the Transcend USB3 card reader, which I've had for five years. It's UHS1 and then we'll compare it to the Sony MRWS1. Ugreen, which is a real popular one, they make one as well and it has a micro SD slot. So that's another great option. I just like the form factor of these things. They have like a little USB style stick and then they slide right in. I use a hub. So one complaint about this one in particular is it's a little wider than some of the other. So if you're just going next to other ports, it could potentially block them. But because of the I use like a seven port hub, USB hub, it doesn't get in the way at all. Okay, let's plug her in. Let's start first with the old reader. So this is the old Transcend UHS1 card reader, which will get these Sony Tough Card. This is a UHS2 64 gigabyte V90 card that's plugged into my USB hub. We'll see it come up here on the computer in a sec. Hopefully. There it goes. So we've got untitled here. This has, let's see, we're looking at 20 gigs of data. So a decent amount, not a ton, but it'll give us a good test to compare them. So this has a should have a combination. So we've got a whole bunch of different clips. So it's not one continuous file. We've got 72 different video clips we're going to be testing out. And first we're going to try the Blackmagic speed test. This is a free tool from DaVinci or from Blackmagic Design that makes DaVinci. And we'll do a five gigabyte write test and we'll say select target drive, which will be our untitled. UHS2 card and we'll say start. And there it goes. So this is using the UHS2 card with the transcend UHS1 card reader. So this is what I've been using for five years or something like that. So you can see here, we've got 88, 90 megabytes per second. That's what we're getting out of that reader. Let's get it out and see what we get with the new Sony MRWS1 card reader, which is new to me, but it's been out a couple of years. I just didn't know about it. And I think there's probably some other people like you, maybe they don't know about it. So let's check it out. Dropping in my hub to the iMac over USB3 hub. And we're going to select our drive again, make sure we're hitting the right spot. The middle is the drive and we're going to click start. And look at that. So we were at 80, 90 megabytes per second. Now our right speeds all of a sudden are at 214 on a relatively new card, but still those are insane. And look at this, the read speed, 264 megabytes per second. So what this means, you have a fast SSD external drive you've got plugged in also over USB3. Take advantage of those speeds for sure. So we just saw 217 megabytes, 264 here it is like 253 megabytes per second. Now this is a tool, right? This is a testing tool. Let's actually copy the files, the 20 gigabytes and see how long it takes with a stopwatch running. I'm curious. So we've got a desktop. I've got this folder called UHS to copy. And this is the card and it has 20 gigs in it approximately. And as soon as I drag, I am going to be hitting start. So and drop start. And here we go. Here's a progress saying about a minute. We'll see how close it is to actually be a minute. And the race is on. I think one thing I love speed when editing is because I was never a fast runner. I was never fast in school. So if I can do things faster on a computer and faster than other people, makes me feel good inside. I don't know if you're like that. I probably should cut that, but I probably won't. All right, here we go. We're at 37 38 seconds and we're a little past halfway. So and this is again, we're looking at the Sony UHS to card reader and it's cranking along. And this one is a 27 bucks right now in Amazon. So really cheap compared to the cameras that we're buying, right? Here we go. It's going, it's going, it's going. It seems like it's slowing down here a little bit at the end. That's why I had a varied length of clip and ready and stop. Okay. One 16 is what I got on that one. Okay. One 16. We're going to do the same thing with the transcend card reader. Same card. We'll see how long it takes. Here we go with UHS one card reader and this is the footage again. And we're going to do just a full card dump. I've got my timer set. So as soon as I drag this private folder onto here, I'm going to say go, go. And we're off to the races. Okay. I think the last one was at UHS to copy what was the UHS to copy. Okay. I think the last one was at UHS to copy was about a minute 16. This is already telling me right here on the desktop. It's saying like three minutes, three minutes. Like that's, it's like almost three times slower, three minutes for those 20 gigs. So you can see pretty quickly here. If you have, you know, the other day I shot four and a half hours of footage. If I did that without this UHS to card reader, I'd be up all night. And that's not fun. That is not fun. So we'll just let this time out here and see how this nets. So we get an accurate number on the test. We are almost done. Almost done. And stop. Okay. 336. Call it 337. Whatever you want to say. This is one freaking fast card reader. If you got any value out of this video, please click like and leave a comment. If you are on the fence about what card readers are working great and what cards you're using, I want us all to be able to share so we can learn from each other. I appreciate you so much and thank you for watching this video. And I'll see you in the next one.
