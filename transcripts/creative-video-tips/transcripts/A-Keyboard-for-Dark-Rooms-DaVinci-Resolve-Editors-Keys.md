## Transcript
Avid Agility is one of my favorite books on video editing. Years ago, I studied it, I practiced it, and I studied it again, and then I could comfortably cut with a dozen creatives in the room behind my back. This book right here helped me to learn to navigate the editing software like I was a virtuoso playing an instrument in a symphony orchestra. Once you no longer need to start thinking about what button to press and you can just feel it, video editing becomes super fun and not a technical task. But how can we actually get that muscle memory and DaVinci Resolve? Well, simple practice, but it has to be intentional practice. And this brand new editor's keys keyboard, it's a good cheat sheet for clicking less and cutting more without even studying a book. The shortcut labeled keys on here have even helped me discover a feature that I had personally forgotten about that's called quick trim. And that lets you trim and move shots with the command and control J and L keys just like this. You might have already realized JKL is your navigation and almost any editing software L takes you to the right to play, you can double tap it to move even faster, and then J will take it backwards. But what I had forgotten about or didn't realize until I got this keyboard that has this slip perf stop dynamic trim button on it, is that it can actually be used for trimming as well. You just hold down command or control on a PC while you're using your J and L buttons. So let me show you how that works. If I select an edit point here on the timeline, I will just select this one right here, and you can option shift select it, when lasso it, that's one way I like to use with the stylus. But if you wanted to go all keyboard, you could just hit V on the keyboard, it'll take you there. And if you wanted to roll this clip, you can see we have both sides of the edit point are selected, you would hold and I wanted to go to the right, I would hold down command and L because L is to the right of K. And you can see without doing anything else, I'm actually moving that edit point to the right. This is a rolling edit, which means it's taking away frames from one side and it's giving the exact same frames to the other side. And if I want to stop that, I have no hands on the keyboard, it's just trimming by itself, I hit K, and it stops. So it's going 100%. If you want it to go faster, you just double tap it. And if you want to go the other direction, command J, and now I've kicked off this trim, see no hands on the keyboard, it's going the other direction. So it could be a quick way to sort of extend shots to sort of see the full length of a clip like these drone shots here are super, super long. So that's a good example of why you might want to use that. Now, beyond that, the rolling trims and stuff like that, if I wanted to ripple trim it like a final cut pro timeline is by default, the magnetic timeline, go to trim mode. And that is this button right here. Okay, but it's also T on the keyboard for trim. Now, if I do a trim, what that's going to do is it's going to push everything out out of the way if I select the correct edge of the clip right here. So if I hit U, and I want to push all that other stuff out now, I hold command L, and you can see how I'm pushing the rest of those clips out and out of the way. So I'm not adding and subtracting frames, I'm just adding frames and making the timeline longer. Okay, to stop it. Now, to take this a step further, you can actually use this to actually move clips around on the timeline independently of the edit points. So the way that would work, go back here to selection mode. If you don't want to do a slipper slide, which is for another tutorial, you could select the clip and then hit command L. And look at this, I'm moving this down the timeline, no hands, right? It's like when you're riding a bike with no hands. So I'm moving that down that way. And if you want to get away from using a stylus or a mouse to sort of click, you can also turn on underneath the timeline menu that's called selection follows playhead. And what that's going to do is going to automatically select whatever the highest most auto select track thing that's enabled over here. So this would be a way to select things without touching a single mouse, like, but sometimes it's just you use both hands, it's okay to use both. So you can see how I can move clips around by just command J takes it backwards. Let's say I want to move this one down to the right, pretty cool trick. Anyways, I have so much more stuff to talk about this keyboard. Let's get into it. Full disclosure, editor's keys, they sent this to me for free. But it's not an ad. They didn't pay me. This is just my thoughts that they wanted as a fan of editing input devices. Because in the past few years, I've used the key chron C two mechanical keyboard, the Apple magic keyboard with touch ID and the DaVinci resolve speed editor. Oh, and also I use those keyboard skins from editors keys, and they sit on top my MacBook Pro and Apple keyboard. So it protects it from prums and drink spills. We know we're not supposed to eat it or dust, but we do anyways features. Well, it's a full size keyboard, which in my mind is a requirement for serious video editing. And that's because it has a number pad on the right side. Number pad's great because you can precisely enter time code values like you would with any sort of accounting software by just ending plus and minus and the time code value. So you can move the play head, you can move clips, you can move pretty much anything you need to with it on the edit page. Now on the color page, it's really handy, because it shows you what the colors are for the printer lights. Now they're enabled on the color page by going under the color menu to printer light hockey's make sure that is checked. If it's checked, you can see it does have all your shortcuts available here. And this does work on any keyboard that has a number pad. It's not specific to this editor's keyboard on this particular image right here. If I wanted to put extra blue into it, the nine and six keys are controlling the blue. So if I wanted to put more blue into it, I get tap the nine key, and you can see I'm putting more blue into it. And it's controlling this value down here, the offset, which is a great way to sort of set stuff up without really changing the tonality of the of the image overall. So if that was too much, I can back off it. And if I want to take it off a little bit less than it is, just hold command with six. And those are smaller increments, you see their quarter amounts down here. I'm holding command, maybe I want to take put more blue into it and maybe has too much magenta, well magenta is the opposite of green. So I will push green into it with the eight key. And you can just quickly adjust and balance shots. Now one thing that's hard to tell from just looking at a picture on a website is, how does it feel like is it feel cheap? And I would say no, it's definitely feels solid. It's a lot like an Apple keyboard, but maybe a little bit heavier. Maybe there's a bigger battery in it, not quite sure why, but it feels like it's going to last a long time. One of the selling features of this keyboard is that it has a backlight. So the way the backlight works is you tap the button right next to the control, that turns it on, push it another time it gets a little brighter. Again, one more time brighter. So you have three brightness levels, push it again, turn it off during the daytime, or wait, you want to save battery. Supposedly I didn't count them. There's 150 shortcut hotkeys on here, and they're grouped by color. Something that was unique to me that I found useful on it is there's a magnifying glass that's right above the backspace key, and that's a search button. So instead of entering spotlight by hitting command space on a Mac, I don't know what it is on Windows, you could just hit that one button one time and get you to search your computer for anything you need to find. And the rest of the function keys at top are really nice as well. I particularly use the F4, F5, 6 buttons with the Apple podcast app so I can pause a podcast anytime a new call comes in. If you like a clean desk, there's no wires needed once you have the thing charged, obviously. It works over Bluetooth, and it charges over the USB-C port that's on the back right here. I find this nice because my Apple keyboard still requires me to use a lightning connector for that one specific device. This one uses the same thing that a lot of the other stuff on my desk will use. Another cool selling feature of the keyboard, it's multi-device. I think that's a lot like there's another one out there by Logitech called the MX Keys, and I have the MX Master Mouse which has three Bluetooth saves. What that means is I have a MacBook Pro set up next to me, and I can quickly switch to that easily. I can even copy and paste to it just by pushing the one, two, or three buttons that are right up there. So I have this working with a Mac Studio, a MacBook Pro, and an old 6-gen iPad, and it switches really quickly between the two so I don't have to have extra keyboards laying around. Even though honestly I love having extra keyboards around. Not a feature, but just know it works as a regular keyboard as well for typing. It has little nubs on the F key and the J key so you can find your way without looking down at it. Obviously this is the Mac version, but there is also a Windows version. It's just the Alt option and the Command Windows keys. They're just flopped. And the price, well, it's not the cheapest keyboard in the world, but it is a lot less than a speed editor or the DaVinci Resolve full-size keyboard. And it's usually less than the Apple Magic keyboard with Touch ID. Now the prices, they're always changing, so I would check the affiliate links in the description for the current price. One of the things I end up doing with a keyboard on any new Mac I sit down is make sure function keys work as function keys. Now in the current version of Mac OS, you go down to your system settings and then down here towards the bottom, choose keyboard, and then under keyboard choose keyboard shortcuts, down to function keys, and make sure you turn on this switch here that says use F1, F2 as standard function keys. Then all your keyboard shortcuts should be working fine. The other thing to pay attention to on this specific keyboard is there is a FN button and there's an FN lock. So if you want to lock your function keys so that they're not used, you can easily do that with hitting FN and the FN lock button, which is the search button. Typically I don't lock those. I want them to use those function keys. Just know that if you're having trouble with anything of your typical F9, F10, those are your insert and overwrite buttons, something is going on with those so you might want to check to unlock it. Opportunities to explore unmet potential. Down at the lower bottom left here, there is a function button. That means there's four buttons here. I typically always work on Macs and a typical Mac keyboard, here's the Apple one, has three buttons here. Not only is it three buttons, they're very different in specific sizes down there versus this one which has four. I'm sure this is because there's a Windows version and a Mac version, but what I have found is if I switch between these keyboards, one day I'm working on the Apple one, the next day I'm working on the editor's keys, I will accidentally hit control or option when I'm hitting the function button. It gets in the way, I think this is probably easily overcomable if you don't switch around between different keyboards like I do, but just know it's going to take some extra time. If you're used to only having three buttons down there, your control, option, and command buttons, because that extra four function button had to fit in there and it makes the other button smaller and you're never going to use that function button for all your modifiers when you're editing. Longer battery life with the backlight turned on. Let me explain. So on the website they claim three months on a single charge which is incredible. That means you plug it in once every three months or maybe two months, but that's what the backlight turned off. So as soon as you turn that backlight on, I'll tell you one day I turned it on to full blast and by the end of the day it was warning me in my Bluetooth settings, hey you should go charge your keyboard. So maybe at the lower power setting you might get more than a day, but the light definitely takes power which makes sense. So if you're going to use the backlight you might need to plug it in more often than you realize and if they could figure out a way to optimize the power even more in a future version or something, that would be great. If you're big into Fusion like I am or Fairlight for audio, there's not really a whole lot of shortcuts that are specific to those pages, just makes sense, but I don't know maybe in the future if those got more popularity there could be a specific Fusion keyboard or Fairlight keyboard. And the last little opportunity I would say is the texture of the keyboard and this might change as I use it more in the oils from my fingers get on here, but I feel like it's a little bit more slippery than other keyboards. Like when I when I have my fingers on here they're not quite as grounded as they are on some of the other keyboards or if I was even just to use the silicone covers that Editors Keys makes as well. Let's try to wrap this up and compare it with some of the devices I already have like the Keychron C2. I love that because it has a great price, it sounds great, it feels great, but then again I get complaints on long zoom calls because I'm clickety-clacketing too much and it's just picks up on the microphone. I love the Apple Magic keyboard with Touch ID because it helps me not need to enter my password as often when I'm doing a lot of admin tasks because it you know just takes my fingerprint right. It also the downside is it has that expensive Apple tax that we all hate to pay. I still love the DaVinci Resolve speed editor obviously it's got the cool search style which replaces your JKL navigation. It comes with a free version of DaVinci Resolve Studio which basically pays for itself, but you still really need a keyboard next to it for other navigation and computer tasks. And for me personally I use Jump Desktop which is a remote software to remote into other computers and because it's a specialty Bluetooth device it doesn't work across to those computers where a normal keyboard does. And I love the new Editors Keys backlit wireless Resolve keyboard because I can hop between devices easily and have a bit more light on my desk when I'm editing in a dark room. So what keyboard do I use all the time? Well that's just like asking me what kids my favorite. They're just different. It just depends on the day. Please let me know down in the comment section which keyboard you're using that maybe I overlooked.
