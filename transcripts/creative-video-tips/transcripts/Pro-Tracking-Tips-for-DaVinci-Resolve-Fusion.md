Point tracking is great in DaVinci Resolve Fusion because it's completely controllable. So let's learn how to track even when patterns go completely off the screen. It goes off screen in the same direction or behind an object. It had information on that side of the pole, this side of the pole, and it figured out the motion path using a basic text call out. And then as a big bonus at the end, discovered how you can actually separate your tracked fusion graphics from your background video layer so you can color correct your background video footage later on and never worry about making a compound clip. If you'd like to follow along exactly, pause the video right now, go to creativevideotips.com slash cutting club to download the source footage and project files and become a member for just $3. Okay, so the footage today as I bring this in, you can see it's a guy walking across the street in New York. We're going to track his head, but you can see his log footage. It's like flat. There's not a lot of contrast. So a good superpower that Resolve has is color management to bring this back down in the lower right. There's a little gear, click that, go down to the third tap color management. We're going to turn on the color science to be set a wire GB, which is based on what you see is what you get. We're going to give it a little bit more information by using DaVinci wire GB color manage and HDR. Click save and nothing happened Chadwick. Why not? Well, this is a progress clip. There's no metadata associated with it. Inheritably like it would be if it was a raw clip. But we can tell it what the color space it was shot with. And this was a black magic pocket cinema camera 4K. So I'm going to right click on the clip, go down to input color space. This is a new thing that will have appeared with having color management turned on. Go down to black magic design and we're choosing black magic design film gen five. And now you can see everything looks more like normal like you would have seen in real life and it will track better because there's contrast there. Now to get into fusion, just click the fusion page button that's right down here in the center with the playhead parked over the clip you want to open. Got fusion open. Now I like to work with a top down mid flow is what they call it in here because I only want to see one viewer at a time. It actually makes processing easier. It gives a better screen real estate. So to get to there, I'm going to workspace, layout presets, fusion presets and mid flow. Okay, this is going to give us sort of a top down workspace and I just want to use one of my two viewers. So I click this to make this the primary one. It's the number two viewer and over in here in the flow area where your script is being written, I can hold down. I'm using a Wacom, Wacom pen. I can hold down on here and zoom in and out. But if you have a mouse, just hold command or control as that backup goes to zoom in and out and that goes the same over here in the viewer. Whenever your cursor is pointed, when you zoom in, it goes right to that point. That's great thing about fusion that you don't get in the edit page when you're zooming around or panning around. Let me get to where my media out and my media in are over here and I'll situate these in a top down view. When you're working in a color managed workflow, you're actually working by default and linear. So if I turn this fusion view lot off up here, you can see that's what the track is actually working with. This is the proper way to do compositing. Mathematically, this is how you should be doing things. So it gets rid of that extra set up of having to set up a linear workflow. That's a topic for another tutorial. But let's get to tracking by selecting the media in and I'm going to type in shift space that brings up a tool list. This is how you add all your effects here in fusion. I'm going to type in tra that gets us our point tracker and we can see we have some green stuff over here that has appeared. This is our pattern box. That's basically the area it's looking for. And then the search area box is basically if it loses it, it has trouble it's going to look in that area around it. Before we actually do anything else, I want to point out over here, we're looking at the media in. Whenever you track, you want to be looking through the tracker to see if it's successful or not. So to look through it, I'm going to click and drag and bring this on over here. Now you can see that white dot is on our two viewer. That means it's loaded over here. So we're going to see the changes update as we do our tracking. Let's get to sort of a middle frame. I don't know, right around here. And I want to track his little, his AirPods or earphones that are in there. And the way you move the trackers in fusion, it's the upper left. So this is to move the box around for where the tracker is looking, the upper left. So grab that upper left corner and we're dragging and moving. We got a little zoomed in view. I'm going to park it right on that area. And I want to shrink this down so it's a lot smaller. Just dragging the edges makes this little pattern box smaller. And the search area can be, maybe you still leave it a little wide because he's walking left to right, but it could be shrunk down a little bit as well. So this doesn't jump to another area that it thinks is his white spot in front of his ear. The other thing I'll say right off the start here is if you change your adaptive mode in the inspector over here on the right, right now it's set to none, which basically says every single frame is going to be looking at what the shape and the lighting is right here. Instead, there's a mode in here called best match. Best match doesn't take that much longer. And what it does is it computes that original pattern area with frames that are around it to see if it should update what it's actually looking for over time. So I'm choosing best match. And why don't we go ahead and start doing a track? Over here we've got a track to end from where the current playhead is. Let's click that. And you can see I'm going to zoom out. We got there, but he going off screen. And so we have stuff that is not tracked as it goes off screen. We'll deal with that in just a minute. So hang with me. Let's go back to our first tracked frame. You can see our keyframes down here at the bottom. We don't have keyframes earlier on. So to get our, our, to track as he goes back towards the train station, we'll do this button right here tracks backwards. And you can see it follows along. Oh, he hit a pole. We lost something. We have danger at Will Robinson. Anyway, so as he gets to there, we can deal with this in several different ways. The first one I want to show you is how you actually manually move a point that's been tracked incorrectly. So to move left and right keyframes, it's the bracket keys on the keyboard. Left takes you backwards. And you can see it all HG double hockey stick skills loose right here. So as I move here, it totally lost it as it goes behind the pole as expected because it doesn't know what it's looking for. But if you wanted to manually move it, you could move the point that the frame to that, what is this frame 38 where it goes off. And you can take this point and move this over to where you think it should be. So that's how you would manually move it. However, there's sort of a better way that you can let the computer do all this. And by the way, if you ever manually moving stuff, be careful because this operates at a sub pixel level. The computer is smarter than us most of the time. So when you can let the computer do the work, let it do the work. And the other thing I was going to point out, when I first started working in this, I would start moving this pattern box, which is the upper left. That's how you tell the computer where to work. The center area here is where you do your manual work at. Okay. So, and this is adjusted after we already have tracking points. The next concept I want to talk about is last best frame. And so to get us across this poll, we're going to let the computer do the work, but we want to find the last best good tracking data frame. And the last good one is probably right here. This is frame 39. And so I'm going to delete all the bad tracking data towards the beginning. And to do that, you can open up the spline editor up here and turn this on down here. And you can see all of the tracking data marks that have been made to delete just the section we want. You could hit this if you don't see everything, this little, this is like a zoom to fit sort of deal. And then we also have the magnifying glass do this. And you can sort of marquee select to get a view that fits in your window, right? And we're going to select all the bad tracking data, which is from here onto the left. You can see those are selected, hit the delete key, and those are gone. So to track around a poll or any other occlusion, go to the other side of the poll where you can see the object you want to track again. So now I'm over here on frame 36. I'm going to move my tracking box, not the point, not the center one, but this upper left box back to where I wanted to be searching for to be doing the tracking. And from here on, you can see we have no tracking in between there. That's fine. We're going to hit track backwards. And it looks like it did pick it up. I lost zoom a little bit. But until he goes out of frame, I'm going to go back, back, back, back, you can see we now have tracking data that goes behind the poll. And down here, you can see there's nothing there except for a line. Well, the computer has figured out it had information on that side of the poll, this side of the poll, and it figured out the motion path they should have. So that's how you get around sort of occlusions and that sort of thing. But what about the beginning and ends of these? We got, it goes haywire at the, you know, when it goes off frame. Well, the way we're going to fix that is with a tool called gradient extrapolation. I know it's a big word for me too. Let's get to the beginning frame and we're going to go to the last best frame. Again, a key thing to think about and know about when you're doing tracking. Our last good frame looks like it's this one, 18. So I'm going back down here to the spline editor. I'm going to delete all the bad tracking information and we'll let him track as I scroll around here and we get to the end where it is no good. Right here, we're on frame 110, it looks like. And this is our last good frame as he goes off screen this way. I'm going to hit my zoom over here and then our little zoom tool to sort of see those key frames and we're going to blow away all the key frames at the end that are bad and we still want this to continue off screen because I'm going to put text on this and I want the text to follow off screen. So gradient extrapolation is how you do that and the way you access it is with the spline editor open, I'm going to right click control and we got right here. Gradient extrapolation, click that and you can see it's made a path online that basically follows the, it goes off screen in the same direction on both the beginning and end of the tracking data. So that gets you off screen. So if you have a text call out or whatever you're doing that involves tracking, I'm going to hit command F or control F to go full screen. It will continue that motion path all the way off screen. See how that works? It's really, really handy. So since our track is good, we can actually lock this. If you select the tracker list, click this twice and it goes to like a circle. And now I can't accidentally bump it at all. Okay. Now we have a solid XY translation point tracker path and we want to merge some texts on top of it to use as a call out. So up here, we have the merge node. If you're not used to fusion yet, you're going to be using merge all the time. And we're going to take our background input, which is going to be the footage. That's going to go into the yellow input, the background input of merge. Okay. And then the foreground is going to be some text. We don't have text down here yet. Let's grab our text tool. That's this right here. It's the text plus from the edit page. And if you want to see what you're typing, when you're typing it, click and drag to load that in the viewer. We'll type New York. And because New York is a little classy, we'll change the font to Dydot. Looks a little nicer. And to get this text on top of the footage, you take the gray output over here into the green foreground input of the merge. And once you do that, they've been merged together. The way I like to connect things, because this could end up being have a whole lot of graphics, not just text. And you want this to track to our tracker position, the XY position we had. We can do that in the merge. If you go to the inspector under the center parameter, this has an XY, you know what we're going to do? We're going to right click on center. I know it's weird. Like there's no other way to know that you do this other than you right click on the word center text. We're going to connect this to tracker one, tracker one offset position. So I'm slowing down here. Tracker one, tracker one offset position. And just like that, you'll see the tracker position is basically the center of that text is stuck to the center of the track that we did. Now it's actually, it's the center of the merge is what's there. So you could throw in a bunch of stuff in there and the center point of the merge is there. But what if I want it up higher? Well, the reason I did it as offset position is because we can actually go back to the tracker and adjust the offset position with some onscreen controls that are really handy. But to be able to do that, we actually need to unlock the tracker over here so that we can do some modifications. And then in the upper left, you'll see this little blue button when you click on it, it turns blue. Now we can go in and zoom in and pull out a red line. See that red line? So we can adjust the offset position of whatever we're connected to. That yellow, that red line, it's going to maintain that offset throughout the whole animation of the path. See how that works? Pretty snazzy. Anything that moves on a tracker probably should have motion blur because if you wanted to look cinematic, things have motion blur in real life, that's how our eyes even perceive things. So to turn motion blur on, you think of what's doing the moving. The thing that's doing the moving is the merge tool in this instance. It's moving the text. And so anything that moves things has a motion blur switch in Fusion. So under settings is typically where it is. And then we've got motion blur. Turn that on, crank up the quality and watch the computer struggle because it's rendering a little harder. But that might be too much blur. So if you wanted to still have that sort of legible, you could go to the shutter angle, which normally you're going to have at 180. You could turn this down. It's a stylistic choice. Turn that down to 90 and it makes it a little bit sharper. If you go back to the edit page, we don't have the graphic. Why not? Well, it's because our media out is still piped into our tracker note over here. You can break this apart. And what we actually want to do is disconnect this and connect our composition that we did with the text, the output of there into media out. Now that we have that connected, we have the composition is fully being rendered back out to the edit page. You might want to turn on if you have trouble with playback, go to playback, render cache. I like to usually set this at user because I'm a control freak and user lets me control things. Once that's set to user, you need to also select the clip and go to render cache color output. And that basically renders everything downstream of the color page, which fusions also downstream the color page. So you get this blue bar that turns to red once it's done rendering. And you should get, you know, solid smooth playback. You could be done and check out right now, but I want to show you something. If you go to the color page at this point and let's make a, you can see we've got our animation in there. Let's close this so you can see a little larger. Let's say we want to change our gain. What we've just done is as soon as you change the gain on this clip, you've actually changed the color of the actual title too. And maybe you don't want to do that. So the next trick I'm going to show you is how you can use channel boolean set to clear to separate things out and work with them independently with a comp in the edit page. Let's just do this reset node grade. We're back to normal. Let's go to the edit page and we're going to make a duplicate of this comp right here by selecting it, holding option shift drag up that restrains it so it doesn't move left and right at all. And the top one's going to be our graphic. The bottom one's going to be our color correct. So I want to remove the graphic from the bottom one so I can see the bottom one. I'm going to disable with D on the keyboard. So now I'm looking at the one underneath and to reset the fusion comp, I'll right click on it, say reset fusion composition. Okay. Do I want to do that? Yes, I really do. Now you'll see in the lower right, it still has that icon maybe in future versions, they fix this. It's still cached even that frame. Go to the color page back to the edit page. You'll see it's actually gone. So the bottom layer has the graphic removed from it. I can come over here and color correct this however I want to. Maybe I'll make it purple this time. Who knows? Back to the edit page. I'll turn that top layer back on and we can't see through to the color correction we did. Well, here's where channel booleans comes in because we have this selected and it's on top. We can go to the fusion button, the fusion page button right there. And we're going to load a channel booleans tool. It's my favorite tool in fusion. Hit shift space. BOL is the shortcut to get to it. I'm going to click enter to accept it. And now what I want to do is I want to interrupt the background footage from hitting this merge over here. And so to insert this in between this part of the signal flow, you hold down shift while you drag this and it turns yellow to blue. And then the channel booleans is in there. It hasn't done anything quite yet though. What we need to do is under channel booleans operation over here. It's set to copy is sort of the default. We're going to change this to make it clear. We're going to use clear. So we're basically making the background clear, but you're still passing through all the tracking data that should still be in the flow here. As well as this is an important thing. You're maintaining the source resolution of the file. So I personally normally work at 1080p. But the source footage is larger. If I were to do a different method, which involves changing this to media source beam background, it messes up all the tracking data because it's looking at the timeline resolution. So channel booleans set to clear is what you want to use. Go to the edit page and check this out. We actually have a white title on top of the colored footage. And at any time I can come back over here to the color page, do a different color correct on this. Let me hit Z to zoom to fit. Okay. Z to zoom to fit. And I could change my offset to anything else. Or I could change, you know, let's make that yellow. And that title has stayed where it is. If you don't want to see that while you're color grading, hit this unmixed button right here. And that sort of turns off all your composites. But that's the trick. Channel boolean set to clear and you're in the clear. I just want you to know you are very appreciated. And because there's so much more to learn, I'll see you in the next video.
