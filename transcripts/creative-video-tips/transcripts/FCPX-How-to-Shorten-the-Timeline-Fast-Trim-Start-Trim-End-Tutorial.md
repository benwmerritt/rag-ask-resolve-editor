What if I told you there's a way to go from using three button clicks or pushes down to just one to trim up a video? Today I want to show you how trim start and trim end will drastically speed up your editing in Final Cut Pro X. Hey, if you're new here, my name is Chadwick. Thanks so much for clicking on this link.

Alright, now let's jump into the machine and I'll teach you all about trim start, trim end, and how that's going to save you a ton of time. Let's go. So here we are over in Final Cut. I've got a timeline of a bunch of clips from a trip to Hawaii that I had taken. And it's 44 minutes long, 45 minutes long. That's way too long. So we're going to trim it down and we're going to use, up here we're going to be using the commands under the trim, trim start and trim end. And now what I see most editors do is they will actually, they don't know about that or they forget about it. Rather than using those commands, they'll use what ends up taking three or four times as long. They'll go to remove sections of this timeline to make it shorter. They'll go over here and they'll grab the blade tool for B for blade. And let's say I don't want the beginning of this clip, right? It's just like we're just setting up the shot here with these tattoos. They'll click, I don't want that part. So that's one click. Then they'll switch to their selection tool and then they'll select that about that's the second click. And then they will hit delete. Now if you're deleting and it's not Final Cut Pro, it's going to do that sort of thing, right? Where it's leaving a space. So that's a third click. And then you click this and then that's a fourth click just to remove that little section there. If you're to do the other thing on the other side of a clip, it's kind of the same deal, right? So let's say this is the end of my shot. I'm going to grab the blade tool B for blade. I'm going to blade it. I'm going to select it with my select tool. That's a second click. And then, you know, if you use the normal delete button in Final Cut Pro, because of the magnetic timeline, you can click delete and it just removes it. That's a lot of clicks, right? There's a much faster way to do that. And that's what trim start, trim end is all about. If you're coming from a W premiere, they call it ripple trim previous edit, ripple trim next edit, and use the Q and W keys. It's basically doing the exact same thing. DaVinci Resolve actually takes a lot of the same sort of commands from Final Cut Pro X. They call it trim start, trim end. But the one I like the best actually comes from Avid, who's the one that came up with it. They call it top and tail. So if you ever hear your top and tail, that's what we're talking about. Here's how top and tail works. So as I showed you before, it's up here in the trim menu. So if you ever forget the commands, it's going to be option, left and right bracket. Okay, so what I like to do, I'm using a wake on pen in my right hand. And then my left hand, I will ride that over on the right side of the keyboard. So I've got option with my thumb, and then I'll use usually my middle finger for the bracket keys. So the way this is going to work is we'll come back down here to the timeline. And I've got the skimmer turned on. And you know, let's say, hey, I like maybe parts of one of these shots, right? I don't want the very beginning of this as I'm going under the bridge for whatever reason. I'm just going to use the scrubber. So I'm just kind of hovering over and I'm going to do option, left bracket. Okay, so that just sort of ripples the whole thing out. And if you haven't seen, there is a video that I did all about the different four different types of trimming. And when you're doing video editing, I'll link that up above. So what trim start trim and are doing is ripple trims basically, I want to take out everything. I'm kind of circling here. I want to take out everything to the left of this edit point, right? Because generally that's you're going to hit record, then you're going to get your stuff framed up. And then you get the good stuff and then you have to go hit record again or the actions already happening. You don't want the tail end of that clip. So I like this part where he pushes down, right? So I want to say the start, the start of the clip should be there. So I'm going to use option, left bracket and that trimmed up the left side of the clip. And then there's a bunch on the right side. I'm not going to want. So he lifts it away and then that's kind of the end of the shot. So from this point on, where my skimmers at, I'm going to option right bracket. And that just took care of a ton of excess on that clip. So what you would do then is you can just go clip to clip to clip and really quickly, it's a one command thing, right? So maybe I want him just grabbing this postcard right or a little piece of art that he made. It's option left bracket, pulls it up, takes a look at it, and then we do an option right bracket. And we've just made things a lot shorter and that just took one click. Sweet, right? One more thing I just thought of that you're going to be wondering about is like, well, what if I want multiple segments of the same clip, right? You would just go through and say, oh, here's the middle of between takes command B. Here's the middle of those clips command B, command B, command B, right? Now what you've essentially done is you've broken up that longer take or that longer clip into these five or six or however many takes you do within that long clip. So now that you've got all those, it's the same thing you go to the beginning. It's like, oh, the clip hasn't started or the take hasn't started yet. Option left bracket. Here's the end of the take option right bracket, option left bracket, option right bracket, option left bracket, option right bracket, and so on and so on. You get the idea, right? I don't need to labor this at all, but those quick commands are going to save you so much time and I'm excited for you to learn them. Next thing I want to show you real quick about using trim start trim end is that you can use that with the position tool. Now, if you're not familiar with position tool that is over here, so it looks kind of like the select tool, but it's the position tool. It's like a different sort of error looking thing. And what the position tool does is it leaves gaps. So if you ever wonder why the magnetic timeline is not working, it's probably because you have the position tool selected. So let's say we do the exact same thing now with the position tool. I want to take the left side off of this clip. I'm going to do an option left bracket. And rather than it closing up, it's going to leave a hole there. This is not something I would use for, you know, making a timeline a lot shorter. But if you need to insert some sort of a gap or space or some sort of a beat for music or a title, this is how you do it. Then for this not to happen, if you notice it's happening, you just go right back over here, choose the select tool and you can trim that up and remove it. One thing I'll say about like connected clips and that sort of thing. So like here's a cut of music. It works with that too. It works with connected clips. It works in compound clips. The way you want to select something like this easily, because normally if you just hover here and you don't have anything selected, it's going to choose the primary storyline. Right. So the way you would select it is you just have to hover your mouse cursor over what you want selected and then hit C. So that's in a little shortcut today. C for select clip. And once that is selected, it knows because you have something selected that it's going to take a precedent over whatever the primary storyline is. So now let's say I want to cut this thing shorter. I would do option right bracket and it went exactly to where my skimmer was option left bracket cuts that piece of music to the left side. So pretty sweet. Right. I mean, you've gone from before you were probably doing, you know, blade click, click, click to now you are just doing a simple click. Much, much quicker way of doing things. I said that was the last thing, right? I sort of lied. One more thing I just wanted to bring up is the talking about the skimmer, which is this red play head and then you've got the white play head. Right. So the way Final Cut works is the skimmer always has precedent if it's turned on over the play head for any of these commands. So that's why if I want to trim this at this point right here and do an option right bracket, it's going to trim at that point where my skimmer was not where the white play head is. Okay. So if you want to be more precise about something, because you can see right now I'm moving my pen around, it's kind of loose. It's an approximation, right? If you turn your skimmer off, which is over here, you can also push S is the shortcut, right? So S turns things on and off. Now that it's off, you can scrub to exactly that frame or even use your left and right arrows on the keyboard. So here I am. And then now that the skimmers turn off, it's going to do the here's going to be a trim and option right bracket. And it's going to do that trim and where the play head is. So that kind of goes across the board for a whole lot of things in Final Cut Pro. But just know that the hierarchy goes, your skimmers turned on, which is S or this little button over here. It's always going to want to do whatever function you're doing, whether it's trim start, trim end, it could be a ton of different things. Extend at it, which we'll get into in another video. It's going to do that based off of skimmer first, then the play head. And then going further, if you have a clip selected. So like we looked at the connected clip that was selected. Now not only are you a trimming master, but you've also saved yourself 66% of your time going from three clicks down to one.
