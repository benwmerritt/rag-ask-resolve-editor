Hi, today I'd like to take you on a step by step for how you can do a commercial quality tattoo removal using the brand new Vector Warp Tool that's in DaVinci Resolve 20 and Fusion 20. There is no tracking required with this, so it's actually not that difficult to learn how to do. I'm going to teach you how you can actually get best performance using a crop node sandwich, which is great when you have those newer higher res-censored cameras. You also learn how you can lock off and stabilize the tattoo so that that way the cleanup can take on all the different lighting changes that happen over time to blend in perfectly. Oh, also, I'm going to cover a simple edge extension trick so that you can essentially paint out the tattoo without even needing to open or touch the paint node. As usual, I put the footage up on Cutting Club for those that want to follow along with my free YouTube tutorials. Now let's do this. DaVinci Resolve 20 Beta gets all the love, so today I'm going to open up Fusion Studio 20, because why not? You get a little bit more RAM, a little more power, so if you have Resolve Studio, you also have a license to download and install Fusion Studio 20. I want to show you under the Preferences, the Global and Defaults, I'm starting my comps at frame 1001. If you want to do the same, I suggest you change that here, create a new composition, and it'll start that way. Fusion Studio doesn't use media ends. It uses loaders, but essentially what you can do, I'm going to drag any one of my frame sequence into here, and it creates a loader node, which is like a media end. The only difference here is to note that the duration is not automatically set up in my timeline down here, based off of the footage, like it is if you go from the Edit page to the Fusion page. So what I do is I hold down Shift, and then I click and drag down here to the Timeline ruler, and that will set up my duration, so my comp is all set, which is basically like the project file for the single shot to get working. Now the other thing I want to point out is this is ASUS CG footage, so it's linear, which means it's probably looking dark over here. So one thing you may want to do is turn on your view lot so it looks more normal to your eye. So if you click this button over here, actually if I head that down, it opens up my gain and gamma, but if I go down here to ASUS Transform, that's the one I'm using in the Edit, just choose the input set to ASUS CG, and then your outputs can be whatever your computer monitor is, and then you can see everything like normal. In fact, you probably don't want to have gamut compression showing for ASUS 2.0. That was a bad on my part. Now the next thing is to take a look at the resolution. So the resolution is 2K 2048 by 1080, and the tattoo that we're going to be removing is on this guy's neck, and the amount of pixels we need to work with is not actually all that big, and so there's a sort of a hacky way of doing this that allows you to make the computer run much faster by cropping it just to the area you're working on and then merging that back over the top. So we're going to do that with a crop tool, and I'll show you how that works. So after the loader node, I'm going to hit Shift Space, type in crop, CROP, load that into the viewer, and something I was unaware of for a long time is in the upper left, now that the crop node is selected, I have this on-screen control that I can select. It turns white, and then I can basically draw a nice little box around the area I want to crop to. Command F will fit that to my viewer, and the idea is I've just cut the resolution down quite a bit. I'm down to 331 by 301. Now I do want to make sure this stays centered enough here, so it looks like it's more to the right, so I can come over here to the inspector on it and just change my offset. So I'm making sure to keep the tattoo visible the whole time because I'm going to be locking and stabilizing this section off, and then it gets merged back over the top. Now how do I get it back over the top so that it gets placed in the right spot? That's all I'll show you next. I'm going to take this crop tool, Command C, Command V, I've got a direct copy of it, load that into my viewer, and the X and Y size is basically what is the resolution of the footage. Well, if I load the footage over here, it's 2048 by 1080. So second crop tool, X size will be that. So 2048, Y size is 1080, and then the offsets are going to be just negative by, so I'm hitting tab to go between those, I'm just putting a negative in front of them, and you'll see this is placed that back in the exact same pixel where it came from, and then it just has to be merged back over the top. So if I come over here, make a little shortcut to merge, just take what you want on top, stick it on top of the original footage, and so it's placed it back where it needs to go. And so the idea is, I'll move these down here, and we'll have this area over here to do all of our cleanup and paint work. Vector warp. The way vector warp works is it needs motion vectors, and this footage doesn't have motion vectors to start with, so we have to create them. And the tool in Fusion, and Resolve Fusion as well, to do that is called Optical Flow. So show space, Optical Flow, get that right down there, and our flow, no pun intended, and you'll notice at the output of this node here, if you come over here, we now have vectors, which are these crazy red, green, yellow looking things, and basically it's tracking pixels from one frame to the next, and so this is how we're going to be doing cleanup instead of a typical match move from a tracker tool. So it's really nice, anytime you have like a soft, organic, flowy sort of fabric or skin that has a lot of movement that can't just be captured in perspective, this can be a nice way to do it. So I'm going to come over here, change this back to color, so we can see what we're working with, and next after the Optical Flow node, because we have basically the output at this has motion vectors, we can add the new node, and that is just base vector warp. Vector warp, as soon as you drop it down, it places a reference frame based on the frame that was existing, which is generally the frame you're either painting to, match move, that's your reference frame. So I need to find a more clear reference frame to do, I'm not going to do paint work, I'm going to do edge extension technique. Maybe you can use the bracket keys to move back and forth. Maybe this one, 1080 one looks like a good one for me to set as my reference frame. So on 1080 one, I come over here to the tool, I say set frame, and so we have a reference frame here, but the operation now is set to generate warp and map. We will use this mode, but that's to do the match moving later on. To start, what I need to do is change this to unwarp mode. Unwarp is like the stabilize, so basically with it set to unwarp, we're stabilizing around this frame, 1080 one, and you'll see it's basically locked off that tattoo right there. So next up is to remove that tattoo. You could use the paint tools, but an often overlooked tool that you could use here to make sure you're pulling all those colors together is the clean plate tool and doing it in edge extend. So let's take a look at how that works. So I'm going to park it on the frame that I chose as my reference. I'm going to first create a brightness contrast BC afterwards, and this is just a handy way to apply a mask to something. So rather than having lots of different media ends or lots of different loaders that you're masking off, typically I like to use brightness and contrast or matte control to how I want to have a copy of the footage. Now that we're here on this frame, I'm going to zoom in, just middle mouse to zoom, grab a polygon tool, and we will trace out the area that we want to remove. I'm essentially going to cut a hole, like a stencil, around this flower tattoo. Because what this will let me do is take where that line is, where this hard mask is, and take those edge pixels. Now I'm going to connect this to the brightness and contrast node, and we'll take a look at that. And it hasn't done anything yet because I haven't applied this mask. So a quick easy way to apply a mask to a brightness and contrast is just turn on the alpha on it, and then turn the gain down because the gain is basically doing multiplication. And you can see we've cut out a hole there. So now with that hole cut out, we can use this to take the color of this and move it towards the center with clean plate. So this is in lieu of not using paint. It's kind of a neat way to take the color and move it on in. So after brightness and contrast, shift space, clean plate tool. With the clean plate tool, it has two inputs. There's a normal background input, and then if you see we also have a garbage mat. So I'm basically doing two connection points into this. It doesn't look right at first, but if I come over to the mask tab of it, garbage mat invert it, and then I come back to the plate side, I can either choose the fill button or you can say grow edges, and you can see how it basically takes those edges and moves them inward. I might choose fill, but just note there's hard lines in here. So we do need to clean this up a little bit with like a blur afterwards. Simple enough to do with clean plate selected, show space blur. Take a look at the result of the blur. A default is just one, so I'll just turn that up a little bit. Looks nice and smooth. And we need to mask that out. We don't want blur everywhere, we just want it in our patch section, right? So what I'll do to mask it out, lots of ways to mask it out. I like to use mask paint whenever possible because it's fast and it's nice and it's easy. Usually mask paint is like a paint tool, but it only works on an alpha channel. And the way this can work is you just plug this directly into the blur to just restrict it to the area I'm going to paint. I'm going to select the mask paint tool, up here I'm going to choose stroke mode, which is the third one over so that it applies on all frames using command or control to increase the size of my brush. And I'm just going to be painting in the section that I want to have that blur affected. You can see the results of that over here. If I just want to look at the mask paint. So now we're getting somewhere, right? It's looking pretty good. The next piece of it is I want to actually cut this patch out so that I can control it completely separately in case I needed to add vector motion blur or anything later on. And the way I'll do that, just like before I used a brightness and contrast. This one had alpha turned on and gain down to zero. I'll show you another way you can use brightness and contrast to cut a patch out. So this one, I'll use BC, brightness, contrast. And this one, I'm going to use that same mask that I built over here, stick this into brightness and contrast. And on this one, on the settings tab, a lot of these have this multiply by mask button. And you can see we've got that all cut out. Now it's not moving yet. So the next step is we need to get this sucker to move. And the way we get it to move is another copy of vector warp. So vector warp right now is set to unwarp. We're going to basically do the match move version as what I would call a vector warp. So I'm going to command C, command V. And the yellow input always needs to be the optical flow. So actually, if I right click this here, you'll see the input. The input is the original one that has motion vectors from there. Okay, that's the original footage. And then the cleanup, the green foreground is going to be the texture input. So it's the green input. Right click over there. That'll be texture. You'll notice nothing happens because it didn't change the settings on the vector warp. Now we still have this set to reference frame 1,081. So it's important that those are the same. But the operation now needs to change to generate warp and map. This is like merge foreground over background and a point tracker. Or if you did like a steady and then invert steady with a planar tracker, same concept here if you're familiar with those. And so now we're basically warping and moving that cleanup that we had just done across all those frames and it blends really, really nicely. So to get this to merge back over the top of our original footage, instead of the coming out here, we'll take the output going back into our crop, which is going to place it back into position. Now one thing you'll notice here is this basically did like a pre-merge for us. I don't care for that so much because if I needed to add extra motion blur to it, I wouldn't be able to. So I will uncheck the merge warp over BG. And another setting this has that can be really handy from my testing so far is there's a smooth UV setting, which just basically smooths out the distortion over time so that you might not get some extra jaggy. So this could be turned up even higher than, I mean it goes up to five here, but you could crank that higher if you needed to to really smooth out. You can see how those pixels are warping to fit as is neck was turning and stuff. So let's take a look at the merge. Pretty, pretty good. Actually there's a spot here where I'm seeing a dark spot of this tattoo that I think was still existing so I might need to extend, I bet it was part of this cutout over here. It probably just needs to be extended out a little bit more. So I'll come over back over here to my mask paint. Actually I should be looking at the node as I'm doing it. So maybe just need to reveal a little bit more of my patch there. There we go. All of the tattoo is gone and if you needed to add vector motion blur you certainly could do that as well, but I'm going to call this one good. Take a look at the setup. I'm going to hit command F. I'm going to move this over to the side a little bit. Ah, move this over to the side a little bit. I'm going to see the before by going to my B buffer over here, load the original footage and then there's a split that you can come over here and see buffer split wipe or it's the slash key on the keyboard. And then if you hold option and command you can click to target where that split is. So you can quickly check to see did I get rid of everything that I needed to and make sure every frame looks good, that it's blended nicely and because we did it on a stabilized plate all the lighting changes from his head changes are coming with it. So how do you get this thing out now that it's all rendered and we're happy with it? All you need to do is add what's called a saver infusion studio. So after the merge I would shift space, saver and then you have your choice here to change it to under format. You can change it. So if you don't want EXR you can change. So you've got ProRes, QuickTime files, all that sort of stuff and then once you set all those where you want them you hit the render button over here and then you can go back to DaVinci Resolve and editing. So hey welcome if you're new here. I'm Chadwick. I'm a New York based DaVinci Resolve master trainer and finishing artist but I'm just so thankful for you and because there's so much more to learn I'll see you in the next video.
