Every video editing application has a way to stabilize that shaky handheld footage, but the results are not always great. And new Sony cameras like the ZV-E10, the ZV-1, the A7C, the A7S III, the FX3, FX6, FX9, RX02, they all record gyroscopic metadata into the files to help you fix it in post using their free software Swiss Army knife, Sony Catalyst Browse. The results are really incredible. So let me show you how to take advantage of this new technology before you plan on taking advantage of the new Sony Gyro metadata. Here are three key things to keep in mind before you film. Shoot wide. Sony Catalyst Browse will decrease your image resolution by punching into the image. So make sure your frame has a lot of room around the edge for this. The cool thing about doing this in post is that you can actually control how much of the image gets cropped in, which I'm going to demo in the next section of this video. If you can't manage to lose a single 4K pixel, then it's a good idea to pick up a gimbal instead. And this is my Ronin S right here that pretty much never gets used anymore. Increase your shutter speed. Toss out every rule you've been taught about 180 degree shutter speeds. Instead, we want no motion blur. Think saving Private Ryan. This is a side note, but the same thing actually holds true for green screen VFX shoots. The less motion blur you have, the better off you're going to be in post. Aim for about a 45 degree shutter angle. If you have enough light for it, I'd say at least one over 125th second shutter would be good, but even better as if you can go to like one over 200th. Be mindful of interior shoots that have flickering lights. This can't always be avoided. So this could be a deciding factor if you're going to plan to use the gyromated data when you're shooting inside. Always turn your lights up to 100% if they're on a dimmer and that's going to help a little bit. Now you want to disable all stabilization that's on the camera. The lens stabilization, I best turn it off. You don't need it. And now go and download install Catalyst Browse software. Make sure you don't get the Catalyst prepared. It requires a paid fee and it's not necessary. So I put a link down in the description to get Catalyst Browse if you don't already have it. Over here in Sony Catalyst Browse on my 2015 iMac, you can see I've copied my entire card's folder structure onto the hard drive. So if I double click into this folder right here and I go into Private, M4 Root, that's where Sony is storing all my video clips. And I just want to be stabilizing the one that I need because this does take some time, especially on an older computer. So if I double click this one right here, I want to be stabilizing this 780 one clip. All you need to do is find the section of the clip that you want to be stabilizing. Okay, so I've already done that here with these little marks. If you hit mark in right there and drag to the part where you are done with your shot, you can mark it out with that. That's going to save you a lot of time when you go to export because it's only going to do that little range. Now over on the left side, you'll see these little icons here, these little stabilization things. This lets you know this is a clip that can be stabilized. Well basically everything on this camera could be stabilized because I didn't shoot any 120fps footage. So basically the limitation to the Catalyst Browse as far as I understand right now is anything 60fps and under, you can stabilize. It just has to be on one of these newer cameras. So the way you stabilize it, super simple. You can either have it selected here and hit stabilize, which is this button right here, or you could right click on it and say stabilize clip, which we're going to do right now. So it analyzes it. It goes super fast because it's just taking that metadata, that gyro metadata, the XYZ, all that stuff, that information in it. On the left side, it shows us the before, the right side shows us the after by default, and we can click and play to see what it has decided on its own that it should be doing to stabilize it. And you can see it's taking out big giant shakes right off the bat. So the way I filmed this, it was handheld off the back of a pickup truck on a dirt road around the campground. So obviously it's not going to be very stable. And it's not with a stabilized lens either. It's with the Sony G Master 16 to 35 lens. Now there's a couple of other options up here. You can look at two up, which shows you the before and after. You can also just look at the after if you're just interested in the results, which is often the time, the thing you want to be looking at. So that's an option. And then the other thing I was going to point out here is this did it all automatically, right? It's kind of like active stabilization on the camera, but we actually have manual control with using the software. And that's what's so powerful about it. So if I just flip back up here to the two up, so we have the before and the after displays, and you go over to the right, it's right now it's at auto. So it's diminished our resolution, which was 3840 by 2160. It's taken down to 2694 by 1515. So it's it's lowered the resolution substantially. But if you click manual right there, this is where you get the control if you want to have a little bit more of that resolution back at the expense of having more camera shake. So by default on this specific clip, it said I need to go in 70%. But you can dial this back, it's just a slider. So if I pull this back and say, Hey, I only want to go in 80% of the original or approximately, let's say 81.1%. You can do that just like that. Take it back to the beginning of the clip with this button, hit play, see if you're happy with it. If you're happy with the results, which generally I've been happy with, I think it goes a little bit too aggressive with some of the smoothness, I like a little bit of, you know, human movement in my shots. I just don't want to be herky jerky. That's how you do that. Next up, all you need to do is kick this sucker out and export. And that's what I'm going to show you next. Let's hit pause and to export the shot. Once you get that set to whatever cropping ratio that you like, you hit this button right here. This is your export button. You can export to your desktop because that's what you you know, should do in a tutorial. Maybe re rename it to put a suffix of, you know, stabilized or something like that. And then by default, I believe it kind of sets it up with pretty good settings for you. So this is an S-Cinetone shot. It's 3840 by 2160. So the render preset is going to give me the same thing right back out at 100 megabits per second. There is a little caveat here. If you shot 10 bit, you're only going to get eight bit out of Catalyst Browse, the free version. So just know that when you go to stabilize, maybe this is something you do after a color grade. And then the the other thing to note is if you just want to do the selected range that in and out points that we had selected, there's a checkbox down here to make sure you do that. The rest of this is all really good. It's encoding for image quality, not speed, because of course we want the best quality as possible. You hit export and it starts cooking the file for you. Okay, it looks like Catalyst Browse just finished up. If I jump over here to my finder to my desktop, we've got our stabilized clip. If I open it up, we can check it out. We can hit info. So we have a 3840 by 2160 clip that it created. It just punched into it. And it's just like I said, it's just that range. It's just that section that we had taken a look at before. And it's nice and smooth. All those micro jitters and whatnot from being in the back of a truck hand holding are gone. That's pretty freaking amazing. Super quick before I move on to the two quick bonus tips I have using Sony Catalyst Browse is that I want to welcome you if you're new here. This is Creative Video Tips. I'm Chadwick and this channel is all about helping you create videos to make a difference and stand out. Lately, I've been putting a lot of Sony camera tips up on the channel, but I have a huge passion for post production and dementia resolve and Final Cut Pro. So if you're into any of that, please subscribe right down below right now so you don't miss out on the next new tips. One thing I love about Catalyst Browse is as you're scrubbing clips, you can actually save any frame as its own JPEG. And the way you do that, it's underneath this more menu. So if you click this, you can say save snapshot. And just like that, boom, it has automatically created a JPEG ready to be used as a thumbnail or email to someone that might be interested in that little frame from your video shoot. The other thing, the other bonus tip I wanted to give you is as long as you save your full card structure, all that metadata with those clips is here for you for when you need to use it for color management and dementia resolve later on. Or if you need to know what apply do I need to apply to it. So if you scroll down here, I can see that the Capture Gamma equation on this was S CineTone, but if it was S log three or S log two, it would tell me that. So that's really, really useful information to give to a colorist. Or if you're yourself or a colorist and you forgot how you shot something, this is where you can find that information out. And it's kind of the only place you can find that information out as far as I know, other than opening the XML file in a text program. But this is a much nicer way to do it. And now you know what are the best kept secrets to smoother footage without using a gimbal. If you learned anything new in this video, please give it a like. And if you want to learn more about using Sony cameras or filmmaking in general, I have some playlist on screen right now that'll help you out. And since there's so much more to learn, I'll see you in that next video.
