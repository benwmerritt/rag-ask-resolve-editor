Blackmagic Designs DaVinci Resolve 18 lets multiple editors, colors, fusion artists, and audio engineers all work together in real time on the same project no matter where you are in the world. It works with a new project library that stores the project files that are hosted on this brand new Blackmagic cloud. But what is so cool about this new workflow is that it's dead simple to set up and use. I'm going to show you. You don't need to know anything about IT, so you can keep on editing anywhere, even in your underwear. We're going to blaze through this multi-user tutorial with help from my friend Jeff today. Say hi Jeff. Hi Jeff. He's a professional colorist working from home and you're going to get to see the power of getting rid of the whole conform process and how you can work together to crank out better, faster work. Create a free user account for Blackmagic cloud to get started. This is how the system can track who's making each change to a project and you can sign up and log in directly from the Blackmagic Design.com webpage in the upper right. You can even do this workflow with the free version of DaVinci Resolve 18. How crazy is that? Just one person needs to spend $5 a month to sort of own the project library. This helps cover the hosting fees, which I don't mind paying because this is so much simpler than using the older Postgres SQL shared database over the internet. And you would have had to pay Amazon web services for that anyway. So just five bucks for one person. However, at any time, you can click this new copy to button to copy the entire project back to a local disk database. Also now known as a local project library. And then you can cancel your monthly $5 fee if you don't need collaboration anymore. And you don't lose any of your work. That's awesome, right? So Blackmagic cloud will store our project files. And in our case today, Jeff and I, we're going to keep our footage on local hard drives and use Dropbox to sync a folder of proxy footage continuously, more in proxies in a second. So Dropbox is the transfer tool, but we both have copies of footage at our work stations. We're not trying to play footage up in the cloud. That would be crazy. It's just the tiny project files that are going up there. So if you want to sync a whole post house to the same office, there's actually a new cloud store cloud mini and cloud pod, and they share media over a 10 gigabit copper ethernet. So it's a super fast NAS, basically, that's network attached storage. It's awesome. And hey, Blackmagic, if you want to send me one to test for the channel, I don't think I'd say no. Anyways, but for today, I'm going to be syncing a Dropbox folder with my Samsung T7 and uploading across my measly 10 meg DSL line to Jeff. I've got a project with 6k red raw footage from the Komodo and a couple of 4k DJI air 2s drone shots, which add up to 80 gigabytes. That's a lot of data to send over the internet. And this is a small project. So the trick to making this all work is to create proxies and DaVinci Resolve 18 has a new standalone app called Blackmagic Proxy Generator. But you might be like, Hey, what the heck is a proxy? Well, it's a stand in. It's like a placeholder, a stunt double. It's a placeholder that's good enough to see and hear what you need to edit a video, even mix a video or start setting a color look. And it's a fraction of the file size of the original footage. It's also easier to play back on older computers. So if you've ever heard the term dailies or rushes, this is what they're talking about. And this is how everything that you see on TV or in the movies is cut. So here's how it works. First, you find an open the app, it's in the applications folder, and it's not inside the DaVinci Resolve application folder. Drag to add a folder with your high resolution 4k, 6k, 8k, and 12k footage. And you have new format options. They're listed based on the lowest to the highest quality, but the compressed H264 and H265, they're all going to be about the same size because they're the same data rate, which is six megabits per second. Also note ProRes here is actually ProRes proxy. And I don't think you're going to have that option on a Windows computer. Click start and let it run. I've been happy to see that all of my M1 Max cores get utilized when transcoding the red raw footage. And obviously the DJI drone footage is going to process much faster than the Komodo stuff. Another thing to point out that makes this new proxy generator tool unique and pretty special is that I can actually continue to edit video into DaVinci Resolve 18 while this is running because it's a different app. Now that the proxies are cooked, we went from 80 gigabytes down to 600 megabytes for this project. That's legit. Even I can upload and push that quickly over my awful internet connection. The proxies are placed next to our original footage in an obvious folder named proxy. They have the same file names to match the original big clip file name. And that's the magic of offline to online editing. And even after doing this for 20 years, it's still magic to me. Now you're going to know that you have proxies working behind the scenes in a couple of ways. One, there's a new badge icon that if you look at the clips in thumbnail view, it has a camera and a film strip. And then two, you should also know about the column view on the media page by right clicking and checking the box for proxy and proxy media path. This is going to tell you the proxy resolution if it's connected and where it lives. If it's not connected, you can right click to connect to any proxy and choose to relink proxy media. Under the playback drop down menu, choose proxy handling. And then I would roll with prefer proxies most of the time. Resolve is going to export the camera originals if they're connected, but use proxies just for easier playback. Choose one of the two other options to see higher resolution footage, which can be helpful for pixel perfect effects and grading. Now I want to get the small proxy files, not the camera originals to Jeff with a sync drop box folder. So after you've clicked stop, you can click the extract proxies button and send them to a drop box sync folder. Over here in finder, I have a whole project with nested folders to stay organized, which I created with a free app called post taste. I'll link that down below. This is what gets synced to Jeff's computer. Hey, I'm waiting on those files. By default, the installed Dropbox app needs the sync preferences set to new files to be available offline. This makes sure you're not trying to access files that are living up in the clouds. It will always store them locally on a hard drive. To share the Dropbox folder, just right click and go down to share and then fill in the email address. To create a black magic cloud project library, click the cloud button in version 18 and add a project library. This sends you over to the website to log in with your new black magic username, and you're going to click to create a project library again down in the lower left. Now pick a server location close to you. I chose California and give it a name just like fight club click create. And this is your prompt to putting your credit card information. I've already done this, so I don't need to make a second library at this moment. So I'm going to hit cancel. You'll see the web interface is the same as the project manager over in Demitri resolve. So in the resolve project manager, if you don't see a list of project libraries, click this button and it's going to expand out. I want to share the creative video tips library with Jeff using his black magic ID. So I'll hit the details button and share and to the email address and you should get an email in his inbox to join the library. Okay, loading projects. I see all your projects. This is an important distinction here. I've given access to all of my projects in this library. It's not just a single project inside it. And right now this is actually a single user project. So as soon as this loads and opens, what you need to do is go under the file menu and then down to multiple user collaboration. This lets both of us get read and write access. And it also disables dynamic project switching, which means you can't hot swap between projects. So it's just like the older shared Postgres SQL database. All right, Jeff, you in the project loading. All right, it's open now that it's open. Is it red or they're offline media? Oh, yeah, it's all offline. It's all offline. Okay, I kind of expected that the first time. So what you're going to do is hit that orange, you know, button that has like the flashers on it, say locate media. And you're going to point it to that Dropbox sync folder that we had all our media sync across. Cool, I found it Dropbox folder. Now you can actually see who's in the project in the lower right section. There's a little icon that's new. And it's got like two little people. If you click on that says who the project members are. So you can see Jeff is in there and I'm in there. And it also tells me, Hey, you're on a Mac, which is great because I like Max. Why don't you click on a bin up in the upper left of the media pool over there in the edit page, click on a bin. So footage. Oh, sweet, you found the footage Komodo folder. I see your initials there, JW popped up there. So the way this works is it's first come first serve. If you're first open a timeline, you're the only one with read and write permission on that timeline. The other one can still read it and copy and paste it to their own timeline. And this is how resolve prevents version conflicts. So now that you're in the Jeff bin, if I click into the Jeff bin and try to open a timeline, it looks like you have two timelines open maybe if I click on the all footage timeline, double click to open it, I can open it and I can see all of the footage there on that all timeline. But the biggest distinction here is that I can't move anything, right? I only have read permission, I don't have right permission. And one way you can tell this is because the toolbar above where there's, you know, there's a selection tool, the trim tool, the blade tool, all of that stuff gets grayed out. Okay. So and if I try to click on a clip and move it with my mouse or, you know, the speed editor, any of these tools, I can't move it at all. But I can take a clip or two of yours. And I can say edit copy. And then I can go to my bin where I have an empty sequence or something. And then I can paste that in with command V. So I'm able to take those clips from one timeline that you owned and place them into a bin or a timeline that I own. Why don't you take that empty timeline and fill it with a couple of the clips that you like. And I will be in my Chadwick bin while you're doing that. Do you have a couple of clips there on your timeline I should check out now? I do. Okay. So I'm going over to the Jeff bin. Okay. By just clicking on it. And it's got a little refresh icon and a little spinny wheel. It took just a second there. And we can see the refresh icons are gone. But if I click on the empty timeline, we in fact have four clips. It looks like he put four clips down on there of this lonely man walking through the desert in New Mexico. Hey, if you see a purple bar above the footage, that just means that you only have the proxies. You don't have the originals. I can continue to make edit changes while you start to color grade this project. Great. I'll move over to color page. Well, you're over there working on clips in the color page. I'm just going to play back some of this so we know what we're looking at and listening to. Okay. We can see he's made some changes. So let's say I'm in the middle of presenting to a client. I don't have to actually take his changes that he's doing to the color grade while I'm in the middle playing back. I get the choice of doing that by clicking this little refresh button that's up in the upper right there. So right now I'm just going to play the beginning of this timeline. You can hear how amazing this video is. What is it that you want for yourself? And why don't you have it already? In order for your life to become what it was meant to be? So it's pretty cool, right? It's got some voiceover. It's got some music. Everything is playing back seamlessly on my M1 Max computer. And even if I jump to the ending clip here, I want the venture resolve 18 collaboration. That's what I want. That's what I want. I want the venture resolve 18 collaboration. I know it's cheesy, right? So on that first shot, I've got that black title that says Black Magic Cloud. If you could just bring the sky up so it's a little bit brighter, it'll pop against the black title that's on top of it. So here's crazy. Oh, geez. Yeah, you really blew that one out. Maybe we don't need to go quite that far with it. Okay. Okay, now that you move to another clip, it shows a badge that's indicated that you're done working on that clip so I can update it on my end. So basically I get the badge as soon as you move away from that clip. All I need to do is click this right here, update, and now it looks legit. It looks normal. I'm happy with that. Good work, Jeff. Thanks. So the other thing to know about bin locking, if you're really concerned about someone getting into your bin is you can go to your bin and you can right click on your bin and then say there's a new option there that you've probably never seen before called lock bins. It's in that fourth section down. If you click lock bins, basically you're saying, hey, only I have access to that bin. Now, just so you know, you don't really need to lock bins, clips, or timelines because if you're the first into it, you've locked it. And as soon as you click away from it, it's unlocked and someone else can take ownership of that bin, clip, or timeline. Oh, another thing you can do if you're going to be first into a bin, but you don't want the full permission is to option and click it all on a PC and you're going to open it and read only mode. You should see an eyeball icon after doing this. And then to release it, you just click it again. Hey, Chadwick, what if two colors want to work on the same timeline at the same time? Well, I'm glad you asked, Jeff. Over here on the color page, we're both in the collaboration three timeline and I can see you're on shot five working on that. So that's locked out. I can't make changes on that shot right now because you're on shot five, right? Yeah, I can do everything I want to do to try to make changes, but I can't. But I can work on the shot right after it shot six. And this shot right here maybe needs to have the exposure brought down a little bit, maybe you need to pump some saturation into it. Maybe make the shot a little colder because it looks like a cold day. We could do that in the HDR controls. If I click on shot five right now, I see you've made this shot super dark and really moody, but like it's almost like day for night. I love it. So that's basically how that works. You could actually have, you know, five colorists working on a single timeline at once. It's super, super powerful. So another really useful tool in DaVinci Resolve is the chat window, which is something that's unique to any NLE that I know about. It's this little button right down here. So I can quickly type a message to Jeff because he's in the project, like, you know, have you subbed to CVT yet? You know, and of course he has, right? But in all reality, the way this is really useful is if you need to make notes about changes and you're not on a zoom call like the two of us are right now, or if you just need access to a specific bin, and then I'll just go over here and then to right click, I can say unlock bins. The thing about Dropbox Sync that's super cool with it being bi-directional is Jeff can create a disclaimer over there on his computer. Cool. Okay, I just dragged it from the Dropbox Finder window into the Chadwick Cuts folder, and now I'll bring it into the timeline. All right, let's hit refresh a different way this time. I'm going to right click and say refresh bins. And that should give me the changes over here. And if I go to the end of my timeline, there we go, we got a disclaimer. I need to change the position of this title so that we can see the whole disclaimer because this is really important information to read. The next thing I want to do is actually show the other way. This is going to be super quick, but I'm going to record a voiceover to add at the end of this video so that Jeff can get the voiceover as well. And we're going to go to the Fairlight page to record the voiceover. This is how easy it is to create a voiceover in the Venture Resolve. I'm going to close this collaboration chat window because it's in the way. So you always need to check your preferences over here. So I've got input set to Scarlet Solo, which is my microphone and used for screen flow. The other thing you need to do is under Project Settings, make sure underneath the Capture and Playback section that your save clips is getting set to your cloud collaboration, your Dropbox folder because that's the way that he's going to make sure to be able to get these right after I record. So now what I'm going to do is change my input away from AirPods and we're going to say input is actually Scarlet Solo USB. We're going to patch that in. We'll hit X. And then to record, it's really simple. You're just going to hit record and I should see levels, but we have this echo thing. The way you get rid of that is you hit the while you hit record. And now I can still hear what I'm recording because I've got direct monitor out of the Scarlet Solo USB. I'm going to hit record. And then I'm going to record this amazing voiceover in a world. The Venture Resolve helped creatives collaborate in their boxers. All right, I'm going to stop it right there. That was pretty terrible. But I can disarm this and I can go back over here to the edit page. And I'm going to put this at the end of that other timeline by a quick copy, go back to my collaboration three project. And I'm going to just paste this in right here. And I need to see the waveform. So I'm going to expand this out. I know that it was right around here where the voiceover started in a world. The Venture Resolve helped creatives collaborate in their boxers. All right, it's amazing, right? The best voiceover you ever heard. And it's going to go right over here on this ending disclaimer section. All right, so Jeff, now on the edit page, if you open up that same timeline, Dropbox should have just synced that voiceover recording that I just recorded right now on your timeline, which is on your hard drive at your house. Why don't you give it a playback and see how it sounds? Sure. In a world. What do you think of collaboration here in the Venture Resolve? Oh, it's amazing. It's pretty cool, right? Yeah. Hey, there's one last thing I got to show you. It's called Timeline Comparison Mode. Okay. So the way it works is you select the other timeline you want to compare against by right clicking it, and then you can go down to compare with current timeline. When you check that and click that box, you can drag the slider in the upper right there to drag down and sort of see the whole thing. And you can see the areas that are different, right? This area that's highlighted is different. You can also click on the left here where it says different index, and it'll give you a whole list of all the differences. This only has one. And basically, there's a legal disclaimer that we put on version three, and I want to put that on version four. So the way we get that to happen is just a right click, say accept change, and now we have the legal disclaimer that was on three, it's put on four. So that's a quick way, if you're just going to update a couple of graphics or something between two projects, to get them to all be the same. I hope you found this tutorial helpful and feel comfortable diving into collaborative video editing with the Venture Resolve 18. Hey, I'm Chadwick. This is Creative Video Tips. It's here to help you create videos that make a difference in standout. I am so thankful for your time as always. Ask me down in the comments any questions you have because I love answering them. And because there is so much more to learn, I'll see you in that next video. This should be something great to learn on screen right now. Hey, Jeff, if people need editing or color correction, how can they find you? Jeff Wilson, .tv.
