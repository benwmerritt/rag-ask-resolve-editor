Capturing great audio that you can actually hear. Capturing great audio that you can actually hear. And loud places like this or other loud places underground like this. Like this. Then syncing that. With footage from the brand new Blackmagic iPhone Camera app, it's easy by just using the timecode from the tentacle trackie. Let me show you how. So clearly I'm no Casey Neistat, but I'm back in my studio, so I'm going to break this into three steps today. The first one, we're going to be going through a quick little review. There's going to be a chapter mark after that, so you can skip ahead if you want. On my best practices, how do you set the app up? What settings should you be choosing? And then we'll wrap up with my bread and butter, right? Which is teaching DaVinci Resolve. I've got two different ways that I can show you how you can sync timecode. And that way you can pick what works best for you, including a couple fixes in case your timecode doesn't match exactly. I personally have found seven problems that this thing has solved that no other device has done so far, even though it's three years old. The first of which is I have no more radio transmission dropouts from like extra Wi-Fi or cellular activity. It's because you're actually recording dual system sound. You've got video going to your phone, audio going to the tentacle trackie. You marry them up later in DaVinci Resolve. It's a beautiful thing. The second problem these things have solved for me is I have no more distorted clipped audio when I'm recording with a lav mic on someone. And that's because they have 32-bit float audio. It means there's actually, there's two analog to digital converters in here, but you don't have to know any of that stuff. All you need to know is you plug it in, you put a mic on someone, you have the ability to lower things so that you'd never have that distorted sound when you get into post-production. The third problem these tentacle trackies solve is that there are timecode devices which makes them really easy to sync because the start number of the file on the audio file is the same as the starting number that's on the video file. It also means that you can easily shoot in loud environments, places around New York City or trade shows, weddings, anywhere where you are okay with the talent getting far away from the mic and then you want them to come back later and still have great audio that whole time. Oh, and the other big benefit to syncing with timecode is you can turn your camera on and off all day long with no worries that you'll be able to sync it later without doing that annoying hand clap. And also because these are timecode devices, they work with other timecode devices just fine. You can take a deity TC1 that I actually like as well. You can plug a 3.5mm cable into here, send it out into the tentacle trackie. It'll take the timecode and you have everything synced up that way as well. These things offer you a way to shoot with a really small footprint. I'm meaning you can just shoot with your phone, no extra hard drives, no extra cages, no extra stuff coming off of it because it's actually really simple to sync afterwards. A phone, a tentacle trackie, and a microphone, a loud mic, and you're set. The next problem that these guys have solved is the fact they have a 10 hour battery. That means you turn it on, you start recording, and you don't have to worry about it at all throughout the day. There's some other ones that I have and they cap out around four hours and you're worried, do I need to take it off someone and recharge it? No, you just set it on someone and forget it. Well, don't totally forget it, you still need to take it off them at the end of the day. The next solution that these have that I haven't seen in other devices is how they're built. They're built really well. There's a clip on the back, listen to this thing. That's not coming off someone's belt or waist, and they have a locking microphone input. So if you get a mic that has a screw on plug, you put that in there, you screw it in, and you never have to worry about this thing coming out at any point during your shoot. This is a COS-11, but at the end of this video I'm going to demo a couple different mics so you can hear how they sound plugged into the tentacle trackie. You can disable the buttons so that the person that's wearing it can't turn it off. And that's a good thing because that means you don't have to worry about resyncing it and re-jaming the timecode at any point during the day. Now there is one big issue. I know this probably sounds like an ad right now, but trust me, I bought these with my own money. I just love them these much and I think they're so, so helpful. But the problem is that you're kind of flying blind with your ears the whole time. You don't actually get to hear what's being recorded because it's not being sent wirelessly. It's also kind of a feature, but just know that going in. For me, myself, I've been okay with the fact because there's 32-bit float audio, so I don't really have to worry about the record clipping at all. And as long as you get some lav concealer tape from Bubble Bee Industries, it's a good one to use, which will stick really well to someone along with their lav concealers, which is going to make sure that one, that the top of the mic is not getting rustled by a shirt. And the other thing is it gives you a nice flat, low-profile thing to stick onto someone's chest. Do that with some transport tape and you should be pretty good, unless the person's like super sweaty. Okay, so you got your tentacle trackie. You fire it on. You download the tentacle app. If you already have tentacle sinkies, it's the same app. Let's open it up. You'll see your list of devices there. The one I'm working with right now is called Batman. To change device names, by the way, just go to the Settings tab on the far right. And here you have device name. You can change the name here in this field. And this metadata carries over into DaVinci Resolve. So if you want to name your actors and have that carry across, that can be really useful. But recording format, you want to make sure you tap on 48 kilohertz 32-bit float. The setting in here that I love is this idea that there's this user switch assignment down at the bottom. And you can change the assignment to say not used. By default, I think it does start and stop recording. But I like not used because what that means is there's a button on the side here. The person wearing it can't turn off the recording, which is a good thing because that can break your jam on your timecode to all your other devices. So I turn that to not used. And then the big piece of timecode syncing and all this stuff in Magic for it to work is your frame rates need to match. So think about your frame rate ahead of time and jam this thing. So the way you jam from the app is there's a little button at the bottom with a little, looks like a time indicator. And this is where you choose your timecode. So I'm choosing 2997. And it's going to take 726 in the morning. It's going to sync to here. And when it does, it starts flashing green on here. I don't know if you can see that, but we are basically we're seeing we got verified timecode and we're flashing green. So just hit the record button right down there in the middle. And we have a flashing red light. Let's go to the Blackmagic Camera app. And there's just a couple settings here to look at the first one. Make sure your frame rates the same 2997. Then go down to settings in the settings section. The first time you do this, you have to make sure you enable Bluetooth for the app. There'll be a permissions thing, just accept it. And that's found it down towards the bottom under accessories, use Bluetooth. Make sure that's enabled. And then you want to also go up and be mindful of where you're saving your clips. That's under the media section. And I prefer to save my clips to in-app only because then I'll use AirDrop afterwards to send the full rest files. And it's really easy to batch those. I'm going to show that next. And then at the very top is the magic of the tentacle sync in here. You have timecode display. Instead of just being record run in time of day, you have tentacle sync. And then this device was called Batman. So make sure that's chosen. You can go back to your camera. And this number that's up at the top there is 73918. That's our time of day timecode, which was generated and being fed from this. So these will now sync up. Just record on here. Do whatever you want. The main goal I would say is leave this thing running all day. And next up I'm going to show you how to pull the files into your computer. Full disclosure here. I know there's other ways to transfer files from your phone to the computer. But for me, AirDrop works great because I'm using an iPhone 14 Pro that doesn't have the newest fastest cable connections. And AirDrop is actually faster. So to batch import the video files from the Blackmagic Cam app using AirDrop, click the files app. Go to On My iPhone. Then you should have a Blackmagic Cam app folder. Just click that. Inside there we have media. And then you just navigate to the files that you want. I know these are at the bottom of my list right here from actually several weeks ago. But to batch select them and bring them in. In the upper right, there's a three dot options menu. And then from here you can choose select. And this is what is going to allow me to sort of drag, swipe to select the four clips that I want to bring in for this particular video that was in the intro. Hit the share sheet button. That's the bottom left with the little arrow pointing up. We're going to choose AirDrop. And then it's going to find computers that have Wi-Fi on and the vicinity. Just tap that. They have been imported. One of them is almost half a gigabyte because they're 4K files. I do suggest you use HEVC unless you have some reason to shoot ProRes on your phone. You save a lot of space and there's not a big quality difference. I guess the exception would be if you're using the new Apple log format on the iPhone 15s. And copy and paste them out of your downloads folder. Throws them in the downloads automatically. I'm going to throw them into this New York City folder which has all the job elements for my specific project in it. And the last thing you need to do is get the files off of the tentacle track E which you need to do with a good old fashioned USB-C cable. I brought my audio clips in here and I did not follow my own advice and had multiple clips because I want to show you how you can fix these. If we just select them and drag them in, you might have a frame rate problem right off the bat. So I encourage you, before you do anything else in a new DaVinci Resolve project, check your frame rate. That's this little gear icon in the lower right for project settings, master settings, and just make sure your timeline frame rate is going to be set to what you want because once you bring stuff in, you can't change this later. Hit cancel because we're good to go. And we'll pull all our footage in here. And if you're in this thumbnail view, it's nice because you can see things visually. But to see actual timecode and sort things a little better, this list view can be really handy. So click that. And the clip name will let you sort things in order. We're going to basically start by creating a timeline sync. So this is method one. It's not the one I use all the time, but I want to show you it as an option. And it's also a way that you can visually sort of check your sync. So if we go to the cuts bin right here, I'm going to create a new timeline. Create a new timeline. We'll just call this timeline sync. Everything else is fine about it. We're going to take our footage. And this is a key different thing that maybe you've never seen before. We're going to be throwing our timeline clips to the timeline based on their timecode. Here's how that works. We're going to select shift, select them, right click and say insert selected clips to timeline using timecode. Right? It's the fourth thing down. And when I do this, you're like, the timeline just went crazy. There's nothing there, but there is something in my timeline viewer. Well it's because what it's done, if I scroll over here, it's taking the start timecode value and placed it at the exact same number on your timeline, which if I hit home on my timeline, it begins at hour one. But our footage now, if I hit the down arrow, is dropped under the timeline at the same value of the source clip, 8.45 in the morning. So that can be really useful because you can also see gaps of when a camera stopped and started. See that? So that's kind of a bonus tip. Now I don't want any of this audio that's down here. It's rubbish from the iPhone. I'm going to option drag to select it, delete it, and then I'm going to be pulling in the good audio that has timecode from the technical track E. Before I do that, I'm going to change my track down here from stereo, which is generally the default, to be mono. So I'm going to say change track type to mono. And just select these guys, and then this time we're just going to drag these down here. This is a big thing about syncing in the timeline. You can only sync one video track per one audio track at the same time. So this is going to be a step by step, like a clip by clip basis. So I do have another method, and that's how I generally sync coming up right after this. But let's get through this because I want to show you how this works. You can select both clips, right click, say auto-align clips based on timecode. That moved that into sync. Select these two clips, right click, auto-align clips based on timecode, right click. Auto-align clips based on timecode, selecting both auto-align clips based on timecode. So let's go to this clip right here. I'm using up and down to get to the top and tail of the clip. And then syncing that with footage from the brand new Blackmagic iPhone camera. You can see right away we're clipping like crazy down here. So the way I would treat this as soon as they're on the timeline is I would select them all, right click, change to normalize audio levels, and negative nine sample peak with end dependent is going to treat them individually. This is a great starting point for any dialogue, hit normalize, and it brings them all down because it's 32 bit flow. We should not have had any distortion. Let's take a listen. Check iPhone camera app is easy. See it's gotten rid of all that extra distortion. Now I want to check sync because I know from a fact that even jam sync timecode stuff is not always perfectly in sync. So I'm going to show you how to fix that on the timeline. Let's take our last clip down here where I do a clap so I can show this. I'm going to hit command B to whack off the end of that. Command B to take off the end of that. Let's take a listen here. Okay we have a clap. Let's step it through. Hit shift S, it turns scrubbing on and off. So I just turn it off, it's silent. I turn it back on with shift S again. You hear that? We have about two maybe three frames. Clap and I still, my hands haven't come together for one, two more. So I'm going to call it, it's about two frames off. And I can probably know that pretty much everything on here is going to be about two frames off. The video is coming late because it takes longer to encode or something like that. Video is slower than the audio as far as writing the files. So I'm going to take the video files, move them back two frames so that they're in line. I'm just going to select this one clip and do two times with the period key. Right? They call it, is this button right here? That's going to take us back two frames, one, two. Now we should be in sync. Let's take a listen to that clap. Thinking that with... Very good. With footed. Right? So that is sunk and you can link these so that they don't drift later on. You select them, right click and say link selected clips. Now if you move them around, they move as like a bundle, like a single unit. The other thing with dropping all these to the timeline, just using timecodes, you've got these big gaps. There's an easy fix for that. And that is actually found up under the edit menu. Go down to this one right here, delete gaps. And what that's done, if I come back here to the timeline, it's getting rid of all that extra space that was down there. So you know, you can work from here. The other way to sync into Venture Resolve is in the media pool. And that's what I prefer because it's a lot less clicks. And it still does allow for adjusting for the timecode being offset. So that's what I'm going to show you next. Let's head on over to the media pool just to be in a different space. And over here, there is a column called audio offset. This is one I like to have open. It's available right up here. And the reason I like to have this available is it just lets me know if I have synced audio and kind of what it's adjusted to. So I'm almost always having that available. And we know there's about a three frame offset. So what I need to do is change the timecode values on either the video clips or the audio clips. So we know the video is about two frames too late. So if we want to make the audio two frames late, we would say plus two on timecode offset. So I'm going to modify the audio timecode to be plus two relative to what the video is before you sync. You got to do this before you sync. So I'm going to right click and say clip attributes, go to timecode. It's a third tab over there. Do plus two and just do rinse and repeat for these others. Clip attributes, plus two, clip attributes, plus two. I've taught in another tutorial there's a way you can actually batch change the offset on video clips when you import them. And that's in my deity TC1 video. If you want to learn how to do that, I just want to show you a different way that you can do with audio. It's just you can't do it on import. Now that those are all done, you just right click to select them, right click. And there's an option called AutoSync Audio based on timecode. It doesn't get simpler than that. And it happens instantaneously. Check this out. Click. And now you can see audio offset was just applied to all those. So we have sunk those clips. Let me take you over to the edit page so you can kind of see what happens when you modify timecode and we can just check our work. You can see our timeline. We all of a sudden we have these clips that I have no conform anymore. And the problem was because we changed timecode. This is an important thing. Whenever you change timecode values in here, you could really mess things up. So you want to be doing that before you do any editing. Just choose one of these methods. Don't choose both because you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble. If you're doing the media pull sync, which is what I do, do it very at the very beginning and don't change anything afterwards. Back over here, we'll check our work. These clips right now, if I double click any of these new master clips and you go to the audio track you can see, we have just our single 32 bit float audio attached. We could throw these to a new timeline if we wanted to by right by selecting all of them with the shift select, right clicking and saying create new timeline using selected clips. In this situation, it did put the correct mono track down there. It was smart enough to know that. Let's test our sync. Let's go back to this clip right here. Before we do that, let's normalize them so we're not hurting our ears. Right click, normalize audio level, sample P program independent. Let's take a listen and see how well we did this method. And then syncing that with... Go back. Go back. That. Perfect, right? With footage from the brand new Blackmagic iPhone camera app, it's easy. And so there's the two methods to sync with timecode. You've got the timeline method and the media pool method. I prefer the media pool method, but you really just need to pick one. And I thought for the mic test it'd be best to be outside where you'd probably want to use the mic. I'm using the Sankin KOS 11, that's what you're hearing right now, the Sankin KOS 11. It's taped to my chest right underneath my T-shirt, so just... Even though I have a hoodie on, it's just one little bit of fabric. This is what the Sankin KOS 11 sounds like. This is what the Rode Lavalier 2 sounds like. But it's taped to my chest with a Bubble Bee Blob concealer. And it's freezing outside right now. I don't know if you can see my breath, but this is the sacrifices I make to try to bring you stuff that might help you make better videos. So at the end of the day, who do I think the tentacle trackie is best for? Well, if you're a school or a church or a small business or a content creator, this is really the best way to level up your audio because you can get the microphone closer to the source. And with the new iPhone app, you don't have to worry about necessarily going out and buying a separate camera because you can use the timecode to sync it even in the free version of DaVinci Resolve. Hey, I appreciate you so much. And because there is so much more to learn, I'll see you in the next video.
