Start by launching a Firefox and then we're going to be going over to the Google and find a get firebug search for firebug and let's grab the firebug add on extension down here for firefox and this extension should work fine. I'm assuming we'll click add to firefox and see the add on is what they're calling them. It's all set we're saying yeah I trust it let's install it firefirebug will install after you restart so let's go ahead and restart. Okay so we have firebug installed now. To use firebug there is a it used to be on the lower right but now it's up here in the upper right this little switch here. If we click that it gives us some information on what is running on the web page that's open. Okay in order to find where video is pulling from we need to do a couple things down here. First thing we'll do is click on this dot net or this net switch here and we need to enable that. Right now what that we are on a page that we have some video that we want to download this is some stuff for real for nicklofting. We needed to pull one of these down to show client. What we would do is quickly just click this little bug looking thing up here in the upper right. This is firebug you click on there it's going to load up a screen on the bottom down here. Everything that is loading on a page no matter what website it is is going to show and what we're going to be looking for is the biggest thing. It's always the video pretty much on any website these days that I've come across. You'll see the bar fill up as it progressively downloads and this is how we're going to get the source video. So what we'll do now is we have to refresh the page for stuff to show up on there. So if you hit command R start refreshing the page you can see the video is starting to play up there. Meanwhile down at the bottom we have this gray bar that's filling up. You'll see it just finished downloading it's 18.2 megabytes so we know that's definitely the video clip. Now to download it it's pretty simple. All we need to go over here is to the FLV which is the video source and if we just command click right click on it it'll ask us you know do we want to open up this specific file. We just want to click on save file and click okay and you can't see it because it's already downloaded but over here my other window which I'll drag over we have the video so basically that's all there is to it. And now you can see I have the actual video file downloaded to my computer so I can recompress it if I need to distribute to client get approval anything like that. Don't use this to steal video that you're not supposed to have. Hit me up with any questions you got and see you next time. Bye.
