Did you know that almost everything you see on TV or in the movies uses a transition on every single cut even if they're just audio crossfades? That's a lot of transitions. Today I want to show you the Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve Speed Editor has five dedicated keys to help make this process of putting transitions down easier. And I've also got some great keyboard shortcuts and mouse tips to get you going with Resolve 17. Let's check it out. The DaVinci Resolve Speed Editor has three buttons right here. These three keys cut, dissolve, smooth cut, and the right underneath the trimming buttons. But also if you look at the computer screen in the cut page we have the same ones over here we have cut, dissolve, and smooth cut. So if you don't have the speed editor yet you can use these buttons and sort of follow along. Alright the first one here that confused me is cut. So cut does not actually split a clip meaning cut it in half. So if I hit cut you can see it didn't actually cut the clip. If we go up here the button you want to use is split. If you want to actually cut the clip I don't know why they didn't call. The terminology is kind of messed up. I'm going to double tap escape to undo that. It's also just so you know it has nothing this cut has nothing to do with the edit cut button that's up here in the menu for copying and pasting. So just know that. What cut is actually going to do is it's going to strip off any transition that's on your timeline based off of your smart indicator. So this little triangle here is on this dissolve. If I hit cut it strips it right off. Now that's great and Danny for just one or two at a time you can strip those off with a cut button. But what if you have like a whole timeline of transitions that you want to replace and do something different with. If you hit shift four to go to the edit page command A selects all your clips and now if you hit the cut button it takes all those transitions off. So you probably saw right there there were some other dissolves. That's a really quick way to get rid of lots of transitions. Next we're going to look at the dissolve button and a dissolve is a pretty magical thing. It's going to be your most commonly used deal. We're going to hit dissolve and it's going to fade from one clip to the next. It's going to sort of blend those together really smoothly. Now you're going to a lot of times you're going to use a dissolve. You're going to change show like a change in time or location. But one thing that I found really useful that you're going to use all the time is a cross fade. So if you jump to the edit page I'll show you what I'm talking about. Let's zoom in command plus and the cross fade is just down there on the audio and what that's doing is it's making a smooth transition so there's no pops or clicks between the cut. Because in video editing software if you're unaware if you make a cut it's going to make a pop or click because you're going to have a waveform that's not going to cut at a zero crossing. So this is a really quick way to sort of clean those up. However one thing you notice is it put a cross dissolve on this clip and a cross fade. That is basically how this dissolve button works. It's good if you have links video and audio and you're in here in the cut page it's going to do both at the same time. What if you don't want that? Let me show you how to do that. So the way we're going to put a cross fade only and not a dissolve on the picture part is to hit shift E on the keyboard. Okay and what that's done is it sort of highlighted it green down there you can see and after the shift E is is sort of selected we can hit shift T is going to do a cross fade only. Okay the reason I did the shift E first is because it actually gives you a little bit more control and I'll show you more about that later. To demonstrate smooth cut I want to show you an interview clip real quick and that's how we're going to be using smooth cut. I met Santino my senior year of high school and when I first met him I just completely fell for him. Okay we heard that and I want to get rid of that. That's a really common thing to do when you're editing is you're going to cut out the word uh. So we could do that by hitting split on the keyboard and then we could hit we're going to go to the side here and we'll hit trim in and that gets rid of that uh so if we listen to it again. We see her head kind of shake there so what smooth cut is going to do or is going to attempt to do is use optical flow which is a technology that kind of blends the frames together magically so we'll hit smooth cut that drops that on there and it takes a second to render and the other thing is that black magic suggests that you only use smooth cut with a duration of two to four frames so we're going to get to this button a second but if I hold the duration button here we can kind of dial in we're going to say four frames okay we're going to say that transitions four frames we'll roll it back here with the search dial hit play. And it kind of made that cut actually work so this is one of the times I can count on maybe one single hand that I've ever used smooth cut and it worked. I just want to show you that it actually can work so give it a shot sometime but it's probably the most useless button on this entire speed editor so I wish they really hadn't dedicated a whole button to it but it's there that's how it works so use it if you're in a bind you don't have b-roll to cut to during an interview. Before we move on to the next section I want to let you know these buttons actually work a little differently with live overwrite which I have a whole tutorial on setting up a sync bin and doing multicam and what these are going to let you do is see these little glowing sections here if I hit live overwrite we have an option now dissolve is glowing in red we can actually paint on a clip with a dissolve and the way that works is if that's selected and we go back to our timeline and paint a new clip on so I'll just hit play. Because we the first time we met we went rock climbing well we tried to go rock climbing. She says well we try to go rock climbing what if we want to cut to angle to with a dissolve I'm just going to pull this back and then we met we went rock climbing well and I've just hit cam 2 button and while I held that down you can see it actually dropped a clip down there with a dissolve hit timeline to review it we went rock climbing well we tried to go rock climbing that didn't happen so that's one way you can use it it's not really in my preference at all to be adding a dissolve when you're doing a multicam but it can be done and that's kind of what that's there for and how you could use it now that you know about cut dissolve and smooth cut using the speed editor I've got a tip using the mouse to create transitions that you may have never seen before so about everybody knows you can modify transition by clicking and dragging with your mouse but what a lot of people don't know if we hit cut right here is just using your mouse you can select a clip and you can hold option shift on the keyboard click and drag and it automatically creates a new crossfade for you so that's a nice little mouse track you just click to select a clip option shift and drag and that creates a you know a crossfade on the audio and a dissolve on the video for you pretty slick speaking of the mouse why was the mouse afraid of the speed editor because the search style has catlike reflexes so we are cruising along and the next button on the speed editor I want to show you is transition duration and set so transition duration the way this is going to work is this going to set how long the duration is on your cut that you're dropping so if you hold it down and then you grab the search dial and move that it's going to make it longer and shorter so the bonus tip or the extra little magic sauce that happens with the set button here is one it's you drop that down and we have this we saw we have this set now I'm going to roll it to exactly one second once that set if you double tap that has set a new default that every single time I put down a new dissolve or transition it's going to put it to that exact length so let's go to another section and why don't we drop one right here's a section where it could use one let's put a dissolve there and we can see it put that to exactly one second and we know that because if you hold transition duration again and start to scroll it it was one second the fifth button I want to show you on the speed editor for transitions is the trans slash title button which is right up here and the way this is actually going to work you can use it to modify or add a transition that's not a cut dissolve or smooth cut as long as it's not a one of these brand new at the bottom they have these fusion fusion transitions as long as it's not a fusion transition you can edit it right there with that button so we're going to do that we're going to hold this down so it's a tap hold and when you do that it gives you all the options in the world it's a lot of stuff you probably won't use very often but it's still a lot of fun to be able to use with the search dial so let's choose barn door or release it and we can see the barn door transition has been applied and it's actually it's also if you notice from our last tip this has been set to the one second duration that we had preset as a sort of our our transition length that we want to be using so if I want to make that shorter again and go back to that let's make it a real fast like 12 seconds so it's like a half second one and double tap that gets us a real quick wipe as it goes into that next shot so and it's super easy to go back and change it to a different type of transition if you don't like that one you just hold transition down use the search dial and you can choose any one of these incredible transitions including my favorite start wipe let's check it out magical quickly I want to call a timeout and say welcome if you're new here my name is Chadwick this is creative video tips where I help you create videos that make a difference and stand out if that's something you're into and you haven't already done so click subscribe right down below so you don't miss out on the tip next week now with that other way let's come back and resolve because I've got some great keyboard shortcuts they're going to help you out with transitions to speed up your editing in the edit page so to get to the edit page we're going to be hitting shift four that takes us over there and we need to drop a transition on here to begin with we'll use the speed editor we'll hit dissolve okay and when we did that one thing to note and I would suggest you set up and resolve is to change your crossfade audio type by default we can see over here in the specter it is set to crossfade zero to B that's not great we want to change that actually and so we're going to hit cut to remove the transition we're going to change that over here in our if you go to your effects library auto transitions we have crossfade plus 3db this is the one you're going to want to use most of the time don't ask me why just set a standard transition and you're going to be super happy but what I want to do now is actually just put those plus 3db crossfades on every single clip to get rid of those pops and clicks the way we're going to do that is with the command shift t by hitting shift t we can see we just put crossfades on every single clip down there in the timeline and so that's just going to smooth things out and get rid of any pops and clicks and so here are my next four favorite keyboard shortcuts we're going to hit V and I the way I use V is for VINBetweens because it's going to go VINBetween the clips and then we're going to be hitting U to cycle the side of the clip that we're actually selected so you can see right here we're on the left side only but if we use U which I call other side like other we're going to tap U and that cycles between them so right here we're selecting both the left and the right of the clip and here we're selecting the right side only okay we'll tap it one more time or two more times we'll be in the middle and then the next one is T for transition so we have V for VINBetween U to cycle the other side and then T is going to be a transition we're going to be dropping a transition with command T okay that's going to be putting them on both at the same time both the video and audio I'm going to hit command Z to undo or you could do shift T which we've talked about which just does the audio section only command T to undo that or guess what else we got option T does just the video side my final keyboard shortcut I want to make sure I show you because if you watch my trimming video I showed you a way that was probably more complicated than needed be to do a J or L cut with the speed editor so what we're going to be doing is using option E okay option E is going to select the video track and once that is selected you can just hit roll on the speed editor hold it down and then move it and you have a J or L cut the other thing is if you haven't seen that video that's a big limitation in the cut page over here shift 3 is you cannot do a J or L cut when you're in this page now we're going to take a look at using the transitions browser to add transitions to a lot of clips at once so here we are in the cut page we can see we've got all the clips we're going to hit command A to select them all and if we want to apply the same transitions to all the clips at once one way to do that is if you go to the transition browser and let's say we want to be putting an iris on everything you get right click here and say it is called add to selected edit points and clips and we can see we have now added that to every single transition to make the most amazing video of lots of irises you could see there's probably a lot better uses for this maybe if it's a slideshow or something but that is how that's done now if we just want to add a transition to one of them using the mouse we're going to select all of these and we're going to hit cut to remove our transitions hopefully you learned that one by now and we can just go to any edit point with the search style that we want to be adding a transition and we can say it's just a simple click and drag of that transition and it can be dragged to the top timeline here or it could be dragged down here these both work in the cut page so if you're unfamiliar with that they are working together at the same time so one thing I want to make sure you understand about transitions is they need handles and a handle basically is the part that you've already trimmed out on the timeline a transition will use that part to smooth things out so if you run out of handles let me show you what it looks like we're going to be removing this cut that's right there and we'll go ahead and trim this shot all the way out till it gets to the red point and why don't we go and take the other side we'll hit trim on this one and extend it till it's red so if we look at these two clips right now we cannot trim either side right if we trim in or trim out that's red and so what's going to happen when we try to put a transition on this is it flashes if we hit the dissolve button on here if we take one from over here let's go let's do something different how about aero iris on this one we're going to click and drag that down there it doesn't even do anything what happens if we right click it we say I want to say add to select it edit points and clips it gives us this error we can say trim clips or skip clips if we click choose trim clips it's basically taking the same amount from both sides to apply it I'm going to hit undo to undo that and the other option here is going to be we say add to select the clips and we choose skip clips that's useful if you have multiple clips selected and it's just kind of going down in a row if there's no handles available if you learned at least one thing in this video please make sure to give it a like and if you want to learn more about DaVinci Resolve the speed editor there's a playlist popping up right over here right now and I've got all kinds of tips on using multicam the search style cut page edit page trimming there's so much to learn so I'll see you over in that next video
