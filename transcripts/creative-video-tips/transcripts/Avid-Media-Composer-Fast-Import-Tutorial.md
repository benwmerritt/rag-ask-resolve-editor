Okay, it's Chadwick again. What I want to do in this quick tutorial is show you how to fast import clips into Avid with dailies that we had previously made with DaVinci Resolve. First thing we're going to do is create a new project called the project avid fast import tutorial. And we want to make sure the format here matches what the source files were that we created in resolve the dailies. For these ones I had them 25 frames per second. Normally you're going to be at 23976 and color space will always be YCBCR709. Also it's always a good idea to check the film box here to 35 mil for perf so that you have the option of more accurately syncing your dailies to the production audio. Okay, click OK and click OK. I'll zoom out here. And we're loaded up. And what I'm going to do first is just rename the default bin to import. It's like a standard import except it's a fast import. So the difference being is that we've already created the material at the right codec that we want to edit in. So do that we right click in the bin say import. And we go to change the resolution to DNX 36, which is the resolution that we had made in resolve. We want to make sure we keep an eye on where we're putting our stuff. I want this to go in media six. This is always going to default to the large volume that has the most space, which kind of sucks because you know, that's not always where we want to put the footage. Keep an eye on that as always. Under options, you want to first look at under image, make sure your file pixel to video mapping set to 709 HD, which it is. And under the AF on feed tab here, you want to change this to make sure it says use the source files resolution. This is what's going to make sure that it does not get transcoded. Okay, because we don't want it to on this, click OK. And we can select the three clips that we've made resolve and open. And once it gets going here, I'm going to say fast import a video quick time. And there it is, it's fast import. Those are all here down in our bin. And we want to quickly throw these to a timeline, get the name and command E to sort them, and then just add them straight on down. And here you can see, very quickly, we created our dailies in resolve, applied a little contrast to them. And now we finally, we brought the footage into avid doing a fast import. So we're editing managed DNx 36 media, that will be happy. You know, you can edit all day long with this stuff.
