Today we're going to talk about why you want to make sure you always buy a 64 gigabyte or larger SD card when filming video with your camera. Welcome if you're new here, my name is Chadwick. This is Creative Video Tips where I help you create videos that make a difference in standout. If that's something you're into, I would love it if you would click subscribe right now so you don't miss my tip next week. Now why do you want a 64 gigabyte SD card? What's so special about it? I mean I've got an 8 gigabyte card here from maybe 10 years ago that I moved up to 16 and 32. All three of these here are considered SDHC cards, so HC at the end. When they stepped up and they started making 64 gig cards and bigger, like right now here I've got a 256 gig card which is quite large. It went to SDXC. So the difference between SDHC and SDXC besides that letter is actually really significant. They changed the file format of how things are stored on these little disks. So it went from Fat32 to XFAT. And what that means for us when we're making videos is that you can only store a 4 gigabyte video file on these older SDHC cards. So after 4 gigabytes, the file just stops on the camera. And it starts a new one and it usually doesn't drop a frame while it's happening. But that can be a pain when you're going to edit and you have multiple files that you have to bump right up and stitch next to each other when it's the same shot that kept rolling. So SDXC alleviates that because you're larger than 4 gigabyte files and it's pretty much unlimited. So when you're recording 4K files and you have these higher data rates like the Sony A73 that I'm shooting on right now or even this ARX100 up above, this is shooting like 100 megabytes per second when it's doing 4K. So it's going to fill that much quicker. Now just a word of warning, you're still limited by whatever your camera's recording limits are. So if you have one from a few years back, like both of these cameras are a couple years old, they have a 30 minute record limit for video, which is like a European tax thing, which is still better if you remember if you've been doing this for a while, I had a Canon T2i and that had a 12 minute record limit for 1080p video. So the newer ones though, they don't have record limits, most of them at least. So if you get yourself a 64 gig or larger SDXC card, you're not going to run into the camera wanting to turn off because it just can't write to that format that's on the card. Give you another bonus tip and sort of point you to another video I have on UHS2 and why I think that's important. So if you have a little extra money to spend or are really concerned about a quick turnaround, you might consider UHS2 because some of the cameras support that nowadays. It's a type of card that has an extra set of pins on the back so you can transfer your footage two, three times faster to your computer as long as you use a correct SD card. So it'll be like a pop up or something that'll take you to that video if that's something you're into. I would just say as a word of warning, while there's a lot of Black Friday deals out there and holiday specials on cheap SD cards, if you're shooting video, go for 64 gigs or larger. And that's pretty much all I got for this week. If you like this, give it a thumbs up, comment if you have any questions about SD cards or maybe you have some information I don't know about. I just learned about the 4 gig limit recently. I've been doing video for 20 years so I would love to hear those and just thanks so much for watching. I'll see you in the next one.
