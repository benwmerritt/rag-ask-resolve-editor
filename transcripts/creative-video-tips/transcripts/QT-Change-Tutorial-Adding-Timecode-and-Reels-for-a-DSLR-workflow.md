Hey, it's Chadwick again. I want to do a quick rundown on how I use QT change to add important metadata to DSLR media Or anything that doesn't have timecode and reels associated with it prior to importing for use in an offline online project Either in Final Cut, Avid, anything. So here's how it works Download the app It's pretty basic looking interface, but it's super powerful and does Two things that I don't think anything else out there on the market that I've seen does So So first here's the problem case down here. We've got some footage from like a 5d mark 3. Okay 5d mark 3. It's great. Everyone uses it on everything One of the things that they praise about it is that it has timecode timecode It's great. We need it and you can see right here. We have actual real timecode on the footage What it doesn't have though is a real It's kind of silly that they give you timecode not real. I don't know why that is But we need real information or tape as Avid refers to it when we want to make an EDL If we ever want to be able to relink to footage for finishing outside a house, which we do on most of projects so 5d3s are missing reels, but they have timecode and let's go to like an older camera. Let's say a 70. Okay This is also indicative like a 5d mark 3 and and many other cameras prior to the 5d mark 3 So 5d mark 2 pardon me. So if we hit info on this one, it's even worse. So under logging we see there's no real here But there's actually no timecode What we have is just media start media end that's always gonna begin at zero and end however long the clip was This is no good either. It's not it's not actual timecode. So what we want to do is use this tool over here called Qt change This will add that metadata for us before we begin editing before we transcode before anything So here's how it works so we're showing you the problem First thing you need to know make a make sure you're working from a copy of your media files As always and also make sure you're not working from a network storage Attached like a NAS or as a sand when you're doing this some reason they warn against that. So I'll just go with them on that To bring Stuff into here the first thing you want to make sure with Qt change that sort of got me at first is under setup Make sure you change this to 23976 before you bring anything in or do anything If you leave it at the what it set when you begin it's one of these NTSC settings I'll totally mess up your footage and you don't want to do that. So, you know, if you're working at 24 like I am Excuse me 23976 Check that first Drag your footage in to this bin this open area. I guess it's called a bin You can see it scans real quickly and the footage is there We want to make sure in Qt change that we always leave this use THM XF thing So basically what that's doing is making sure we're using the time of day timecode From either the THM file which on a 70 sits right next to it. So keep those are good to use Or on a 5D mark 3. It's actually embedded within the quick time. So those are good So 5D mark 3 workflow what we want to do is just click the alter existing real name checkbox I always keep erase in case someone somehow there was something on there. And so we're consistent and I always want to use the clip name as the What we're setting the real Tip so check that box and then click update it's blinking at me and boom So we can see here before there was no real and then this little carrot and it says this is what our new real information will be This is what our starting timecode was and this is it's gonna retain that So now it's as simple as clicking do it and then it's gonna say are you sure you might really jack up stuff for people if you do this That's why we do this at the beginning of the workflow before anyone's edited or transcoded we say yes And you can see very quickly it just went through those four clips and it added a real to all of them These are h.264 files. I wouldn't edit with them but in order to maintain Consistency through the workflow. It's good to have this information on all the clips you can see We have a real now and that real matches the file name just good keeps it unique And it's also only eight characters, which is kind of an ideal Number for whenever you create edls. So There we go Great, that's 5d3 Okay now for 7d footage what we will do is drag the thm and the mov clips in there Okay scan zone find zone and All we need to do is click alter existing real name and We have previously found the The thm files so we've got time of day timecode Click do it We're gonna alter 10 quick time files. Are you sure you can do this click yes And you can see it goes through it's done. We can double check to make sure that these actually have timecode You look in quick time. We have also and we have quick timecode here. You can tell Hit command J. We also have a timecode track here. That's visible or And if you want to jump over to final cut You see we now have a real that matches the source file name And we have legit timecode starting here versus hour 21. So That's about it Qt change is sweet. There's other stuff out there, but it doesn't a lot of a lot of them out there will Ignore reels, but really those real names. This tape ID is a really important to have in your source files I know you can add them and final cut you can add them in avid, but at that point you're adding them to Dailies and not the source files. You're gonna be going back to for finishing and resolve or A flame or smoke or something. So you really need to have that from the source files on so hopefully this is helpful So check out my next video on creating dailies with resolve 10
