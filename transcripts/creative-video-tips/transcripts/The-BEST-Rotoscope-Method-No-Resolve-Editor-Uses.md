So all you have to do is track the shot, set the tracker operation to match move, merge bg only, draw polygon shape, and then change the tracker to fg only to make the tracker do all the hard work. Here's the result of a machine-learned magic mask cutout, and then here's the stabilized tracking-assisted rotoscope result using technology from 1997. This is so much cleaner. Chapter is a mark for you, and the tutorial footage is up on creativevideotips.com slash the cutting club if you want to follow along. So download the clip and let me teach you how to rotoscope a pixel perfect mask on a stabilized plate even in the free version of DaVinci Resolve Fusion. Oh and towards the end, I'll show you how you can access the Fusion mask directly in the color page as well. So the shot we're going to stabilize in rotoscope today is just a rectangular sign. Yeah this could be done in the color page easily, but the techniques I'm going to show you, you can use this on much more difficult shots that you'll probably encounter in the real world. Let's get to the Fusion page. I'm going to click the Fusion button or you get hit shift 5, you get there, and I'm going to change the layout like I always do. I don't like this left-right view. I like to go top-down, fills up my viewer space a lot nicer on my monitor. So I'm going to go to workspace, layout presets, fusion presets, mid-flow vertical. With this, I just choose the viewer that I want to see. I just want to see the bottom one. So I click this button right over here, this rectangle button, and then I do some node organization management over on the right. Things have sort of fallen off. If you use the middle mouse button, you can sort of pan around in your image and then control or command mouse wheel lets you zoom. So I'm putting my media out at the bottom, my media in one at the top, and I'll work from this top down. I also want to see the thumbnails. It's kind of a nice thing to see us wall right click over here and I'll say force tile pictures. And as I load this into the viewer by just clicking and dragging and releasing, you'll see the state of what node you're looking at up top there. Now you can see a thumbnail preview update, which is really nice. So let's get to tracking this thing with media in one selected. That means there's an orange box around it. If you take a look over here, you'll just type in shift space on the keyboard, shift space, and that pulls up your select tool window. I'm going to choose t r a for tracker. That's just your standard tracker tool hit return, or you can click the i button if you want to use the mouse. It adds it right in the flow right after. So the footage goes directly into the background of the tracker. Now in resolve 19, the default tracker is called IntelliTrack. So if I zoom over here IntelliTrack, it uses some sort of machine learning AI sort of thing. I don't know how to control it. I don't always know what the results are going to be. So I'm going to instead use over in the inspector, you'll see there's a typical like standard old point tracker. Click that and it gives us a different sort of pattern box over here. This is the old one. That's what I want to teach on because it's also available in the free version of resolve. So the other thing to know about this tracker, if you just want a piece of history, this is the same technology used in the 80s for missile guidance systems, believe it or not, that's what it was first used for before visual effects. Now to get rid of the IntelliTrack, I'm just coming over here hitting the delete button and now that's gone. Now the way trackers work is it's basically going to look at one pattern area and try to match that up to other frames. So over time it's going to try to follow that for you and it can do it at a sub pixel level based off of contrast. So what I need to do is find a high contrast area on this sign if I want to stabilize the sign, which is our goal in this first step, the most important step. And so what I'm going to do is move this tracking point to the upper left corner of the sign from one of my tracking points. And the way you move these is if I zoom in here, the upper left section of the area has a little dot, you click on that and that's how you actually move the tracking points in resolve fusion for the non-intellect track version. So I'm going to move that up here to the little corner. I'm going to zoom in and actually I can shrink this box down so that it's looking at even a tinier section of it. Basically the middle box is what it's looking at the pattern and then the outer box is what it's searching for if it were to lose that pattern between frames. The most important thing to know about is this tracker. It works off of different channels that you can assign. And so that means right now we're looking at the color channel if you look up here at the top of the viewer, but you could also look at the red channel and see how much contrast does that have. You could hit B to see the blue channel. The red channel has a lot of contrast. So another way rather than clicking through and looking at the channels up here is in the tracker tool itself. If I load the tracker into the window and I'm going to get it in there by just clicking down holding and dragging it across and releasing it in this window. Now I will point out once you cross this line it looks like you've lost it, but you haven't. As soon as you release you should see up at the top here the state of the flow, the state of the node that you're looking at right up top there. So over here in the right if I open my flashlight you can see point two. It's giving us a little preview of what the channel is looking at to do the tracking. And by default it's choosing the luminance channel. It's looking at the brightness not a specific red, green, or blue channel. And I can change that. I can control it. So for instance if I take a look at what the red channel looks like it actually has more contrast like we looked at before than just even the luminance channel does. So I might use that. There's also an automatic mode over here which might give good results, but I'll just try to choose the red channel. We'll see what that does. Now to start the tracking is just right up here at the top. We have track left, track right, we'll just hit track right, and we'll see the thing move along. Now if you don't see it move along it means your tracker is not loaded into the window. And you can check to see how good the track was down here as well with this little flip book preview. So in the inspector this is one way that you can check it. If you just go frame by frame. In fact you can even if you wanted to use these frame by frame you know buttons to sort of scan through to see if there's any problem. You know this had rolling shutter so maybe there was a frame or two that was bad. Let's just pretend that this was perfect. I have another tutorial about correcting tracking data with a guy walking through a poll that I will link up right now to get to that if you want to learn how to modify and fix tracking point tracker data. Now to get another point on here so we can stabilize this even better than it'll be able to. Let's go back to our first frame which is the first frame we started tracking from. Add another point in the list and once we add a new point it's going to drop it somewhere on our screen. It's down here in the lower right. I'm going to drag and move this to the lower right of the sign and kind of do the same thing I did before. I'll make this a little bit smaller. I might tell it to track just the red channel only and here's a key important thing to pay attention to. If I hit track right now it's going to retract anything in the list that has a check box. So if I don't want to retract this first point that I already did just click the check box to deselect it and now it'll just be tracking point three as I push the four button and just let that sort of run and rip right on through. Now that we have it tracked what are we going to do? We're going to stabilize using this tracking data. So I'm going to enable my original point and you can actually if you go to this state it makes it active but not editable. I'll just turn it to the check box so you can see the patterns there on the screen for both of those. We'll assume that the tracking held perfectly fine. If it didn't again you can go in here and manually move this this little point here or delete it. You can use gradient extrapolation. Again check out that other tutorial for that. I'll zoom this window to fit. Command F, control F will do that on a windows machine. It's not Z. If you hit Z hit C to go back to color but from this point on we need to stabilize this. So we've got tracking data but we haven't stabilized it yet and rotoscoping works best when you look at a stabilized image. So we go to operation operation instead of being none. We'll change to match move and the thing you want to choose is merge set to BG only. With merge up here set to BG only that's your settings. What that's doing is it's stabilizing everything off of a specific reference frame. Well what reference frame is it choosing and how can you change that? How do you choose what that reference frame is? Well the default is underneath the match move settings down here for reference and it's set to the start frame as the default. So that means it's going to keep this thing stabilized based off of the reference frame, based off of the data between those two points which means that frame zero you'll notice the frame is full. Like if I turn my transparency here so you can see the checker underlay it's moving computer slowing down a little. It's moving everything around from that first frame so it's going to make it easy to draw my polygon shape to do the rotoscoping. Now there's also reference frame instead of start frame which is your first frame you have end frame. So what that means is at the very end frame now this one is locked off. So if this is a better frame for you to draw your shape on you would choose reference frame set to end instead of reference frame to start. And then you have one other choice here and this one is kind of confusing and what this other one says is it says um reference well there's two others one that's called start and end is for stabilization in terms of like getting less jitter in the camera not for like locking it off which is what we're trying to do. The other one I want to point out is the one called reference select time. What select time means in here is the frame you started tracking on is actually the select time and you can't do this after the fact you can't choose a new select time so what this means is if for some reason you need to draw your polygon shape on a frame that's not the first frame or the last frame of your sequence you need to initiate your tracking on a the the frame that you're going to draw your polygon on and that would be set to reference select time. Now there's a tool called tracker plus that lets you change this later on it's in reactor. Log that away in your head in case you want it but for now we're just going to leave our reference set to start frame and everything is locked off. Alright so step two is going to be to draw our shapes and we have two main shape drawing tools here in Fusion. One's the polygon and one's the B-spline. I'm choosing polygon today because this is hard has hard edges. B-splines are great for organic things that have natural curves so think like humans fingers I get wrote a lot but I'm going to choose polygon shift space that pulls up our tool figure again start tapping ply uh ply got polygon hit return and when I draw polygons I like to not have them attached to anything this is uh so that you can see what you're working on when you're working on it but here's a here's another key node based thing to think about when you're working over here you can look at a node but actually work on another node meaning I have tracker one loaded into the viewer over here but I'm actually going to work on polygon so you can see I have the orange box selected on the polygon but tracker one is the one that's loaded what that means is I'm looking at the tracker through our match move BG only our stabilized version but I can still draw if I select polygon I get this crosshair with my cursor so I'm going to draw a rectangle around here and the important thing is that I draw it on my reference frame for our match move which is our start frame frame zero so I'm on frame zero you can see that down here I'm going to start drawing and as I zoom in you can see the power of Fusion is I can click and I can get precise I can go in really close and get little notches that would be harder to do in the color page right so if I just click I'll drag down there to that corner go over here to this corner real quick maybe I just go to here and here and then if I want to close it up we can either get close to the end here it makes a little circle o to close it or the shortcut to make sure you know you're closing the shape shift o we'll close up a polygon and now we have a shape there and if I want to play this throughout you'll see it mostly sticks as I go through this is frame 79 the last frame those corners stick nice the others don't because there is perspective to it now this is this will work with things better if there's not a big perspective change like there was in this but we can fix this easily in the next step by doing some very simple animation now before I even get to that point I want to show you if you need to draw a more complex shape one thing I would typically do is still on this reference frame just make sure your simple shapes overlap and you can use a there's a multi-poly tool but I just like to use multiple polygon shapes so what I would do is just shift space POLY there's another polygon and let's say we needed to get the bottom of this shape as well just make sure there's overlap so I'm going to come start a little bit higher draw this out I'm just clicking if you just click it makes a hard point and if you click and drag it makes a soft point and if you ever need to change between those two okay that closed it up you can hit shift s makes it smooth or shift L will make it linear again if you need a hard point so we can see the result of this shape looks like this the result of that shape looks like that you can add these together by just dragging one mask to the other mask and this is the way to sort of build things up with overlap and the other thing that nobody told me for a long time if you use shapes like this and you do animation with them it's really important on the polygon when when they're connected you have a paint mode set to merge you need to change this to maximum if you use the settings motion blur tabs so you don't get any weirdness right if you leave this set to merge and you turn motion blur on on the mask themselves you're going to have issues but we're going to keep this tutorial simple today not do multiple shapes we'll just get rid of that one and move on to the next step animate edges we're talking about key framing here but the thing about rotoscoping is you want the least number of keyframes just like you want the simplest shapes so let's take a look here at our tracker tool again we're going to pick and flick to load that into our viewer but I will click on our polygon and the moment you draw a polygon it automatically sets a keyframe on the frame that you draw you can see over here on the inspector section there's a little keyframe there it indicates that it's ready to start rotoscoping which means if you go to a different frame and move a point like I go to the last frame here 79 it will automatically do the interpolation between those points of the different keyframes in time it's easier to show that than to talk about it so what I'll do is I'm going to select this lower left point that is off now at the end frame and a couple ways to do that one is to lasso select so there's a drag and select that's nice if you're selecting lots of points but if you're just selecting one another thing you can do is hold down the option or alt key and it'll grab whatever is close whatever point is closest to your cursor so I don't have to go in here and like you know be super super precise on getting that point which I know can be really tedious so instead what you do is you just make sure your cursor is closer to this point than this point up here hold option and it will pull that along while I'm holding down option on the keyboard so I can reposition this point so that I'm really not concerned about the point so much but this edge lines up with this with where I need things to be so I'll go up here and fix this top right one as well now I might still have that one selected there so it's important to deselect first just click anywhere and it deselects that other point zoom in here hold option without even having to get close to that point and I can move this into pixel level precision in fact if I wanted it even more precise I can zoom in further and use the arrow keys on the keyboard so the way that would work is just you know up down left right we'll move that one pixel at a time and you can use like command control and do like quarter level pixels and get really really really precise so now we only have set two new points on one new keyframe for that shape and you can see it is really sticking much much nicer without having to really deal with all these big bobbles and shakes and stuff but I won't I will I do want to kind of go through here and and do a little bit in between so the idea is divide and conquer so divide and conquer means we'll do the furthest extremities and then we'll kind of go in the middle and fix things in the middle and then we'll go to the middle of that and fix things there so I'll go somewhere in the middle maybe frame 40 see if things are sort of off they are a little bit right here so I'll just option drag that back into place see if the other corner is still good since I've got a keyframe set here move that up and you can see down here at the bottom of my timeline that white tick indicates I have a keyframe set there that was a manually placed keyframe but because we're using tracking data we don't have to set nearly as many keyframes because we're combining two sets of data together tracking data and our manual rotoscoping data right so there you can see on our stabilized version of the plate meaning it was said to match move bg only we have our shape moving along with it just fine with minimal keyframe so that's minimal jitter now to actually match move this shape if I load the polygon in here you know it's it's moving a little bit with some of the keyframes that I'd set but it's not moving with the actual shot so the way we do that is let's look at the tracker again we'll take the polygon and plug this into the tracker and when you do that it's going to go into the mask channel right away that's not what you want see this blue mask channel or the mask effect we're going to undo that and we actually want this to go into the foreground of the tracker itself so the green input it's normally where you might think of putting a screen replacement or putting a mask there instead so I'm taking the green input of the foreground input of the tracker taking the output of the polygon and when I do this still nothing has really happened yet because we want to change our operation to look at the not the background only this time I want to look at the foreground over the background and when I look at the foreground over the background you can actually see the effects we've got this white block which is going to be our alpha channel or our mask our rotomat that we can use for anything we need to cut that thing out now if you want to perfect things a little bit at this state and not at the stabilized plate you can also take a look at this and say the apply mode instead of being normal you could set this to something like overlay or something and you might be able to sort of you know perfect your edges or something but in our case today instead of doing that I'm just going to change this to foreground only and the thing about things that moves make things move so this tracker is really the main thing that's making this mask move is they have a motion blur switch here in fusion so to get that realistic blur that would have happened in real life the settings tab um motion blur checkbox turn that on and you should be getting motion blur if you don't see it right click down here make sure your motion blur check is is enabled and you should see a difference between motion blur on and off just a little bit of any aliasing that makes it blend more realistically now if you're doing all your motion mostly with the polygons again remember you want to make sure if you have multiple polygons to use the maximum paint mode so that you don't get weirdness happening with multi polygons concatenating together that was a big word okay to make use of this mask and actually apply it well let's take a look what we have if we go to the edit page right now we could just have this alpha channel that's just hanging out there you could use this with inspector properties and use alpha composite layers in here if you wanted to but in fusion there's a mat control tool that's really cool and handy so you can sort of build stuff in here and layer things as you need to i'm going to show you how that works by just clicking anywhere in the flow shift space mat control and with the mat control what's interesting and this is another great thing about nodes is you can take multiple outputs from the same piece of footage and then you're not using your computer like crazy if you just did a copy and paste of the node like you'd think in like an after effects layer based workflow so i'm taking multiple outputs i'm taking a branch of media in one and throwing that into the background of mat control and the output of the tracker i want to go into the foreground of the mat control so the green foreground is what i want to be taking to put in there right which is this white box now if i take a look at mat control drag it up into the viewer over here we're looking at mat control nothing happens because the defaults for the mat control is to combine nothing but i want to combine this green foreground alpha so i'm going to say combine combine alpha and that will actually take this alpha channel put it together with the original footage so we can cut this out and have like a patch like a separate cut out you cut with scissors out and stick it on top and glue this on top of a piece of paper right but there is a weird thing that's happening right here if you take a look these little checker board things that are going on that means it's unpre multiplied it means it hasn't done the math necessary to clear the transparency out so you just hit this button over here called post multiply image and then that will sort of cut it out so you've got combine alpha post multiply image now you have this patch that could be just sitting nice separately now sorry i went to the edit page too soon there the reason you don't see that is because media outlets connected to the tracker if i connect the mat control out to media out go to edit page now you can see how you have this patch here you could see if you don't want to do any more infusion you don't have to you could lift this on a layer above put text in between put the original footage without the effect underneath you get the idea but if you want to go a little further infusion today with me i'll show you how you can merge other copies of the original footage underneath in here and then we'll go to the color page we're getting there right so the other way we could use this would be let's say we wanted to do just uh let's make a black and white version of the background so again i'm just clicking anywhere in the flow over here shift space bc for brightness contrast return take another copy we'll branch again off the original footage let's load our brightness contrast into the viewer so we can see it and the brightness contrast tool has a saturation control so let's just bring that down we've made a black and white image of the full image and now what if i wanted to just take the patch of it the color part and stick that back on top well this is we've separated everything out right so we're splitting the image apart we need to put it back together we put things back together with a merge tool so a shortcut to getting to a merge tool here infusion which is really handy i'm going to disconnect our current media out if you take what you want on top the output of what you want on top connect it to the output of what you want on the bottom and it makes a nerd merge let me show you how this works so the output of the mac control which is this little dot here so it's always the rectangle that's gray to the output of the brightness contrast i release it makes a merge the green is our foreground yellow is our background if i look at the results we sort of glued those back together one was unaffected cut out and then the other one was a color corrected version yes i know you can use mask and effect inputs on this to separate it but that's not the point of this the point is i want to show you how you can separate a patch so you can insert anything you need to in between it or isolate different pieces of footage and combine them to make a composite here infusion now to get this back to the edit page it's simple you just go straight to media out and you can see the results here on the edit page but what if i want to work on just the color for this in the color page well that's where a new media out comes into play so under fusion what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead at this point you can get an idea what the flow looks like here i'm going to delete this brightness contrast the mac control the merge because what i want to do is i want to have the original footage media in one going straight to media out one which means it's unaffected which means if i go to the color page i still have the full image to work on but i want to get access to the alpha channel we just made you know the map so from the fusion page i click anywhere in the flow and i shift space i say media out that gives me another media out this media out has a special index up here in the upper right that's index one versus the media out one is index zero okay so the importance of these is when we go to the color page now we do have a media out two i don't have anything plugged in yet that's why it's thrown this morning at me but if i right click in over here and i say add source in the flow for the color page so add source this gives me a new media source which is the media out to from the fusion page so check this out on fusion if i take the output of the tracker which is just the alpha mat right it's just this black and white gray scaled mat going straight to the media out we don't even have to use a bitmap or nothing right go straight to the color page if i want to make a drastic color change to this image here maybe i'll use the hue change the image color and then i want to go into the mask input from that second source i made there we go and you can even see the mat down here in the key if you want to flop it here you can with invert you have so much control with using mats that are created first tracked in fusion and then later you do the polygon second so it's kind of a reverse workflow from if you use the color page you usually draw the shape and then you track the shape here in fusion if you want to you can stabilize the footage draw the polygon on it on the stabilized version and then put the motion back in by changing your tracker set to operation match move fg only welcome if you're new here i really appreciate you i'm childwick and because there's so much more to learn i'll see you in the next video
