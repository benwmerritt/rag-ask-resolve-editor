If you're a filmmaker that stares at screens all day or all night, you know how tough those screens can be on your eyes. I need all the help that I can get to care for my eyes since looking at a computer monitor is half of my job as a video editor. So BenQ is the company that makes fantastic computer monitors. They sent over this super fancy monitor light free of charge to try out and it's really been an eye-opening ergonomic shift that I wanted to share with you today. The BenQ ScreenBar Plus is a computer monitor mounted LED light. It came in a slick, apple-esque quality box with just three parts to hook up, the light, the control dial, and the patented monitor clip. The clip that BenQ created is by far the best I've seen for this type of light. It's weighted just right and it fits on any flat monitor as well as my curved iMac display. They're rubber pads so it doesn't shift or scratch anything and leaves enough room for the FaceTime webcam. The monitor light and adjustment dial, they power up with a single USB cable that I plug into my USB hub and it just needs 5 volts just like charging your phone. Once it's plugged in, tap the dial to turn it on and the light emits an asymmetric light pattern, which that's some fancy voodoo science for explaining why the light doesn't put any glare or any reflections on my display. I don't get it but I like it especially when I'm color grading over in DaVinci Resolve. Now instead of needing to reach to the top of your monitor to change the brightness or color temperature, that's how warm or cool the light is, the plus model of the Screen Bar Monitor light, it uses a little puck dial which is oddly satisfying to adjust. The button on the right will toggle the brightness or color temperature which ranges from 2700 to 6500 degrees Kelvin and the button on the left performs an automatic adjustment based on the ambient light in the room. Why use it? Well, like you, I want to edit the best videos that I can and because uneven and poor light quality can tie your eyes out, this new monitor light has given my eyeballs a little break so as a result I can be more productive and craft better stories. That's the hope anyways. A couple of other things that have come from using the Screen Bar Plus is that it lights up my DaVinci Resolve speed editor and keyboard. The light doesn't just look fantastic in the B-roll but it also helps me find the right shortcut key to press when it's one that I don't use all the time. And of course it saves desk space from not needing a desk lamp which therefore gives you more room to pile up other creative tools all over the place. Would I buy it? Suppose I hadn't seen or used it in person? No, I wouldn't have bought it. It's a premium desk lamp at around 130 or so dollars in the US and that of course can fluctuate but that's a lot of money for a desk lamp. So it's nothing that would have even been on my radar as something that I needed to help me edit better videos. But now that I've actually had the pleasure of actually using it for a while I can't work without it. It's just one of those things that you didn't know you needed until you used it and now it's like where have you been all my life? Why don't companies just build these into computer monitors? I don't know. So in other words yes as odd as that sounds mainly because I can be very cheap on certain things. I'd buy this because it makes the hours that I spend at the computer that much more pleasant. The monitor clamp, the way it attaches to your screen and the little desk adjustment puck dial make this specific model stand out from the cheaper knockoffs and also the light it's rated for years. So you buy once, you cry once.
