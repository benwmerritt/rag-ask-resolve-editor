Now my personal but completely objective opinion is that Black Magic Designs DaVinci Resolve 19 is the most important tool for you to know and use for post-production in 2024. If you're new here, you're my new best friend. Welcome. My name's Chadwick. I'm a 42 year old New York based finishing editor. See, losing my hair, not lying. And I'm also a certified DaVinci Resolve master trainer with over 20 years of consecutive daily professional video editing experience for national broadcast commercials and churches. So the only reason I tell you that today is because I'm really obsessed with all the little tiny small like little details, the perfection stuff. That's the commercial side of me coming out. But more importantly, this channel is here to help you make a difference using Resolve and anything that you feel called to create. That's my church side. So in no particular order here are my favorite little things that I love and are brand new in DaVinci Resolve 19. Restore deleted timelines. This one is huge personally for me because just yesterday as the software was released, I actually was trying to clean things up because I like things tidy. And I had a timeline selected that I didn't mean to hit delete. And it's gone with version 19 right now. You can go to this three dot menu and restore old timelines. This is going to be a huge lifesaver. This is so small, but it's so important. The number pad timecode entry. What this does is it lets you navigate the timeline faster with the keyboard. You hit the plus and minus and you can jump up and down in time. You can also nudge and move all your clips and trim them with that as well. Deliver page optimize loudness. Now this is a new checkbox that's on the deliver page. And it's different than the normalize that was added not all that long ago. This one actually applies compression and dynamics to really make a difference to the loudness over the course of your video, which is a great way if you're going to upload to YouTube to kind of get a consistency without having to do a lot of extra mixing work. You can now disable video layers and a drop down in the deliver page. Why do you think this is important? And why do I love this so much? Well, a lot of times I need to create generics, which are like a text list version of a video. And before what I would do is I would actually create a new version of it or would have to go back to the edit page and disable the track. Now I can just stay in the deliver page, stay in that sort of zone and that mindset, make an option that is always set for generics, which would be disabling whatever video layers I had, you know, titles on and that sort of stuff, add it to the render queue, and then I'm done. You can tab marker clips in the media pool to rename them. This is actually a new feature and it's a really small thing, but it is something that we will use all the time now. If you are an assistant editor, you're used to going in and renaming any sort of fields and, you know, you can use the tab key to go from one field to the next, but the marker clips, the clip names, marker clip names have always been skipped over. So now if there's a marker set, you can go and rename him hitting tab, rename, tab, rename, and you can just keep your hands on the keyboard, which is going to make you much faster and you're going to be able to get through your job much, much easier. This is probably more than a little thing, but the clip inspector over in the file tab now is the ability to change your audio channel configuration. You can also mute certain channels if you need to, and it really just keeps you from having to deal with open up the clip attributes anytime you want to change which mic you're listening to on the timeline. I love this, I'm going to be using it a lot. Multi-poly. This is just like Nuke. It is so welcome to have infusion. It'll keep me from having to do all my roto shapes and put them into a single group. It's basically every shape is just a layer, just like multi-merge they came out a year ago. I'm going to use it all the time. I want to give you one little quick tip here whenever you're doing roto shapes infusion, and that is the fact about dealing with motion blur and overlapping shapes. This is something I haven't really heard much out there. I'm sure I'll do a tutorial on it, but it's all about using the maximum paint blending mode that's in there because if you've ever tried to roto, you know, like let's say an arm is moving, you need to have a shape here and a shape here. Well, in the overlap area, when you have motion blur with those two different things, you have weird things happen in the semi-transparent areas. So know about maximum paint blend mode, and now it's all in one single area for you to go and adjust that and make sure that that's working correctly. So multi-poly, it's going to be great. It's going to save up a lot of space on my node graph. Black magic cloud, media sync improvements. If you're an early adopter like me, you've seen some struggles with getting files in and out of black magic cloud. Well, now we have a few more tools at our disposal to sort of see what's going on. Oh, and one other thing I'm really looking forward to is if you use a black magic cloud store, those are the local boxes, right? There's three or four different models of that. You're going to be able to use those directly with black magic cloud storage instead of having to use Dropbox or Google Drive. Black magic cloud organizations. This one is huge. This means black magic is going big time into their cloud offering. They're going after Avid. They're going after Adobe. What they're offering very soon is the ability to use SSO. SSO is single sign on. It means like if your employer gives you an email to log into one service, use that same email and they control the gateway to all that. It helps with security so they can actually do work for specific companies that require that. It also allows them to give permissions for specific libraries. You can rent software for $30 a month and scale up and scale down as businesses change. I think it's a huge step and I can't wait to see it implemented and in practice even at the company that I work for. The EQ, the equalizer tool on the Fairlight page now has an analyzer built in, meaning when you're playing live, you can actually see all the frequencies as they're going. I wish this was there earlier, but I'm so glad it's there now. This is going to make it much easier to carve out areas of the sound that are problematic. Sidechain capable VST and AU plugin support. This one is huge. If you're still mixing in Pro Tools, which a lot of people are, now you have the ability to actually use Fairlight and use all those plugins that you love from waves or wherever you're getting them from that have the sidechain button on them. What this means is if you're unfamiliar, it means you can send your voice dialogue track to another track, maybe a music track and have that listen to it for things like specific VST plugins that do EQ. You might have a music track that you want to EQ out specific frequencies so that the voice sits in it much nicer. It's a more advanced way than just lowering the volume or compressing it. You have that ability. It's been missing and I'm so glad that it seems like it's here now. Now this one, borderline small and big for me. It's the OpenFX DaVinci Resolve renderer plugin for third-party applications. What it means is if you grade and resolve in the color page, you can export your still, your DRX still and load it into Nuke. You can load it into Flame. You can load it into Fusion Studio, which is my weapon of choice. You can actually use all the color information, including a lot of the plugins stuff that's in DaVinci Resolve Studio. That's wild to me that that is even functional, that that works. But it's now a thing and I'm really excited that they've made that available. The catch here is when you go to install the beta for Nuke DaVinci Resolve 19, there is an extra box. You need to make sure you check there for custom install so that you get that plugin loaded. And then you just put that resolve renderer plugin at the end of your schematic or your node tree and whatever software you're using and you're going to get an accurate look at what it's going to look like once it's rendered off the color page and resolve. Remote monitoring with IP address connections. Now I'm a tech nerd, so I particularly love this one. But what this means is you don't have to sign into Blackmagic Cloud to be able to use the remote monitoring. Remote monitoring came out. It's been for a couple years, but it got bigger last year. It means you can send your timeline or your color grading directly to a phone or an iPad that has the app or a computer that has Resolve Studio with an Ultra Studio connected to a display. It's a great way to avoid having to use another service. There's some great ones out there like Looper, but to get a live play out, to live stream and have a, you know, a collaborative experience. Now the person doesn't have to be logged into Blackmagic Cloud and imagine a creative that you asked to sign up for Blackmagic Cloud and doesn't want to. You don't have to anymore. You just enter the IP address of the host, which is your computer, and Bob's your uncle. Little thing, how about two times faster decodes with zip one compressed open EXR sequences? I mean, if you're like me and you're compositing a bunch and you realize that it's better to render sequences than it is to render movie files because you can distribute it or you can actually just render a part of a sequence, well, now we can work faster with zip one compressed open EXR better fusion view, let's support now there are CSTs that are in there. There's better open color IO, ASUS support. Now it's easier than ever to work in linear gamma in the fusion page like you should be without having to know a whole lot about other than clicking that special button right there and you'll get a good representation of your image in the fusion viewer. Text plus now has on screen controls just like the regular text tool on the edit page. Just make sure that you go to the fusion overlay mode, then you can right click and manipulate anything you see on screen, which is sometimes nicer than having to go over to the side and feel a little bit disconnected from your image. You can edit directly on the screen. The trim editor from the cut page is now on the edit page, which is where I work most of the time. It reminds me a lot of Abbott. We have a giant source and we have a giant record or timeline view and it just makes it easier to sort of see the transition between the cut. You can easily roll, ripple trim either side. I think it's going to be super super handy to just get a better bigger view on the screen. If you like this video, you might enjoy more of my little tips secrets that's in a series that should be on screen right now and because there's so much more to learn. I'll see you in the next video. Oh and warning, this is a beta software that's enough said.
