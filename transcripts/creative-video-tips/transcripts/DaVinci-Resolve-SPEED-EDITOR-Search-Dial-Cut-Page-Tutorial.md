I am so excited today. I've got the Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve Speed Editor. This thing is amazing. It's a new interface and it has this electronic search dial, the search wheel, and I'm going to show you all 16 ways how to use it in the next 10 minutes. Hey, welcome if you're new here. My name is Chadwick. This is Creative Video Tips where I help you create videos that make a difference and stand out. And if that's the kind of thing you're into, click subscribe right now so you don't miss my tip next week. Now let's just get into these tips and I will show you how this thing works. So one thing you need to know about the DaVinci Resolve Speed Editor is it does not come or at least mine didn't come with a USB-C cable and that's what you need to charge it or if you want to use it directly plugged in. The first thing we'll take a look at on the machine dial is you can use it to shuttle. Shuttles basically are JKL and what you'll do is just rotate slightly to the left to play backwards. It's more of a playback control than a finding or searching control. Next up we have jog on the search style. Jog is the most accurate way of going through footage. It's easy to find something down to the frame level with it. So it's great to work at the clip level with jog and it doesn't initiate like a playback and that's so shuttle involves like plain back footage. Jog does not and it's more finite. So you can see here I can as I move it and let go it stops whereas if I do shuttle and let go it's like I hit rewind on a tape deck or something. Okay so jog is the finite way of controlling like an individual clip. So then the third option over there is scroll. Now scroll is just like jog except that scroll is geared at a higher ratio so you can sift through larger amounts of material faster. Click scroll. Scroll is jog but like on steroids it will stop as soon as you let go which shuttle doesn't remember that's a playback thing but scroll lets you get from the beginning or end of a timeline much quicker. Okay my suggestion if you're not super precise use scroll if it's a long timeline and use jog if it's like a shorter clip. So next up with the search dial we have trim in and trim out. So I'm going to group these together because they're basically opposites of each other. You hold the button it selects the nearest edit and it quickly tucks up your timeline or expands it out further. The easiest way to trim something in the world it's amazing. So what trim in is basically going to choose you can see there's an edge right there of the the clip that's going in you can roll this right or left and it's just like butter. Same thing with the trim outside and what it's doing is it's using that smart indicator thing that's finding the next edit point and it's choosing that so you don't even have to like park right on a cut like I could be like right in between it and like if I just go to the left a little you'll see that smart indicator jump to the left if I go to the right it's jumping to the right so that's how it's making those choices. Now that I'm close enough to this cut I could say I want to trim the tail of it so the trim out and I want to make that shorter I just do that right there and I want to trim the other side of it I do that right there. It's pretty sweet. Trim in trim out also work in source they just work differently so if you tap source and what you're going to be doing is let's say let's mark in in and an out on something and then we click source again that basically gives us that zoomed in view if we choose trim in it's going to change our end point and trim out it changes our out point so that's kind of a bonus tip it's it's a function and trim in trim out they'll behave differently depending on if you're in source or timeline okay I'm going to hit escape which will give us our full and clear our markers so that gives us our full source tape again and I'm going to jump back to the timeline we'll get to our next function so next up we have roll if you hold roll it's going to find the nearest edit point go to left go to the right simple if you're unfamiliar with roll what roll is doing is it's taking away a frame from one shot and adding the exact same frame to the other so at the same time it happens super fast and that makes the whole timeline the same length from beginning to end. Slide is another type of edit you can do with the search style if you double tap roll basically what that's letting us do is shuffle that clip around in the timeline and it's kind of doing two rolls at the same time to the adjacent clips and if we have slide of course we have to have slip slips one of my favorite types of edit modes and that's basically going to let you change the inside contents of the shot without changing the edit points so if those are both lined up on music cues or a sound effect those get unaffected and we have slip source okay and we have slip destination so destination is going to be everything to the right of that smart indicator slip source is everything to the left of it I don't know why they didn't call it slip in and slip out so we've got slip source changing the inside contents slip destination slipping the inside contents of the shot after what if you want to move a clip to different part of the timeline well you just hold the split button which has move underneath it if you have the keyboard in front of you on the clip you want to move and then you just drag the dial and it kind of highlights it in orange and it tells you which way you're going with it and moves everything else where it needs to go around it it things get out of its way in other words you release it and it drops it wherever you want it to go so it's a great way to shuffle order of things you can also change the transition duration by holding the transition duration button and changing the search style so longer and short across the solves are super easy but guess what there's more not only can you change the duration of the transition you can also change the type of transition maybe you want some veneetian blinds or a clock wipe you can hold down that transition button and scroll that wheel until you find the craziest 1980s transition you might want to use that's not a fade or dissolve just don't put it on my video you can choose that great why don't we choose the heart transition and you can quickly have a heart or whatever you want it to be we could change it by holding it and maybe we want to go what's what's the barn door gonna do you know like try out all these transitions you can probably never use and probably never will but you could at least change between like a dissolve and a fade to black or something and then like I said before if you want to go and change and make that that transition less longer you hold transition duration and it's longer or shorter just with using the search style title font selection is another thing you can change with the search style you just hold down the title button and move that scroll wheel and you'll get to choose from all the fonts you have installed on your system if you do a double tap on the transition button which is also titled underneath so it's a double tap hold it now is letting me change the font with the search style by just rotating it here so it's a double tap hold and you can change your text font and just try a bunch of different stuff out and see what works good you know pretty cool you can even change the audio level with the search style hold the audio level button scroll left and right to increase and decrease volume so if you want to make clips really quiet really quick that's a great way to do it so now those drums are silent and if you want to make a monitor it's just whatever you're parked every hold it scroll right and we brought it up and there's noise again so that's pretty sweet audio level with the search style you can also change your marker color with the search dial so double tap hold and that brings up this wheel it's a wheel of fortune basically and let's say I want a green one it'll drop a green one let's go somewhere else later and this guy is going to get pink it's going to be a double tap hold and we wait until we get a pink one let's do a pink or pink one and just you know kind of fun way to drop colors on your timeline now the snap button is kind of cool underneath there are three horizontal lines and what this does you double tap and hold it while using the search style and you can change your viewer size so this kind of seamlessly it's kind of a buttery smooth experience to make your viewer larger and your timeline smaller vice versa so you double tap the snap button and scroll dial it has those three lines below it we can make this bigger and smaller by just scrolling this sweet machined wheel so that's underneath the snap button one of my favorite features the cut page has is close up what it does you tap it and it gives you a punched inversion so if you're working in a 1080 timeline with 4k material you can get like these virtual close-in shots which is awesome but maybe it doesn't put it in the right spot so this head is cut off and we want to fix that so you hold this close up button and you can change the y position the vertical position by just holding that down and we can get the singer's face back in the shot so when it makes the cut it goes and you can see it all of it in its glory so the close-up feature is cool because it actually uses the facial recognition stuff that's in the neural engine of the software but on some shots like this one in particular it's not finding faces it's I mean it'll find it on like an interview or something if it's a kind of a standard shot but having that ability to change that right on the fly is pretty freaking sweet now you're absolutely a search dial master with the speed editor in DaVinci Resolve 17 I hope you got something out of this video
