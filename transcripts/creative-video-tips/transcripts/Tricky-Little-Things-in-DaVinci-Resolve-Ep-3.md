DaVinci Resolve has a few odd things that are actually really powerful features like the database model for storing projects. Still, it takes some getting used to if you're coming from other editing software. And one of those things that is not obvious is that you can actually copy and paste from one project to another with dynamic project switching turned on. It's just a right click. And there's even a drop down menu on the edit page to quickly access the other open projects without going back to the project manager. So anyways, today I have more of those little things that I wish that I had known when I started working in Resolve a decade ago, and they're all clearly chapter marked for your convenience. Close Current Project. Let's say you've got a cat or a toddler around that likes to push buttons when you're not at your desk. So you want to close your current project you're working on, but still keep DaVinci Resolve open and running for when you sit back down after lunchtime, right? You go up to the file menu and you choose close project, right? Well, nothing like that is there. I wish it were there, but it's not. So the solution is just open up the project manager. You can do that with shift one or simply click the little house that's in the lower right corner. Once you're there, you right click on the current project and choose close. That easy. Mandatory middle mouse. Okay, what I'm talking about here is if you don't already have a mouse with a middle click, today is the day you should buy one. I've got affiliate links in the description. My favorite is the Logitech MX Master 3. Or if you have a trackpad on a laptop, you need to get the app called middle. It's literally called middle and it lets you use a foretap as a mouse click. Or if you're using a Wacom tablet like I am today, I have this bottom button right here assigned to middle mouse click and that works as well. Well, why is middle mouse so important? Here's three reasons. Number one, it's a really fast way to copy and paste a color grade from one clip to the next. Okay, what you do is you highlight the clip that you want to change and then you middle mouse click on the clip that had the correction on it. Right? It's really that simple. And the great thing is that you can do this in batches as well. So you could just shift select a bunch, middle mouse click the one that had the changes and then it's applied to all of them. Now the next one is to actually pan around the viewer after zooming. If you hold the middle mouse button down, like it's basically like the hand tool in Photoshop. Okay, you can use the scroll wheel to zoom in and move around that area, but you push down and hold on that middle mouse button and then you can move around. Now, if you want to get back to the full screen view or a fit to viewer, you just hit Z on the keyboard. Now a bonus tip here about using the scroll wheel on the mouse is on the color page, you can use this to blow up the scopes as well. The only difference here is in the scope window to zoom in. First, you're going to hold down option or alt on a PC while using the mouse wheel to move around. And then to see different areas, you smash that middle mouse button to sort of pan around. And to reset it, you have to do that through the menu option. I don't think you can do that with Z. So just know if it is zoomed into far and you just go out, go to the menu option. And then the third mandatory use for that middle mouse button is to close an open tapped timeline. Okay, middle mouse to close them, tab timelines or stacked timelines, they're turned on in this view menu. And a quick way to close one out is with the middle mouse click. Full screen audio only waveform view full screen or P on the keyboard for presentation view. It's a great way to see a full screen play out of your video. But I bet you didn't know that you can also blow up a full screen source view of audio only clips to see waveforms with P for presentation as well. I find this like super helpful sometimes to mark in and out with it being full screen like that if there's like a high noise floor, or maybe my eyes are just getting tired of looking at the small waveforms. Another small thing but important is the option under the three dot menu for viewing a zoomed or more commonly used full waveform of the clip that's loaded into that source side monitor. It gives you like a green overlay and that displays the playhead as well and you can park it to make it easier to find when a new lineup dialogue is going to start visually. And to help you find the next chapter marked adventure resolve tip that you didn't really realize you needed to know check out the playlist on screen right now. And because there's so much more to learn I'll see you in the next video. Thank you so much for watching.
