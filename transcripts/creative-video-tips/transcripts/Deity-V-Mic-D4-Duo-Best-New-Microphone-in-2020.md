Hey how's it going? I'm Chadwick. This is Creative Video Tips and today I want to talk about the D80 D4 Duo microphone that I just picked up. It's this guy right here and what is so cool about him is that there is a microphone on the front and there's a microphone on the back. So this microphone is meant to sit on top of a camera and you can capture sound from the person that's filming and you'll get sound of whoever's in front of you because there's two cardioid capsules. So I'm real excited to start using it. I'll probably do a full review on it if you're interested and one of the other sweet features of this microphone is it has an auxiliary input right on the mic. So you can plug a 3.5 millimeter lavalier mic into there, mic someone up maybe with a road wireless go or like an AVX Sennheiser system or something like that and you can make sure that they have you know a mic on them from far away but then you also have another safety track that's back on the camera. So that's pretty cool. The D4 Duo comes with two windscreens which are awesome for outside that wind protection and then it also has a right coat mount so that it won't have any of that camera jostling as you're moving it around. One of the other things I'll just mention here in closing is it has plug-in power so there's no battery required at all. So that means you plug it in, if you're recording you've got sound which is awesome. That's all I got for today.
