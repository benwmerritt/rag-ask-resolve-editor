Okay, something I'm super excited about, I just got it in the mail, is the Peak Design Everyday Messenger backpack from Trey Ratcliffe, or well from Peak Design. Trey Ratcliffe was pushing it, so. I like the Messenger bag that they had. But I'm more of a backpack person. So, I wanna give this a shot. I haven't gotten a new backpack in a couple years. So, let's see what's in here. So, it's sort of an unboxing, but it's really, I guess an unbagging. It comes in a bag. What we've got is the 20 liter backpack, the darker color one. So, looks like it's got backpack straps for your shoulders. Not really useful. We've got a bunch of stuff that I don't know how it works yet. Let's see. There's a buckle here. Oh, it's got like a magnet and a little clasp. It's hard to see, but kinda clasp on there. And, we got some, we got some foam bubbles. Ah, it's dead. And then, that's what we got in here. More foam. It's not foam, it's like all these bubbles of air. You know what, maybe I should save the rest of those for my kids to play with. Then, we've got a nice big inside to the bag. Feels kind of like, it's kind of a more of a rigid fabric. I'm guessing there must be like waterproofing in it. And then, looks pretty cool. Says peak design, everyday backpack, 20 liters. Just like I ordered. So, I got this on Kickstarter, and it just came yesterday. We got a little sticker. In case you guys like stickers, got a sticker in there. Yeah, it looks pretty cool. I think you can order, open it up from the side. So, you just go like that, boom. Then you have access to camera stuff. Bodies, lenses. Materials feel really good. Zipper's pretty heavy duty. A lot of padded stuff in here. Looks like good. I don't know what I'll put in there. Maybe an audio recorder, microphones, because I do more video stuff and photography. And then, looks like if you are left handed, you've got the other side as well. Which is cool. And this is just like a ski jacket. This is pretty cool, check this out. So, I think you can see up there. You can up zip it from the bottom up, to open it up. Or, you can take it from the top down. And still open her up, which is cool. And it looks like same kind of pocket on this side. Don't quote me, because I don't know. Might be a little different. So, if you're right handed or left handed, you can open it from either side, the way you wanna swing it over your back. What else do we have? Something in here, my hand goes in here. I don't know, maybe that's, not just straps or something in there. Let's flip it over. I think there's a spot for my laptop, through the top. Yep. So, I'm gonna use this to travel. I go on work related trips. Up top we've got, a little tiny sleeve up top here. Probably good for iPhones or passports, or well, maybe not passports, but something easy access to. And there's a big opening slot. That goes pretty far down. And then an even bigger, so there's two other slots. One would be perfect for my iPad mini. Maybe a full size iPad. And then my big 15 inch laptop should fit in that back part pretty well. So, they maximize these so that's space really good. Zippers are good, got a pretty wide handle here. Looks very hipster, not very much my style, but hey, gotta get cool one of these days. And then, let's see. There's a little clasp here, this is probably to tie it across your chest. So, yeah. Pretty cool, this is the same kind of straps I think they use on the camera straps, as they're like seat belts. So, pretty wide and comfortable, slick design. Let's see what this thing is inside of here. I need an instruction manual. We got these dookies. I might have to go on their website to figure out what this is. For, if any of you guys know, leave a comment. And maybe you can explain to me why I have these. Maybe it's, you know when you go backpacking, you put like a, you can roll up, you roll up like a sleeping pad or sleeping bag. Yeah, that's what it's for. Sleeping bag, photographers need sleeping bags. And hook it around down at the bottom here. Probably not. I don't know, we'll see. Tripod, that's the only thing I don't know. Where am I gonna put a tripod? I didn't even think about that one. Bet there's, okay. So, side pockets here. There's a bit of play, so I think he could probably fit a small tripod in the side. Ooh, one other thing that's cool. There are carry handles on the sides. So, lots of places to grab the bag. Both left and right have those. So, that's it. That's my unboxing or unbagging of the everyday, what is it, peak design, every day. Gotta get that word right. It's the peak design, everyday backpack, 20 liters, the dark color. I'm excited to use it. Gonna take it on some trips here in the next few weeks. See how it goes, I'll let you know. Bye.
