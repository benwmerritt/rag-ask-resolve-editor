In DaVinci Resolve, the only way to bypass your computer's GPU and see a frame accurate unaltered color signal out to a calibrated display is using an external Blackmagic Design UltraStudio monitor. But the cost-effective one, the popular UltraStudio 3G, it's 1080p. That's the one I use and have installed a bunch of. And we often work with timelines larger than 1080p tall, right? Especially those vertical social ones. So the question is, how can we work at resolutions like 1080 across by 1920 tall for things like TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, or YouTube Shorts and still see that full image all the way top to bottom on the nice calibrated display? Let me show you the tip that I just learned this year from a very kind Blackmagic engineer. Here in DaVinci Resolve 19, this is a standard 16x9 timeline and it's set to 1920x1080. You can always check that by clicking it over here and then look at the file tab, which is great and it works out of the box with the UltraStudio 3G. So that is selected up here under preferences, video IO, you can see I'm monitoring right now out the UltraStudio monitor 3G. It's a great little box, but it's 1080p only. So what happens to my picture when I make this vertical? Well, I'm going to make a duplicate of the 16x9 timeline up here by right clicking and saying duplicate timeline. And then on the duplicate timeline, I'll do something logical like come over here, select it, rename it to 9x16 timeline, which doesn't change the timeline resolution, but at least it lets me know. And to change the timeline resolution, I would right click on it, say timeline, timeline settings, and we have this use project settings down here. I'm going to uncheck that, which will also give you a new cog once we finish this here that lets you know that one's different from the defaults. And we have a handy button that says use vertical resolution. Now when I check this, pay attention to mismatch resolutions down here. It's going to not scale entire image to fit, but it's going to scale full frame with crop. There's no worry about like if you work with Premiere about how scaling works there versus here and getting the best quality. Premiere has set frame size and scale the frame size. This is going to give you the best quality regardless. But when I check this, yes, it makes a vertical video. But if I take a look at this over on my external display, it is actually cropping the image around right here at this line and it's cropping the bottom down here. And because what it's actually doing is it's cropping the 1080p pixels so that anything larger than that. And again, we set our timeline settings to 1080 by 1920. That extra gets cropped off. So what this workflow allows you to do is see all the pixels on the monitor and that's as easy as not going to the monitor setting like I would have thought you would do. You actually go to the output settings and you uncheck use timeline settings for output scaling. And we say that the output resolution is not going to be custom. It'll be 1920 by 1080. Click OK. And not a whole lot has changed here about the framing other than you got black bars. But over on my monitor over here, the calibrated monitor, now I can see all the pixels to the very top of the frame and the bottom. So this is how you would do this if you need to send it out to any sort of TV or even a streaming encoder so that people can see the full frame and you can make changes about where things are positioned in the frame over here. Maybe we need to, excuse me, not zoom it, but we move the position so we can see the swimmer over here or we want to get this boat centered. I have another video that talks all about how you can use Smart Reframe in the Ventures Off Studio that kind of does some of this repositioning automatically for you. Sometimes it's more trouble than it's worth, so just take that for a grain of salt. So now how do we get this rendered out so we're not looking at these black bars? Well on the deliver page, if you go straight to there to start to render stuff out like you normally would, it's going to look at that output scaling option for 1920 by 1080. All you really need to do is just be mindful to hit the use vertical resolution button and that'll flop that and it'll look wonky coming out of the box. So watch this, I'll hit test, go into my desktop, render queue, render all. It looks all stretched and wonky going out, but it'll get rid of those bars for you. So you'll have a 1080 at command-i by 1920 image on the way out without any of that extra cropping and you'll get the full quality of all the pixels. Now I have seen this go a little bit wonky from time to time by setting it in the deliver page to vertical, especially if I'm doing 4x5s and stuff too. It can be a little confusing, so you might at the end of when you have it approved then you're done looking at your display. Go back to your timeline in your media pool, go to timeline settings, the output tab over here, again it's output, not the monitor tab, don't be confused. And in this time just say use timeline settings for output scaling and that effectively gets rid of that cropping and then when you go to the deliver page it's automatically going to pull up that resolution to be 1080 by 1920. So that's two quick solutions to getting your vertical videos output at the vertical resolution but still being able to use your 1080 monitor and see all the top and bottom pixels. And I want to make sure you understand if you don't have an ultra studio 3G, not a big deal. If you have DaVinci Resolve Studio, the paid version, underneath the workspace you can go over here to video clean feed and set this to your other monitor, it has to be a second monitor and then that will display the image full frame without having to change any of those output timeline settings at all. I'm Chadwick, this has created video tips where I nerd out about all things DaVinci Resolve and because there's so much more to learn, I'll see you in the next video.
