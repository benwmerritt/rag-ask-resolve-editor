Hey guys, it's Chadwick. I want to show you a quick walkthrough of doing some trimming in Final Cut 10. It's a lot easier than people say it is and it's also pretty powerful. You can in fact do dynamic trimming and make cuts while you're playing back your footage. Very similar to Avid. First thing we want to do is get familiar with part of your keyboard and what we want to do is select an edit point. The keys that I used to do that are the semicolon and quotation keys. They're the ones right next to the return key. That will jump us from edit to edit point. So we have an edit point selected right here. Now we need to select a trim operation on it. Now we don't need to use the the T trim tool that you find off over under here. Instead, what I like to use is the keyboard as frequently as possible. So the keys you want to use here are going to be the the left bracket, the right bracket, and the backslash key. So these three keys right here are like the bread and butter what you need to be using for trimming. The one that it's on right now, the the backslash key is a roll. You're gonna be subtracting and adding frames depending which way you're going. You're not changing the overall duration of the timeline. The ripple keys like a left bracket is going to be adding and subtracting to the tail of that clip and kind of the same way the other one is going to be another ripple trim which is going to be adding or subtracting to the head of the next clip. The first thing we want to do is set up your preference for your play around selection. We do that up here under Final Cut Pro preferences and editing. I like to have mine set at three seconds before and three seconds after and that's what this means right here after wherever your playhead is parked. So what we're gonna do to make this work great is we've got the playhead parked right on the edit point. We have a three second pre and post roll and we activate that by hitting shift forward slash which is gonna be right underneath the return key just like this. So that's taking it back three seconds and playing three seconds after where my playhead was. Now the reason it's showing me a preview of the cut kind of like it would in Avid is because I had the playhead initially parked on the cut. So if I hit stop it'll jump me back to where the initial point was. Now the other thing we want to need to set up and make sure is on is under review playback just check to make sure a loop playback is on the shortcut for that is command L. Now that we have an edit point selected we have the range set to three seconds plus and minus on the playback range we should be good to go. The first thing I like to do is select the incoming clip and play around selection there and we'll see where it cuts out. It's a little bit early for my taste so let's let's see if we let it play a little longer and to make that edit change what all we're gonna be doing is using what they call the final cut calls the extend edit command and that would be shift X. So what I'm gonna do it's looping through again here is hit shift X and about the moment I think the edit should occur. So in this instance we're not actually gonna see the app point but you can kind of feel where it might need to be at. So I'll let it play through one more time here and then I'll be hitting shift X at the moment when I think the snowboarder should be cutting out there. So you can see it takes a second for it kind of stutters and then it continues playback. You can see he rides out a little bit smoother. Okay let's say what if I want to do a roll on this edit instead. That's no problem you would just select the backslash which indicates that you know you can see both sides are highlighted that means you're gonna be adding and subtracting frames from one shot to the other. You would do shift forward slash right underneath the return key and because we had chosen the backslash key for a roll whenever you hit shift X that's sort of the key to all this is shift X that's gonna be changing the edit point to that that moment in time and it doesn't change the duration of the clip. So let's say we want to change this so goes right there you see I'm just moved it back a little earlier. We're gonna that's adding frames to the skier and taking them away from the snowboarder. Now we see that there's probably a little bit too much pre-roll for the skier so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change the trim operation to a ripe bracket and what that's gonna allow me to do is take some of that fat off of the the head of the skier clip. So as soon as I get it to a point that I like it I'm gonna say there you can see right when it was playing back I could watch it and choose my edit point and that was probably a little bit too late. So that's sort of dynamic trimming but since I did that a little bit too late and maybe I just want to be a little bit more precise I can easily just go to the edit point and use the nudge left nudge right buttons that are at the bottom. Now these are the same position that you use in Avid or Final Cut 7. Just use the comma here and this is gonna let me throw some more frames and you see the sequences rippling out to the bottom of there. Let's say you wanted to do a lot you would just add shift as your modifier. You don't use the M key like in Avid but it's the same kind of idea just add the shift button and that lets you adjust either way. You can sort of see. Another thing that I kind of like is that you can actually hold the buttons down so you can hold down your comma button and it's a little stuttery right now because it's a screen capture but it's actually moving smoothly and you can sort of see the cut rollback. For those of you that want to try just doing simple cuts to take stuff out you can easily just find a clip and say hey I want to get rid of stuff between here and there you can just scrub with the skimmer and hit command B and that just makes a cut pretty basic but effective and then you can select ranges and delete like so. One other thing that's really kind of cool and useful I'll undo that is a concept of you doing top and tail editing just like you would do in Avid right here in Final Cut. So I'm gonna undo the blade splices that I made right there and to do top and tail editing you can do this while it's playing back as well but I find it useful to use the skimmer to kind of hover you know rough positioning of where you'd like stuff to begin and end. So for instance let's say hey I want this clip to be done at this point right here then I would just do option right bracket and then the same kind of thing going into the next clip. So you just click option left bracket for the end point that will quickly trim that off as well. Now you could easily instead of doing that I will undo that. Another thing that we could do that I've done been doing for years is simple I and then O and then delete and that will remove stuff like most of us have been using for years with with all editing applications just IO delete.
