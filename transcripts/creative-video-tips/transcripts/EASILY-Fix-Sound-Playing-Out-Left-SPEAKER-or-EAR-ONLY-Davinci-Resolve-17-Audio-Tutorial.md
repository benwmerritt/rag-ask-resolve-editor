I'm gonna guess you're here because you can't hear dialogue out of both speakers or maybe you only hear one person talking out of the left headphone and the other person is talking out the right side only. Well let's not waste any more time and center that sound up real quick. Now today I have two solutions for two similar but different issues so feel free to use a time stamp so you can get back to editing or watching more creative video tips tutorials. The first is if you have a single microphone that's pushed all the way to like the left side channel. Oh and just so we're on the same page anytime I say channel you could replace the word channel with the word speaker. Same thing. So here in the Ventures Off 17 I've got a one channel one microphone audio clip here on a timeline that is set to stereo. We know that because it says 2.0 right there. And I also want to prove that by opening up the mixer and we're going down to this 3.menu and we'll change this to meters. We'll play back a little bit of the timeline. But I do have the receiver set to split mode from the last time when I recorded two people. So right now everything is going to be going into the left channel. So we see you there on the meter. We heard everything on the left side if you have headphones on. That's our problem. Here's a quick solution that a lot of people don't talk about. If you go up to the Effects Library this section up here there is a Fairlight effect called Stereo Fixer. Just scroll down you'll find it's called Stereo Fixer. It's made to do to fix exactly what our problem is here. So the best way if you keep your tracks organized and all of that type of clip is if you drag it to the track header area this will apply to everything that's downstream that basically lives on that A1 track. So that's the way I prefer to do it. And there's a preset on here to do exactly what we want. We know our sound is left only. So you choose left only which is this button right here. You just click it and then you can play back your timeline. This is how we're going to fix that so that everything is hopefully right now it's by now it should be playing in both ears equally. So just like that you can see now we have both ears equally it's taken the left and applied it to the right and we didn't even have to apply anything to the clip we just did it on the track level. If things were on the right side only this that's what this button does right here. If you want to disable and hear what it was like before you could just uncheck that right there click back on your timeline. So this is a common scenario the road wireless code. Right what we want to fix that to microphone plugged in and that's really all there is to it. It's great if you just have a single microphone and you just need to center that out. The other thing I was going to point out is this is a good fix if things are on the timeline already but I kind of prefer to have things correctly set up before they even get to the timeline so that's what I'm about to show you next. So let's remove this effect and the way we can remove the fact it's not just hitting X right here. Choose the track header area over here and then go up to inspector and then effects that's where that effect is actually stored. You can hit the trash can button and it's gone. It's back to where we started to fix this and clip attributes you go to media pool and the other nice thing about doing it this way is you can sort of batch do this. So we have multiple clips here that have the same issue where we just have sound on that one channel. So I'm going to select them both kind of marquee drag them right click go down to clip attributes and then right here we basically we see we have audio one embedded channel one going into the left speaker and embedded channel two which has nothing on it's going into the right. Well we want to change this so that we're doing channel one into the left and the right and by just doing that simple step and clicking OK now these clips will play out both left and right side at the same time. Last time when I recorded two people. So just like that that would work out great. Now this does not like I said this does not affect if you do this in this spot it does not affect things on the timeline already so you would need to re-edit this back onto the timeline. You know you could drag that back down there. Set to split mode and that would fix it. You can also do this on the timeline to each clip by right clicking and saying you know doing the whole where is it clip attributes. It's funny they move clip attributes depending on where it's at and you could you could set this down here as well. The other thing I was going to point out is the proper quote unquote proper way of doing this is probably to set this to mono from the beginning. OK so I'm going to remove this from the timeline. We're going to change our track type down here from stereo to mono because we're going to be editing mono sound and we're going to choose our clips up here and clip attributes right click and say clip attributes and we're going to be adding a mono track click add and we're going to delete the stereo one and we know everything is on the embedded channel one of our video clip that's the left one click OK and now it should just be playing that one side because it's just me talking to the camera right now and then we can edit that down to our timeline we can drag we can use lots of shortcuts but this is kind of the preferred way especially once we get into lots of different channels of microphones and sound we have one microphone it's mono it's on the track and we can take a little lesson here and we don't want that we want it coming out both left and right so we get so those are kind of the three little quick ways of addressing one microphone here in DaVinci Resolve 17. Hey real quick time out because I want to say welcome if you're new here to create a video tips I'm Chadwick and this channel is here to help you create videos that make a difference and stand out. If you're into that and DaVinci Resolve click subscribe right down below it's totally free and maybe also hit that bell so you don't miss out on the new tip next week. Anyways I also want to say a huge thank you to the 5000 plus of you that recently joined this community your input and ideas have been so valuable to everyone on here and I'm extremely grateful for your support. OK now let's take a look at those times when you get two people talking out of completely different headphones this is going to happen a lot on the new microphones like the D80 V mic D4 Duo it has like a front and back microphone and also the Rode Wireless 2 kit you know this lavalier kit you're able to put two microphones on someone at once it's pretty awesome but you record this way so you have independent control of you know each microphone each person but first we need to center them up and this is how we do that. Real quick before I show you how to get independent microphone control if you take a look at one of these clips we can see here if we go to audio track there is obviously there is a different person on each of these channels up here right. Oh boy that's some gooey dough. Oh boy that's some gooey dough. Yeah it probably is. Alright so and my son there is on the other one a quick way if you've already edited it and it's on a stereo track you can use the effects library fairly it affects stereo fixer as shown you prior and you just want to choose this one right here mono and this would basically be the same as if you had chosen merged with the Rode Wireless Go it's basically saying each of those are going to come out but we lose that independent control. That's not that. Oh boy that's some gooey dough. But you can hear right there it did actually fix the problem of one being out one speaker one being out the other. Let's remove that okay we're just going to click X there we'll choose this inspector and effects trashcan okay so that's gone. The proper way to do this is actually before you edit them to the timeline you need to make them into mono channels mono tracks so we go to media pool to do that and you can batch them luckily. So we're going to move all this from the timeline command A and delete and we're going to set up our timeline with two mono channels to work with so we can edit them independently. We're going to change the track type here by right clicking saying change track type to mono and then we're going to add another track by right clicking saying add track mono and now we have two mono tracks that we can control separately so we can control levels effects all that completely separately. We just need our clips to be set to that dual mono setup and right now they're not. The fastest way to do this is to select them all in your bin command A right click and then clip attributes and then we're going to choose format set to mono under audio. So if this is on video go over here to audio choose mono and we're going to add two mono tracks click add and now we can get rid of the stereo and everything should be set up correctly so we have embedded channel one going to track one embedded channel two to track two that's the right speaker we're going to click okay select all of them and then we can just drag them down and then you have to use a shortcut today look at that we're just using mouse keeping it simple and now you can see each of these we're able to control completely independently and separately which is awesome because it's often times that you'll hear one person will be louder on a microphone than another and with these little three and a half millimeter inputs you can't control them you know on the device on the recording device usually so now we can control them here in post with using you know option clicking and changing our levels we can mute the one that's not in use which is a really good idea to do to to make things cleaner so let's take a listen let's open our mixer so you can see yes I saved one so there you can hear yes I saved one is on this if I wanted to make that louder you can option click to add keyframes and then just bump that up and even make that louder yes I saved one and then you kind of do the opposite if you were really to get into it on the other side you know option clicking and then bring down the other microphone so yes I saved one man this is making me want some chocolate chip cookies no doubt but here's another example you can see we've got he's talking right here I'm gonna show you what we use so that you can make some your own cookies at home so he's explaining but there's nothing going on on the other microphone it's still running you could just in this instance you could just take this down and mute it right that's all you even need to do so that this is all gonna sound much much cleaner because we're only using the active sound and then you could also EQ things too so because we've separated this out by tracks this is for a whole nother video but you could EQ track one and EQ track two separately all right now one mistake I want to make sure you avoid that I often see new editors make is when the production team shoots a boomed overhead microphone and they also put a lav on someone like for an interview you're really only meant to pick one of those usually the lavalier is meant to be the backup in this case make sure you import them both as mono channels and place them onto mono timeline tracks and just drop the level of the backup channel this way you don't hear it and it's still there and it's available if someone needs it for mixing you know you never know hey if you found this tutorial useful at all make sure to give it a like and let's keep picking up more DaVinci Resolve tutorials and tips with the playlist that I have on screen right over here and since there's so much more to learn I'm gonna see you in that next video
