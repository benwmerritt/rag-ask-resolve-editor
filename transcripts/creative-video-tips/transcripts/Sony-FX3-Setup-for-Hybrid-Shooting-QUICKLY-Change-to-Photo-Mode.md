I can't tell you how many times I've been asked to just get some photos real quick while I've been out on a video shoot. That camera there? It can do both, right? My answer's always been yes, but it hasn't always been fast or simple because you gotta redial in all your settings that you need to change, things like your shutter speed. Well, props to you for taking a deeper look at the FX3 because Sony has us in mind to shoot better hybrid photo video much faster, and today I'm gonna show you those settings that you need to set up. Enough talk, let's get into the menu system and let's set up your Sony FX3 for fast hybrid photo video shooting. Okay, first up hit that menu button and we're gonna go down to the shooting menu, the red one, and we're going down to number four shooting mode, and make sure that you're on exposure control type set to flexible exposure mode. If you click in on that, you've got also the PASM mode. We don't want that one. We want flexible exposure mode. And if you're ever curious what things do in the menus, there's this little hidden gem. If you hit the trash can button, that's gonna give you more information about any sort of setting that's in here. So that's a little good extra thing to know, but just make sure you're set to flexible exposure mode. Flexible exposure mode, let's use the buttons and dials as they come from the factory as they're labeled here on the camera, so I probably wouldn't change that. It's actually super cool. The way they work is if you tap, let's say the button three here where it says ISO, it's gonna lock that value in. So even if you move the dial, it's not gonna change accidentally. So if your hands are rummaging around on the camera, you don't have to worry about it. It's set. It's not gonna be changing. The other thing that they can do is they can go into auto mode for you if you hold it down. So just press and hold it. It'll quickly go to auto mode. This could be handy, you know, with ISO, if you're going from inside of a building to outside of a building real quick. Just let the camera do the math and figure it out for you. And then once you get to that other, you know, super bright or super dark area, you can hold it again to go back into manual exposure or manual ISO and have all the control that you need and you're golden. Okay, next up, this is sort of the crutch of it all. If you hit menu again and we go all the way down to the setup menu, the yellow one here and go to Operation Customize. And then from Operation Customize, we're going to different set still for movie. This is new to the Sony a7S III, the Sony FX3. What this is going to let you do as you click into here is if you hit the checkbox, you can set all these settings here different between your movie mode and your stills mode. So obviously the important things for me are things like aperture, shutter speed, ISO. I want those to be stuck and sort of whatever I set them last in those modes, I want them to still be the same. So feel free to go through here and check the boxes that you want to have control over separately and then just click OK. And then that is that that lets you keep those settings and you switch quickly between things like aperture priority and the movie mode. Most of the time when I flip to photo mode, I actually like to use aperture priority with auto ISO minimum shutter speed. That special little feature that's in there and I set it to around one two hundred and fifty of a second because I'm usually shooting moving people and that sort of thing. This auto ISO minimum shutter speed is kind of like shooting manual mode, but it gives you the added benefit that it always prioritizes a proper exposure. So that way you don't accidentally under expose something like you could in manual with fast changing lighting environments. Think like concert or stage lighting. Basically auto ISO minimum shutter speed, it tries to always hold that shutter speed that you set as a minimum until your set auto ISO max is maxed out. Think like if you had twelve thousand eight hundred as your as your auto ISO max and then you needed more light, then it's going to drop your shutter speed. OK, then it's going to slow it down that way doesn't under expose it. This is a big Sony camera hidden gem. All that being said, we still need exposure compensation on here. There's not a dial for it. So I set that up on the back dial here with my custom dial set. Over here in the setup menu, we go down to dial customize. Then we have this thing called my dial settings. Click into there and here you have three different sets that you can program however you want. I like to make my stills the same as movies and I'm mostly shooting in aperture priority here. So I have the front dial set to the iris, the rear dial set to ISO. And then because I'm shooting in aperture priority and we don't have an exposure compensation dial and I'm not changing shutter speed, I use that control wheel for my exposure compensation. Works out great. And then I do actually have a second set here for when I was shooting manual. So like I'll do time lapses and whatnot in manual photo mode. And so this mimics how the camera comes and works in that flexible exposure mode. Exactly the same for photo. So we have iris, then we have ISO for that back rear dial and then our shutter speed is that back control wheel. So we have those set up here and the way you set them obviously you just you click in and on it and you can change whatever you want that to be. Okay. I think you can figure that part out. But the thing that's tricky is how do you call those different sets up? Well, you go have to go back over to operation customize, which is in the third menu down and go to custom key set. And you have to set that to a button. So I have mine set to the trash can button. If you click into there, you can toggle and you know, you can set that's whatever you want it to do. I like to have it jump between one, two, three. And since I just have two of them program, it just those two of them. So to see this in action, all we need to do is hit mode to go from movie mode. And we're going to go up to aperture priority. I'm in aperture priority. I hit the trash can button and boom like that you saw right there at the bottom of the screen. It has a star one. That means that our dial set right now anytime I move the dials, it's going to behave like we had set up there. So the front dial is going to be changing my f stops. My back top dial there is going to be changing my ISO, although I like to use auto ISO a lot right there with my minimum shutter speed set. And then the bottom one is my exposure compensation. So just like that, and then if I need to go back and shoot a movie real quick, I just hit mode. And then I can roll it right back down to movie mode. And it remembered all the settings that I had, you know, in that situation right there. So super quick way. Here's movie mode. I hit move mode again. And I go right back up to aperture priority. I can get a picture right back and forth super fast hybrid shooting. Before we wrap up with a couple more tips, I just want to welcome you if this is your first time here to create a video tips.

I'd super appreciate it. Two final things I suggest you turn on for photos in here is to make sure that you're capturing raw files and the compressed raw files are actually great. And then you can also make it easy on yourself by changing between the 16 by nine and three by two aspect ratio by using the quick function menu. If you shoot raw, you still have access to the full frame to adjust the crop later on, but it's super helpful to have that 16 by nine crop photo. That way you can use it for a video thumbnail later on. And now you're ready to quickly snap that photo and flip back in a movie mode with all your settings dialed in perfectly.
