I know I know when it comes to fusion it could be a little scary a little intimidating I don't know about you guys, but I feel like there's just so much to learn and like sometimes I just don't even know what to do in fusion right? I've got an idea, but I have no idea how to accomplish that So we're gonna start out with just an easy fusion tutorial here today guys It's one that I use all the time It's when I want to take this video that you see right now and I want to throw it down into the bottom corner of the screen So I can talk about DaVinci Resolve you can see myself on the screen as well as DaVinci Resolve and I use fusion to make this effect It's really easy. It's actually just one node if you want you can only use one node That's all you really need so let's jump into resolve I'm gonna show you how to do it and maybe you can just get your feet wet here in fusion and Maybe this is even something that you could use in some of your videos. Alright, let's head on over to fusion and don't be scared Don't worry. We got this. It's easy. This one is easy. Let's go So in resolve here I've got my clip in the timeline and we're gonna make the little window that you see me in right now in fusion super easy So we are in the edit tab currently so whatever Project you got going on if you're in the edit tab, we're gonna jump over into fusion. Don't be scared Here we go fusion down at the bottom here. Go ahead and click on the fusion icon now when we're in fusion here I'm actually just gonna come in reset my UI layout So hopefully we're all looking at the same thing and it blows it up on the screen here So I'm gonna go ahead and just resize that to get it back on our screen. Alright, so easy easy all I have to do I have my median one which is my video clip from the edit page and it goes to media out So that's gonna be set up once you jump into fusion here now in order to make this little window Here's what we're gonna do We want to grab this guy right here and you've got two ways you can add it We can click on it and it's just gonna drop it down there in our node area and a node if you're a little confused about that It's just instructions for a change right so we're gonna tell it right now Make the box that goes around the video clip. That's all we're gonna tell it You can add it by just clicking on you know the icon right there Or if I just click on this and I use my backspace or delete key to get rid of it I can select my clip or my median one and then I can click on my little rectangle And it's gonna automatically link them up for us now in my viewer up here You can see that it's cropping it down quite a bit right and that's not what we want Now if you don't see anything in your viewer over here on the right hand side What you need to do come on down to your media out and you see there's two little buttons down there right two little white buttons Well, if you use your keyboard number one and number two That's gonna show you whatever video you want in either the number one viewer on this side or the number two viewer on the right hand side So in this case if I press number two it turns it off if I press number two again It turns it on so it's showing me this node in the viewer So with my rectangle here I want to select it and now I can see my rectangle right here a payer in my right hand viewer So I need to make some adjustments right because it's not the right size There's a few ways that you can adjust it We can come here and just drag it drag it click on it and drag it right and change the size Or we can do it over here in our inspector area so we can just drag this guy up Drag this guy out and what I like to do is because I want it to be the full size of my screen I'm just gonna press in number one for the width and number one for the height and that means it's gonna essentially be a hundred percent Of your frame. We're almost done already The next thing I do is just the corner radius here And I'm just gonna click on that and drag it in and if we take a look at the corner of our video here You can see it starts to bend those corners in and you can make it whatever size you want You want it to be oval shape there? You could do that I usually just drag it in a little bit like that and typically for my videos I'm also gonna reduce the width a little bit because I don't need it this wide I'm gonna shrink that guy down a little bit just so it takes up less space on the screen So I'm gonna come back into my width right here, and I'm just gonna make it a little bit narrower Let's say I like it like that that looks good. That's it. You're done You can leave it here if you want or little bonus tip if you want to just add a little something extra I like to throw a drop shadow on this guy. So in order to do that I'm gonna come back and select my median one here and then I'm going to use my Shift and space bar and that brings up a whole list of all the nodes that we can add So for that little extra drop shadow flare we want to put in there I'm just gonna search down here for drop shadow Say drop there it is. I'm gonna select it. I'm gonna click add and It's gonna add it right into my line of nodes I didn't have to add it in it did it automatically because I had this median one selected So now you can see right up here You can see the drop shadow on the edge of my clip and then in the inspector here You can change you know You want to be darker lighter change the drop to the angle the distance that kind of stuff You've got options there on to you know making it look the way that you want it to look, but that's it now We're done. So I'm just gonna leave it as it is I'm gonna jump back into the edit tab right here and Now in order to get this to go down to the corner of the screen We have the shape that we want so to do the rest of the positioning you can do it right here in the edit tab You don't even have to do it in fusion so I can select my clip come on up grab my Inspector and now I'm just gonna size this up or down and I can put it wherever I want by using my tools in the inspector here Another way you can do it Just click on this guy right here the transform guy and now I can just visually transform it however I want right so I Would come down and shrink it down. I usually do About about maybe that size maybe a little bit smaller right I can put it down there That looks pretty good And if we wanted to make sure that it sits on top of another clip well, I'm gonna come down to my video track I'm gonna move it up a track by either clicking holding and dragging it up Or you want to make sure it goes straight up use your option key on a Mac or alt key on a PC and your arrows Boom, it's gonna just pop it right up a track for you Make sure it goes straight up vertically So let's say I just grabbed this little clip here of of a countdown and now if I play through it I'm just gonna mute my audio so you don't hear it But if I play through it there is my video it's right on top of the track right and if I stop it We can even see the little drop shadow down here happening and that's it It's super easy and this is how I make the little window on my videos all the time. It's really quick and really easy So here's a little bonus tip for you Let's say I'm making my tutorials or my video and I had myself in a little frame like this Well before I make any cuts, I know there's parts of my video where I want this little square of me You know me in a square I want in like a whole bunch of parts of the video right but when I make my tutorials I also you know slide back up the screen I slide back down so it just kind of creates a little more visual interest So how do you do that? It's quick and easy check it out So what I do is I'll have my whole clip and I'll create this effect on the entire clip But let's say I get to a point like right here. Let's just say for example I'm going to make a cut And then let's say I come to here and I make another cut and now I want this part right to go back up to full size Right. I don't want it to be in the little square. Well, what I would do is I would just select my clip I would come to my inspector in the transform section I would reset everything and then now you notice I still have the corners on there right and that's not really how I want it to look Right, so how do I get rid of the corners? Easy just jump back into fusion for your one particular clip and you've got two things you can do you can either select the nodes that you want to delete and hit your delete key or backspace key like that Or what I like to do because sometimes I might want to add it back in what I'll do is I'll just disconnect them Right. So if you hold your shift key and then just click and drag on one of the nodes It's just going to disconnect it Right and I can do that with both of them and I can leave them there like that and now you see up here in our viewer I've got the full window there and if I ever want to put the effect back onto this clip The nodes who are already there all I have to do is drag them back on and to do that You could just for example, click your drop shadow hold your shift key Hover it over the line. Let go boom. There it goes rectangle. Click my little square guy here Drag it to your median one. Boom. There we go. And now that effect is applied to that clip again But in this case, I'm just going to disconnect them like I already said And if you did want to delete them no problem, you can just windows select both of them Hit your delete key. Boom. They're gone. You don't even have to worry about them So jumping back into the edit tab now, how do you make it go from this right the little guy in the corner here to the big one? But have it not pop back up, right? Maybe you want a little transition in there So here's the tip that I use on how to do that I'm going to come to my effects library video transitions And I've created some custom transitions a slide up and a slide down But it's really easy all you got to do is come to the slide up and slide down transitions So right here we have slide up So I'm going to come and put that right on my transition there Now here by default, I think I don't know how many frames it is But here's what it looks like by default and for me that was a little slow So I like to speed it up a little so I'm going to come here and speed up my transition. I'm going to make it 12 seconds. I mean sorry 12 frames 12 frames. And now here's what that looks like Boom sides right up and then you can do the same thing to slide down just use the slide down transition We've got slide down right here Going to drop it on my clip Going to shrink it down a little bit 12 frames almost said seconds there 12 frames And here's what it looks like sliding from our full video back down to the little video So that's it guys real easy to create this cool effect here in fusion You don't have to be scared of fusion just take it step by step And this is one of the things I got to work on this year. I really want to get in there a little more learn some more I'm going to be checking out some of my fellow DaVinci resolve youtubers to learn fusion a little bit better and just Continue to learn more about the program how to do all these different things because this is so much to know It's it's uh, it's kind of daunting sometimes. Let's be honest but hey, we got a whole year 2023 here where we can figure out all this stuff learn together and uh That's about it guys easy fusion tutorial here. Let me know what you think. Did you like this kind of video? Do you want to see more basic stuff like this and uh, yeah, and with that said guys? I look forward to seeing you in the next video. Peace Oh man, yeah, I'm kicking so I got so many light stands over here. I'm kicking everything. I got the mic stand I'm kicking it. I got I got the other light stand. I'm kicking it again Coming up. I think in uh soon here We are going to be rearranging the studio setup because I just feel like this isn't working for me anymore You know what I'm saying? It's just not working. We got a we got a we got a upper game or something here So we're going to do a little basement reno. I think All right, let's jump in the resolve check this out, bro So
