Quick update on the 100,000 subscribers giveaway. I'm gonna be randomly drawing from all of the emails that I've received to pick winners next Monday, February 12th, 2024. So if you haven't jumped in on the giveaways yet, links in the description below. You can go over my Shopify page, plug in your email over there, and you'll be entered to be randomly selected to win one of the awesome prizes. So if you haven't seen the video with what the prizes are, I'll link it up here. I'll link it down below. Maybe link it in the comments. Check it out and you're gonna wanna get in and win any one of these things. I mean, they're all fantastic giveaways. And if you do win, I'll be reaching out to you through email and letting you know what the prize is that you've won and how to redeem that prize. And we also have a freebie for everyone and that is the Waves plugin, the Manny Marko win EQ. I'm gonna have a video coming out about that next Monday. I'm gonna explain how it works, show you how to get it installed and running in DaVinci Resolve. So stay tuned for that video because you're gonna be able to hit a link up in that video and go over and get the plugin for free for 48 hours. But if you missed that 48 hour window, you're not gonna be able to get it for free. So I want all you guys to get in there and get that plugin for free. If you have any questions, comments or perhaps a concern, leave it in the comments below. And with that said, I hope you guys win and I'll see you in the next video. Peace.
