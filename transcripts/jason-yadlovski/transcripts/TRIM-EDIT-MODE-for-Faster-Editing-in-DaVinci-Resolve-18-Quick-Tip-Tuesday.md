It's Quick Tip Tuesday and I'm going to show you two ways I've been using the trim edit mode to help make my editing a little bit easier. Let's check this out. So if you don't know where the trim edit mode tool is, I'm currently in the edit tab right up here next to our arrow above our timeline. We have this guy right here, the trim edit mode. Now I've been going through and putting together some b-roll lately for a little project I was working on. And if you take a look here, you can see we just kind of go from shot to shot. Here I'll play a second up for you. So sometimes when I'm putting shots like this together where I've got a lot of b-roll, I'm trying to match stuff up to the beat of the music, I need to adjust clips a little bit, right? And if I zoom in here, I don't always need to adjust the clip like this, right? Maybe it's wherever I had it is good. But what is showing in the clip is not exactly what I want to see, right? So for example, this part right here, let's say I want to use a different part of this clip. Why can come up here, select my trim edit mode. And then if I just hover on the top part of the clip here, I can click, hold and drag. And it's actually going to allow me to scrub through different parts of the clip. So if I zoom out a little bit here, and then select that same clip, you can see the white box there that tells me how long that clip is. So this clip is actually pretty long. So I can scrub back and forth and choose whatever part of that clip that I want while keeping the same limits of the clip that I already have in my timeline. So it's really sweet. So for example, let's just take a look at another one here, zoom in just a little bit, got a guitar picture here. So if I click, hold now you can see right there, we see the limits of my whole clip. And as I scrub back and forth up in my viewer, I can see which part will be shown. So let's say I want to see this part. And I'm going to go go ahead and just play through it. Let's say I don't like that, I'm going to scrub through and try a different part of the clip. So just click, hold drag, let's go like maybe right there. All right, cool. That's it. So that's the first way that I use it. And I use it all the time when I'm putting together tons of b-roll kind of like this. The other thing that this tool can do is if you have a gap in your timeline, so I'm just going to create a little gap here for myself, we're going to grab a couple clips, pull these over. So now that we've got this gap in my timeline here, let's say I'm putting together my b-roll and I want to scoot everything over a little bit, but maybe not delete the whole gap, right? If I use my delete key, it would delete the whole gap. So if I come with my trim edit mode selected, and I come to the end of this clip and I select this icon right here, I can click, hold, and it's going to bring everything over with it. It's going to essentially get rid of whatever part of the gap that I want to, right? Say I want to line it up here, and then maybe I had some other clips to dump in. And then, oh, maybe I got to move it back a little bit. So again, I'm going to find that icon that looks like that just before the clip, click, hold, and I could push it all back out. So I don't have to select all the clips to be able to do that. Works out really quick and easy to move things around your timeline while you're trying to build out some cool b-roll. So the trim edit mode does do some other cool stuff, but those are primarily the two things that I use it for. So that is today's quick tip Tuesday, guys. If you like this one, maybe give the video a little thumbs up for me, subscribe if you aren't already. And with that said, I'll see you guys in the next video. Peace!
