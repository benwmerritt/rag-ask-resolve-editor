## Transcript
What's happening guys? Welcome back to the series where I'm answering your questions that you leave in comments because I know a lot of people don't read through other people's comments. I get it. So I'm going to make videos about answering those questions because a lot of you guys have the same questions. And I mean, really, I just see the same questions all the time. So this is a little video. I'm going to call it like a video podcast here of answering your questions here from my YouTube channel on all my videos and stuff like that. It's going to mostly be based around DaVinci Resolve. But sometimes you guys ask other questions, whether it's about YouTube or gear or stuff like that, but mostly focused around DaVinci Resolve and the questions you guys have. So let's just jump right into it. We got a couple of questions here. The first one here is the wavy effect won't drop onto the plain text for me. It does drop onto the text plus just FYI. So this is on my Mr. Beast text video, how to make texts like Mr. Beast in your videos. You may need to use text plus to drop on the effect there. And we're talking about the wavy effect here. So let's just jump over into resolve here. Now, if I come over to resolve and let's say I want to drop the wavy effect onto a piece of text, let's just come to the end of our area here. I'm going to go ahead and bring up my effects, grab a plain piece of text, some basic title right there. Make this a little bigger so you guys can see it, our basic title. And let's say if I want to throw in the waviness, I'm going to come to my open effects filters down to the bottom where there is wavy waviness. Let's drop it on there. Let's say and yeah, it doesn't look like it lets you go on there. It looks like it has to be text plus in order to use the wavy feature or the wavy effect there. So if I just grab my text plus, boom, drop it down, grab that wavy effect again, filters all the way down here, waviness, drop it on my text. And there we go. So you need to use text plus in order to have that wavy effect applied onto your text if you want to talk like MrBeast text. So keep that in mind. Next question. Hi, great video. I wanted to solve a problem and I tried everything you said, but it didn't help. I'm about to do a voiceover. I patched the input with the track. I'm using a mono track. It isn't recording any sound even though I have the R on the track, which is arm the track to record. And I also check the output. I've chosen the right fast track track, but there aren't any sound coming in. Hmm, annoying. I have to keep on searching. Thanks a lot for your videos. And then now we commented and now it worked. I don't know what I did differently, but thanks for the video. So sometimes people have problems when you're trying to patch in a microphone. So just jumping into resolve here. If you jump over into Fairlight musical notes at the bottom, when you're trying to patch in your microphone, make sure your microphone like this one here is hooked up your computer before you open resolve. That way, when you open resolve, it should see it and it should just pick it up automatically. But then in order to patch it, you want to go to Fairlight right here, patch input output. And that's going to bring up this window right over here for you. You want audio inputs on this side. You're going to select your microphone or audio interface, whatever it might be. And then on this side, destination, you're going to track select track input. And then you could select your track and then you would just, you know, select the ones you want to patch, come down here and hit patch. I'm not going to do it now because I don't want to do that, but that's how you would do it. Now, sometimes this window will like disappear. All right. So if I click over here, the window is gone, but then if I come back to Fairlight, we'll patch input output. It does where to go. It's gone. What? So you actually just have to come back and hit patch input output again, the Fairlight menu, and then it'll pop back up. It's kind of like the windows get lost, you know, in there, whatever. So and then once you do that, once you have it patched, make sure you hit your R on your track right over here, right? So if you're patched in, hit that R and then you go ahead and hit record. And then everything should work out all right for you. So that's how you get set up to do a voiceover. If you have problems, give everything a restart, make sure your resolve is seen your microphone. But generally, yeah, that's, that's how you do it. And if it's not working for you, I hate to tell you, but you're probably doing something wrong. Did I say that out loud? Oops. Anyway, next question. All right. Really well informative made tutorial about the Blue Yeti about the best settings. Thanks, man. I did get a lot of thank yous and, and, and you know, appreciate the video helped me a lot. All those, I try to keep those out of this video because I mean, you guys don't care about people giving me kudos to you. I don't think so. So anyway, moving along. Great text. Try that in my next project. Obviously when this some here, sorry about that. Can you import an SRT file on the subtitles video here? Yes, you can import subtitle files that you already have in order to do that. Just jump over and resolve here. So in the edit page here, if I come to my media pool, I can right click in here and say import subtitle. And that's going to allow you to import any subtitles that you might have already created outside of resolve or anything you want to import in. So that's how you would bring in subtitles. All right. Question on the how to sync audio and video clips in DaVinci Resolve 17 fast, which is the same for DaVinci Resolve 18. Just to let you guys know, Hey, what if I have one long audio file, but multiple different clips? How does the syncing work for that? It works fine. I've had one long clip where I have say a screen recording. And then when I was recording on my 5D Mark 4, it would break up my clips into various segments. So I would just do one at a time. I would put my video clip with your scratch audio on top of your other clip that you want to sync it up and I would sync them up. And usually it does a pretty good job of being able to sync multiple clips together with, you know, one long clip. If you do have trouble, sometimes what you can try is creating a multi cam clip and that's going to sync it better for you. It just depends on your clip. But I mean, I've found that usually it works pretty good to be able to slink sync multiple video clips with good scratch audio to with, you know, and one long audio clip. That's a continuous recording. So usually it works pretty good for me. All right. How to blur face or objects in DaVinci Resolve 17, which is the same in or in 16, which is the same as 17 and 18. What is option S on Windows option S is the same as alt S. And I guess maybe because I came from a Windows background before I jumped on Mac eventually, I just thought it was like common knowledge that option is the same as alt. So on your keyboard here, option right there. Same as the alt key. Same thing. Option all same thing. So it's always option, whatever on Mac and on a PC, it's all whatever, whatever the shortcut is. So easy to remember. And that's always the same coming on. No audio in DaVinci Resolve 17 or 18, whatever you got. Hey, thanks for the video. Just solve my issue. Had to patch the bus to the audio outputs. I never had this problem before. So if you are having audio problems, let's just take a look at resolve here, jump into Fairlight. If your bus isn't going to the output, sometimes right up here, you're going to have, you might have multiple buses or you might have your side chain. You can check that. This bus one wants to be selected up here to send your audio out. All right. Next comment on the Mr. Beast text. Thank you. This is awesome. I would have done it the hard way rather than cutting the text clip. I would have made a bunch of text clips first, then tried to adjust them all individually. You save me so much time. Thanks as always. So this is a good one for you guys to know on my Mr. Beast video. I showed how you can take one piece of text, for example, let's make this a little bigger here. So let's say I have this one piece of text right here. Let's stretch it way out. And let's say I'm going to make a bunch of different pieces of text, right? Well, instead of making a bunch of little pieces of text, maybe I'll cut this one up. I'll have, you know, text here. Oh, hold on. Cut. You know, we got all these little pieces of text. And then let's say I want to make a change, like, you know, make them all, I don't know, a different font or something like that. Just going to come over here and pick that. So now I've got a different font, which happens to be all boxes. Well, who cares? Doesn't matter. You get the idea. But what you can do instead of then going through and adjusting every single clip individually, which is going to take time, what I do and what I said in the Mr. Beast video is make this text clip real long. Come in here, adjust it, however you want, change the font to be whatever you want. I don't know. Let's go with the Mr. Beast font here. Or yeah, there it is. This and we'll just say, Mr. Beast. I've got that. Now I can come in and change, you know, say my shading. I want the red outline there. I'm going to make it a little bit thicker. You know, you could throw the black shadow on there, whatever. You can make all the changes that you want and then go through and cut up your text clip this way. It's got all the changes that you want. Everything's going to look exactly the same. You don't have to go through, you know, a hundred little pieces of text clips and change it to be how you want. And then if you need more text clips, you could just grab this guy, stretch it out and then boom, you can just continue cutting up that clip, moving it around, whatever you want to do. But this way you're just going to set the clip once and then you're good to go. You can just make multiple, make multiple uses of that particular clip and just cut it. So that's what I did in the Mr. Beast video. And it's quick, easy and just kind of helps speed things up a little bit. Question on the copy, paste color grade nodes with one click in DaVinci Resolve 17, select the clip you want to and middle click the clip from which you want to copy it. All right. That just looks like it's, you know, hey, don't bother watching the video. It takes too long from to get to the point. Just do this, which is right. That's all you got to do. All right. Next one on the Mr. Beast text, cool text effect. I wasn't expecting much about font text titles. Use that effect. Thank you for sharing. I learned a lot or I learned from you. I'm deaf and I try to create subtitle captions while, while something, while ASL something in tutorials. I don't know what that means. Missions gaming. Do you have other tutorial zoom like move look closer to the screen to zoom in and out? Okay. So it sounds like you just want to know, do I have a tutorial on how to zoom in and out? Well, so when I do it in my recording program here, I actually do it in, in my screen recording software, which I can't bring up at the moment because I'm actually using it to record my screen. So, but I will show you guys, I got to make a video about that because people ask all the time, how do you zoom in and do the little, you know, circle zoom in thing or, you know, blow apart of the screen. How do you do that? And you can do it in DaVinci Resolve. You would just, you know, go to your clip or whatever and you would just, you know, come to your settings and you just zoom it in, you know, do it like that. You could key frame it and all that. But when I'm doing my screen recording, it's a lot quicker and easier for me to do it in screen flow, my screen recording software and just I have presets for those zooms. So anywhere I want it to, you know, zoom into the little red circle there, like on the screen, I want to put my mouse over here on by the title zoom in. I just put that preset right on the clip and it just does it. It's super quick and easy to use screen flow to do that stuff. So that's how I would do that. All right. Just next one here. Awesome tutorial. I do have a video about an airplane and there is background music. How to remove the music and leave the airplane noise to avoid a copyright strike. Well, you probably can't remove the music and keep an airplane noise. If you had somebody talking and you want to remove the background music, you can do that using clarity VX, which is a plugin from waves works really well. I tried it. I played in my studio here, played music and I talked in the microphone and then I put that effect on my audio track, totally remove the music. It was pretty mind blowing, but I don't think that's going to work when you want to keep an airplane noise because that particular plugin is looking for a human voice to isolate. So you're not going to find that it's going to work with keeping airplane noise. What I would do is I would just mute all your audio track and I'd go grab some airplane noise from, I don't know, some stock music or stock, you know, effect site or something like that. And that's what I would do. I would just put in some fake airplane music or airplane noise so that way you can get rid of the music and all the sound that's already in your video. Next one, bro had an intro and outro and things to say in under 50 seconds. You are too powerful. Oh, thanks, man. This was a remake because I did another video with these joining clips and man, people ripped me a new one because I took too long to get to the point. It's so quick, but what are you going to do? So I made another video where you get it all done in 30 seconds and you get the tip. That was a long time ago, but yeah, thanks, man. Right here, my DaVinci Resolve doesn't have the speaker setup tab. It's got to be there because the free end studio version, they have it. So I'm thinking maybe you're not doing something right. I don't know. I'm assuming this is the screen you're talking about in Resolve. If we come to DaVinci Resolve preferences and then we come to audio video in slash out and we look right here. We're looking for our input device and our output device. Right now, this is my screen recording software. My input device is the EVO 4, which is my audio interface for this guy. If you uncheck this automatic speaker configuration, you're going to see all your speaker configuration stuff there and you can adjust that there if you want to. Just leave it checked on now. So it's there. You might just have to double check and make sure you're under system audio video in slash out. I slash O and make sure it's right there. So that's it. All right. Next up, Hound Dog, Mech. It would be nice that when text is placed, lower thirds, etc., they're placed above the red YouTube progress bar. The reason is especially in instruction videos that I slash we must stop the video to read the text title because it's not displayed long enough. And on occasion, I do wish to single frame back and forth. That way the red progress bar online associated things don't cover up the text. Just a suggestion, but there's always an option to run the video at half or quarter speed and let you sound drunk. That's true. Yeah. I bet I talk so fast you play it at half speed. I still sound kind of normal. You don't say, Jersey, what are you going to do about that? Right? But yeah, now he's got a point there. I mean, you know, if you're hovering over the video on YouTube, yeah, in Texas too far down, you could definitely get in the way of the progress bar there. So something to keep in mind. And maybe I can make a video on that. Like, where do I place it? Right? If I bring in an image of a YouTube video, put it on there so I know where that progress bar is going to be. You know, where should I put my text? All right. Moving down, paste in any track. Hey, Jason, still didn't work any other suggestions. So let's jump over into resolve. So pasting onto tracks is sometimes kind of a pain. You want to make sure whatever track you want to paste on has this little red box around it. And that should mean that it's going to paste onto that track. And if it doesn't, what I would do is I would just turn off all these guys, the auto track selectors. I think if you hold, yeah, if you hold shift, it's going to un or it's going to turn all of them off for your audio. And if I come up here and make these tracks a little bit bigger here, I can hold shift, click this, and it turns them all off. So now I'm only going to turn on wherever I want, you know, my clip to get pasted. So if I only want to paste my clip on track three, boom, there we go. And then when you're done, you can just shift click and turn all these guys back on. So that way, whenever you make edits and cuts and stuff, that'll be turned on and it should carry through for all the tracks or any tracks that you want to affect. So that's how you would paste to whatever track you want. All right. Here's one from Nathaniel. Hey, my brother, I really need your help. I desire to soon start my personal YouTube channel and I bought all the stuff I need, including the shore SM seven B microphone, which is a sweet microphone. It's kind of like this guy here. Right? This one sounds pretty good. It doesn't cost nearly as much either, but that SM seven B, that's an awesome microphone. Now, I also watch your videos a lot because you're a very helpful person and really like and really edit the videos really well. Well, thank you, sir. But I'm not getting through when it comes to audio. I've recorded the audio tracks already and recorded the audio. Oh, I've recorded the video tracks already recorded the audio, but even after following the steps from your videos, how to edit my audio, my audio is still sounding distorted and not clear. I've looked at your videos or your audio videos too. And I keep trying, but it's been months now and I'm not getting through. Can you please help me in some way? So just read it based on your, your comment here that you recorded the video and you recorded the audio, but your audio is still sounding distorted and not clear. So it's a problem when you're recording it, right? Whether it's your, your levels are not correct. Maybe you, if you're using an audio interface, does it have enough power? I don't know if the SM seven B needs phantom power. Do you have phantom power turned on? If you need it, I'm not sure about that microphone off the top of my head, but you probably want to look at your recording setup. Maybe how it's connected to the computer. Maybe you need to swap out some cables. Sometimes the cables, the XLRs are, I think that's an XLR, the SM seven B or USB either way. Sometimes the cables are shot and, and they just, they don't work well. So swap out the cable, but it's definitely something with your recording. I would fix that and figure out what the problem is there instead of trying to fix it in post, because if you don't have something good to start with, it's going to be really hard to fix it up there in post. So look at your setup and how you're recording into your computer. Look at your audio interface, make sure everything's set up, make sure you got good levels coming in. You're not piquing things like that. And that's where I would start. And then once you can get a good signal in, you can start to work with it and work in post with it. All right. Next up on the Mr. B's text, whole bias. Yes, I need more of these text videos, mostly for Tik Tok. I've been doing my own, but I can't get emojis right. They lack movement. So these kinds of content is really appreciated. I'm not sure what you mean by you can't get the emojis right. I mean, I would maybe just use some images and then you can do whatever you want with the image, right? Just grab the emoji image, throw it on there, and then you can apply effects to it easily and do whatever you want there. But yeah, I mean, any of these kind of videos and text techniques and stuff could work for a Tik Tok too, not just YouTube and regular format video. It could work for vertical video too. Next, can you please do Alex Hormoza? Hormozy. Who is this guy? Let me look this guy up real quick. Yes, just look that guy up. Yes, I have heard of him. I don't know exactly what you want me to do there. I haven't really watched too much of his videos, but maybe I'll check it out and see if I can figure out what you're talking about there or drop another comment there and let me know what you mean. All right. The next one is just an I appreciate you. Thanks, man. Jonathan, appreciate that. All right. How to check the color profile in Windows. I'm not really sure because I don't really use Windows too much. I've never tried looking for it. I imagine it would be in property somewhere. Maybe I'm not sure or you could try looking at it in Resolve. Maybe it'll tell you there. I'm not really sure. Sorry. Sorry. I can't help you out there too much more. Looks like we got a comment on how to add background, background behind text after two years after posting. You're still helping viewers. That's great. I try to make content that's relevant. And really all my DaVinci Resolve 15, 16, 17 videos, it all applies to 18. It's all just building on each other. The way they've built Resolve is they've just added to it, made things better, but all those basic tips, tricks and everything like that from a while back, but they're all going to be relevant and work just as well in DaVinci Resolve 18 today. All right. Looks like we got a question. I can't get my Paner to show in my mixer and the Paner option is already chosen. Please help. This is in a surround sound video. So sometimes I know there's issues with looking for, you know, this is the Paner here that he's talking about. I can see it right here in the edit tab, but if I jump over into Fairlight, you should also be able to see it. If you scroll down right here, if you can't see it and you check this and you went to where's the pan and that's turned on and you're still not seeing it. I'm not sure why you might not be seeing it. It should be there. It should be showing up. The other thing I can think is scroll up and down. If it's not, maybe give everything a restart, maybe try a new project, try a new timeline or something. I don't know why it wouldn't show up, but if that's checked on, you should see it. All right. Comment on how to save open effect settings in DaVinci Resolve 18 from broke to rich. Change your life. Sounds like a good idea. Is there a source where we normal users can download the normal effects and use them like all the normal video editor softwares like HitFilm or PowerDirector have it so that you can just choose an effect on the left menu and use it and later adjust it. Like ready to use speech bubble or hearts or which coming from top over the footage. Okay. So I don't know about all that normal talk stuff, but basically you can get presets and things. Motion Array is one place that has tons of great assets that are just drag and drop that you can use. I use their stuff all the time. It's a lot of great stuff. I don't know how HitFilm or PowerDirector work. I've never used them. I don't even know what they look like. So I'm not familiar with how they're set up and how things work in there, but the results just set up a little bit different. So if you have assets, I mean, you can have presets. You can have things made. You can use power bins. You can just drag stuff in. It sounds like the result maybe just has a little bit different setup than what you're used to. So I would look in the power bins and then just other kinds of templates or footage things that you can use for your video that you might need to pick up from somewhere like Motion Array. So that's what I would do and how I would go about trying to get those assets in every project. Next one, how to make YouTube shorts or TikTok videos individually. Resolve 17 or 18. Great video. How do you repurpose a long form video into shorts? Well, a quick little tip here. If you are in the cut tab, right? I'm not a cut tab guy, but if I'm in cut tab and let's say I have this video and I want to repurpose it for a vertical style short, I mean, obviously I'm going to have to cut it down because this video is too long. And actually, you know what I want to do is I'm going to make a copy of this timeline because I don't want to mess it up. So I do that. I'm just going to come to my timeline, right click and duplicate the timeline. And I'm just going to change to recording copy. So in the cut page here, the quickest way that you can just go from a horizontal video to a vertical video is come up here and you can click on this little icon right here. See this guy hit this little drop down. Boom. Portrait 1080 by 1920. You can just hit that. And then boom, it's going to drop your video onto a portrait timeline. They might have to scale it, you know, and obviously trim it if it's more than a minute, but that's how you can quickly go from, you know, a widescreen video, regular 1920 by 1080 video to a 1080 by 1920 video for vertical format. And if you want to go back, boom, change it back. There you go. It changes it right back for you. So that's the quickest way to do it here in resolve. You could always make a new timeline, copy things over, do all that too. Just depends on what you want to do. Question on, copy and paste, color grade nodes in one click. How do I copy grading from one node to the other on the same clip? Jump into resolve here. Let's jump into the color tab. Take a look. So let's say I have settings on here. I'm going to hit commander control C. We go ahead and add a new node in here. Click that guy, commander control V. And it's going to paste all my settings on there. So just commander control C, commander control V for you to copy from one node onto another node. And you want to just copy the settings from that one node, not everything from an entire clip, in which case you could use your middle mouse button here to copy everything from one clip. So, you know, from here to there, you could just middle mouse button click and it'll copy all of the nodes there for you in the whole color grade. But if you just want to do one, one node here, select the node, commander control C copy, go to your next node, commander control V paste. All right. On episode one, we have a question here of answering your questions and comments about DaVinci Resolve. It says, Hey, is there a way DaVinci Resolve finds silent parts of your video and have them deleted automatically? Keep it up. Yeah, actually there is. It is called the boring detector. You can find it in the cut tab here. And it's this little guy right here, this little ZZZ thing. So if I click on that, it'll bring up this window here and it's going to say, let me know when edits are longer than, in this case, 29 seconds is the default, right? We can change this to be whatever we want, but say longer than seven seconds and tell me that they're boring. If I have jump cuts, you can make those in edits that are shorter than seven frames, they're jump cuts, and then we can analyze. And now it's going to show me all the areas here where it detected that, right? So you can come in here and you can make the changes, make adjustments or cut out those parts, whatever you want to do, but it's going to tell you where all those boring parts are. So hopefully that tool will help you out. Hi, is it possible to add keyframes or timings? I want a beep sound to go from high to low in a slope. I can't seem to animate, find out how to animate the pitch. Sure. So if you have no few ways, you could probably do it in the edit tab here. If you have a audio clip selected, let's go ahead and close my mixer here. We got a little more space. Open this guy up. So under audio here, we have pitch. Yeah, you can't keyframe it here. Like you said, there's no way to keyframe it, but what you could do is jump into Fairlight and let's say I have a clip here. Let's just come to the end. I'm going to grab a little clip that we can do this with. Okay. And let's say I want to throw the pitch effect on there. So I'm going to go to my effects library and we have pitch and drop that on there. And here's where we can change our pitch. So let's take it from there. Then we're going to, we want it to fade all the way to here by the end of the clip. So I'm going to leave it there. Here's what it sounds like. All right. Nice dark, deep voice there. So now what we do is make sure I've got my automation controls on here and then we can change any one of these things through automation, which means as the video is playing, we can change the things over time. So I'm going to select plugins. I don't need to select EQ. I was working with the EQ earlier. And then what I could do is just come here down in my track. I'm going to check this guy. We're going to come down to plugins. And actually now that I'm looking at it with the plugins here, we actually need to add the effect not to just the clip, but to the entire track. So I'm going to come up and delete this effect here. Effects. Boom. Delete it. Now I'm going to add the pitch onto the entire track. I can just drop it there, drop these semitones down. And now when I come in here, I should be able to come down to plugins, pitch. And we're going to want to change the semitones. So we should be good with that. Now I'm going to turn on right here by clicking this little guy, turn on the automation controls. And now I'm going to just play through the video. And then when I get to the end, I'm just going to flip that dial all the way back so that it should change over time. All right, so I'm not going to play to the end of the clip because I don't want you guys to sit there that long. But look, here's how it worked. Now you can see where the automation line is and here's what it sounds like. And that's how you could change the pitch in this case. You can do this with anything, right? Almost any of your audio effects, examples, faders, you know, buttons, knobs, dials, all kinds of stuff you can automate here to change over time. So that's how you would do it. And I think that'll work out just fine for you. Now if you need to put this in its own track, just put your clip in its own track with the effect on just that track. So that way you're not affecting a whole bunch of other stuff. And then you can use the automation tools on just that clip. And you should be good to go and get the effect that you're looking for. All right, I like this comment from Manuela, Manuela, I think. Everyone, it's worth it. Buy it. So this is on the best background audio noise reduction plugin, which is of course the Waves Clarity VX. It does work awesome when we've got speaking and there's other stuff going on in the background. Fantastic plugin works really well. Quick note, on a Mac, you have to run the Venture Resolve in Rosetta because it's not native on Mac yet, but it works fine on PC. And it does work fine on Mac when you run Resolve in Rosetta too. So keep that in mind. But I know Waves is working on it, and it should be native on Mac hopefully sometime soon. But yeah, awesome plugin. If you need background noise reduction, highly recommend Waves Clarity VX. Link in the description below for that if you want it. All right, another question here. Hello, Jason. Great channel. By the way, been watching you for a number of years now. Thanks, man. Appreciate that. This is Yorkie Bits and Bob's Home Tech. Thanks, Bob. My question is, I record using two or more cameras, but I use a Zoom H6 for audio, but I'm still unable to auto sync audio anymore. I look at the audio on the cameras in the Venture Resolve 18, and for the first 10 or 20 seconds of audio is missing, all except for the Zoom H6. What am I doing wrong? Or is it a setting that I missed? Well, that's strange that you'd be missing the first, you know, what is it, 10 or 20 seconds of audio there in the Venture Resolve from your cameras. I'm wondering how you're starting at the very beginning of your recording, maybe, you know, record for a minute and just say a few things, just to have some, you know, dummy footage in the beginning. So you're not starting directly at the beginning of your clip. I'm not clear by what you said if your Zoom H6 is going directly into your camera, or if you're just recording separate on Zoom H6, and then you're syncing it up afterwards. But I would try and make your clips a little bit longer when you're recording, so that way, maybe that first 10 or 20 seconds, like you don't need it, you just record a little extra, and then kind of pick it up after that at some point. Or if you're having problems syncing it, shorten those clips up into Venture Resolve, or even shorten up your Zoom clips, so that way Resolve has less to look at, sync those up, and then just expand your clips back out. That's probably what I would try. Next video, I answer your questions. Can you make a video on how to edit like MrBeast? Would be perfect. I guess maybe I could. I don't know. I'd have to watch some of his videos, take a lot of notes. Basically, it's a lot of fast cuts, and you got to tell the good story. I feel like I'm a terrible storyteller. I mean, I just make tutorial videos. So I mean, I try to incorporate a story in there somehow, because I tangled up my headphones. I don't know that I'm all that good at it. I feel like I'm a terrible storyteller, even in real life, let alone here on YouTube. I feel like I'm not great at telling stories. But anyway, I mean, maybe I could look into that. It's a lot of fast cuts and making sure that there's always something that's grabbing your audience's attention. That's kind of how he does his videos, at least from what I've noticed. Next up, Magic Codes. Hi, thank you for this great video. How to fade in and out subtitles. So if you're using just subtitle text, I don't think you can fade it in and out. I'm not 100% sure on that. But let me just throw in a subtitle text here and take a look. Let's see. We got our titles, and we got scroll down to the bottom, subtitle, drop that in there. And I don't think we have any adjustments on here. Yeah, there's no handles up there to fade it in. And I do have those turned on, right? Yep. Yeah, we should be good. So I don't think you can fade it in if you're using an actual subtitle text. I think if you did normal text and you made that into a subtitle, well, then you can go ahead and fade it in. But if you're using the subtitle text itself, you can't have it fade in there. All right, then we got one more here. I'm going to go through it says blur on the blur of the background of a photo or video. This is using the blanking fill effect that we have in resolve. It says great video. Thank you. I'm trying to do do it another way around having difficulty. So I have a 2.7k video. I'm trying to make mobile form. I want to zoom in and fill the gaps with blanking fill. However, when I try, there is fill on all four sides. I want it only on the top and the bottom. My video fills the whole thing. But when I put the filling, it extends to the edges to the right and left. My video is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. My timeline is that I tried putting the timeline to 1080 by 1520. But I get the same results. Can you help? So one of the problems that I notice sometimes with the blanking fill is that it will automatically crop it a little bit, which would give you some of the fill effect on the sides that you don't want it. So jumping back into resolve here. Let's say on this clip, I want to use the blanking fill. If I just go grab it, go to open effects filters and down to blanking fill. Where are you? There you are. Blanking fill. We drop this on there. Boom. So now you can see what it's doing here. And sometimes in the effect, under blanking fill, you have where you crop. Where's the crop source? Right here under source. See how it's automatically cropping it in a little bit. So you can just pull that out and it's not going to crop it in, right? See how it's cropping the video there. So sometimes that's turned on by default a little bit like it was for me, 0.5 there. I don't know why. So that could be why your video is not extending out for the entire screen and why the blanking fill isn't working exactly the way that you wanted it to. That was a little tricky one that caught me by surprise a few times too when I was trying to use the blanking fill. All right, guys. Well, that wraps up this one. That was a bunch more questions that you guys have. I'm going to keep doing this for a little while. See if you guys find it helpful. If you like it, let me know. If you don't like it, let me know that too. That way I don't have to waste my time here, right? But I think it's going to be helpful for you guys as I just kind of go through and answer questions here that you guys have asked on all my other videos, whether it's DaVinci Resolve, mostly DaVinci Resolve, but sometimes you guys ask other questions too. So drop your questions. I'm going to go back and I'll answer all these things online too. So that way the original poster has the answers that they're looking for. But yeah, hopefully this helps you guys out and just answering more questions that you have here in DaVinci Resolve. All right. Well, with that said, I look forward to seeing you guys in the next episode. This was episode two in the books here. And with that said, I'm out of here. I think I got to go blow some leaves or do something like that. Get some yard work done. Got to get some yard work done. So you guys have a great day and I'll see you guys in the next video. All right, peace.
