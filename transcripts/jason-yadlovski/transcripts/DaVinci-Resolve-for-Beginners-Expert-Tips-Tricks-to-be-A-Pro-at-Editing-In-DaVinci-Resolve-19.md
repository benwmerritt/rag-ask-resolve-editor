What's going on guys welcome to today's video today. We're gonna do another hangout and edit with me type of video I just got done filming a keyframes hack slash tips video something I just learned literally yesterday and I'm like I gotta make a video for this and put it out there for you guys So my goal here is to finish this edit in half an hour because I have a another class I have to attend in half an hour So we're gonna see how far we can get figured I'd throw on the camera again here Bunch of you guys like the the way I did the last one just editing through my thought process I haven't done anything yet. I'm starting from scratch The only thing that I've done so far is I recorded everything I screen recorded everything and I edited my screen recording where I just add in the different either whether it's a blow-up or You know a highlight box or something like that I do that in my screen recording program because it's really quick and really easy. So that's done But let's just jump and resolve and get working on this project. So in DaVinci resolve here This is what we've got so far This is the sample video file that I use to show how the keyframes get like automatically created for you So I don't need that right now cuz now I'm just gonna go ahead and create this YouTube video So the first thing I want to do is bring in all of my footage So I'm gonna go to my folder here and Grab all my parts and pieces. So I've got my good audio here recorded for my external recording I like to bring in my footage from the C100 and then once I've got those two in there I like to just come here I'm just gonna right-click and I'm gonna come down to auto sync audio to sync up my good audio It's gonna do it for me and say by waveform Sync and I always give a good clap in the beginning of my recordings just to make sure there's a good sync point That's done now. We can go back to My folders here. I'm gonna grab my screen recording Drop that in and that is pretty much all I need to get started here This was a pretty quick video. So not too much to it there We may add some more things in as we go, but that's where we're gonna start So the next thing that I like to do is I use a program called Recut Big thanks to Casey Ferris for telling me about this program and what this does is it automatically cuts out all the silences for you and Will spit out a timeline that I can then just bring into DaVinci Resolve So it speeds up the workflow a lot. So to use it really easy I'm just gonna go ahead and grab my video footage drop it in I'm gonna grab my screen recording as well So grab my screen recording from here drop that in and now I'm gonna line these up in the Recut program so I can zoom in just using my commander control plus and minus And I'm just gonna line these clips up and I like I said, I always do a good clap here So I could see where I need to line them up and that looks pretty good All right, there you go, I do a lot of weird stuff in my videos too because it's just I think it's funny So now that those are lined up we can see that there's these pink areas So those are the areas that'll get cut out. I can make adjustments here if I want to I could say remove silence and it's gonna take out all those silences But notice where they overlap right where maybe I'm talking but there's nothing on screen It'll keep those sections right so it looks at both audio tracks and will only remove Silences that are silent on both tracks. So yeah, so you could it works out really well Just speeds it up You don't have to go through and cut out all those quiet parts So then I can come to export and go timeline and then DaVinci resolve right here the FC PXML Hit export and I'm just gonna save that in my project directory. I can call it Whatever I want for timelines. I'm gonna call it keyframe hacks Gonna save that and that's it now. I can just close this out and that's done close out that now in DaVinci resolve here I'm just gonna import that timeline that I just made so I'm gonna right click timelines Import and then choose the first option here gonna go back to my project directory Select my file there that I just exported import and you'll get a bunch of options So if I didn't already bring in my video clips, it can do that automatically the reason I do it first is so that I can sync up my good audio and Use that and have it good to go instead of having to do it after the fact So I'm just gonna turn off automatically set project settings because I have a default settings for my projects when I open them in Resolve, they're just good to go and I also turn off automatically import source clips in the media pool cuz like I said I've already got them everything else. I just leave as it is and I hit okay Now it's gonna ask you sometimes if you have multiple bins in your project where should it look for the files that are part of the timeline I'm importing and In this case masters checked It's just gonna search all the folders and find the correct files to link everything back up So here we go. This is good. Let's close down and just organize a little here close my media pool for a second I'm gonna zoom all by using shift Z and here is The entire timeline kind of cut up without all the silences already. So that takes a big Chunk out of the process of editing everything now the one thing I do need to normally check is that the clips are In the correct tracks like they're they're all gonna be in the same track for example This first track here is clips from my C100 mark 2 And down below you could see I have the keyframe hack which is my screen recording So I always like screen recording on track 1 and then on track 2 above that I'll have you know my talking head stuff So I know these first couple I don't need and for some reason in the beginning Sometimes it'll switch these like you can see the audio for this clip is actually in track 1 instead of in track 2 Where it's supposed to be so usually I just can delete the first few clips anyway and everything after that is Generally fine. So you can see if I click on any one of them shows me which track they're in and then I like to just Relabel my tracks here just to keep everything organized. So I'll call that C100 call track 1 SF for screen flow Or you could just call it screen for audio on track 1. I'm gonna call this SF which is screen recording or screen flow, which is the program I record in and then on this track This is the MKE 600 now before I go ahead and start working through this a little more The other thing that I do is that I've already synced up my good audio right to my clip in my media pool So if I were to come here and right click on my video clip come to clip attributes In clip attributes here under audio we can see I've got my good linked channel 1 and channel 2 But when the recut program cuts it up, it doesn't know that I've got good synced audio with it So if I were to come to any one of my clips from my C100 in my timeline, right click We're gonna come down to clip attributes and when I take a look at that under the audio section We could see the linked 1 and 2 is there but by default it's set to channel 1 and channel 2 So I need to make all of these clips use the good linked audio and the fastest way to do that Zoom the entire timeline command or I'm sorry shift Z And then I'm just gonna select all of these clips I'm gonna right-click clip attributes go to the audio section here And I'm just gonna change these two to link channel one link channel two hit, okay Boom all of my good audio is synced up and now we're good to go So zoom it into the beginning of the timeline here Just another quick little tip for you when I have screen recordings It's recording the same audio that I sync up with my camera So when I export out the just the screen recording I'll usually leave audio in the beginning so I can sync it up and you know The recut program as well as resolve can see and automatically sync that stuff for me But then at some point I turn off or mute the audio from the microphone because I have two separate tracks I have a track for my good audio and I have a track for the screen recordings, right? Which is all of the audio that comes out of DaVinci Resolve. So I mute that because When I'm editing here, I want to be able to hear whatever is coming from the screen recording But I don't want to necessarily have my voice on top of it, right? So a lot of times I'll mute that stuff in Mute my voice actually in the screen recording and then in my audio recording that I export out I try to remember and I think I've forgotten this one to mute the screen recording So I have just my vocal my dialogue my talking head stuff. So just looking at this part on the screen here I think I forgot to do that because in theory right here. There should be no talking head stuff It should be only the computer audio, but whatever we'll work with it and for now we'll figure it out I can always re-export the stuff. It'll automatically sync back up and it would be fine But yeah, so just something just some little tips there. I keep in mind So in the beginning here since I do have audio on my screen recording track, which is I know is my talking head stuff I'm just gonna come in select all those open my inspector and drop the volume to zero Because I don't want to mute the track because I do want to hear the screen recording as we get into the video here So next I'm gonna do a rough cut. I'm just gonna go through and make sure I've got a good flow of the video here And I like you know what I'm saying here now I usually do a couple takes on the intro there trying to get something I like So let's just jump ahead here and let's see I'm gonna start right here because I think this might be where I started but let's say Individually resolve here. I'm nope. That's where I jump in resolve. So let's move it back So jumping in a resolve here. I'm no it's not that moving back So this hack slash tip is gonna work. All right, that's resolve to coming back here I just learned this crazy keyframe hack here in DaVinci resolve And I had no idea you could do this until I just learned it and I want to share with you guys Let's jump and resolve you got to check this out. Come on All right, that one's pretty good. Let's check the one before it just in case I just learned this crazy keyframe hack here in DaVinci resolve And I had no idea you could do this until I just learned it and I want to share with you guys Let's jump and resolve you got to check this out. All right, so I think that's the intro I want to use I'm gonna delete everything before that Let's zoom in here a little bit and see it does leave some spaces sometimes and that was because I had Talking head or something else on these tracks up here So that's why I didn't delete, you know these tracks that look like there's no audio there But I can just go ahead and delete them and I'm just gonna watch through these and pick the one that I like For me saying we're gonna jump in resolve come on. So this tip is gonna So this tip slash So these two are out this hack slash tip is gonna work with a whole host of Different types of keyframes. So what we can do and a lot of times I'm gonna watch through it at two times speed just to get all the parts that I want So jumping in a result from any edit tab and this a hack slash tip for keyframe It's not a right. I see some blank ones there now. I want my You know talking head like superimposed on top of the video and to do that. I have an effect that I use It's actually from Jake whip love his stuff there So if I come into my effects library and come down to effects, I'm gonna scroll down to whip cam I'm just gonna drop that on there and now you see that automatically puts me in a little window there and I'm gonna make a few adjustments. I'm gonna select this clip open up my inspector here Let's make that a little smaller open the inspector. I am going to effects in the controls I want to put me in the top left up over here because I know that's gonna be kind of out of the way I can make a little smaller change the pad and a little bit push it out of the way Reframe I'm good there. The other one. I like the changes in the animations I don't want it to animate in and out that's kind of built into the effect here Which is cool and all but I don't want it to go in and out I just wanted to stay the same because I want to copy this to all of my other clips So I don't have to change it for every single clip because that's a lot of work that I don't want to do So once I've got those settings and I like that I'm gonna come and close my inspector Zoom my entire timeline and select that clip commander control C to copy it and then I'm gonna select all my clips to About there and then I'm gonna option or all V Which is gonna bring up this window and allow me to paste attributes So it's gonna paste the effect across all of the the clips there. So I'm just gonna check all video attributes Hit apply done. That's it now. They all have me in that little corner You know window there and now we're back to editing to make sure we've got what I want to say here I don't like that. Let's do that again. Oh, I'm a minute, right? No, I don't know. I don't like that Let's all right a lot of times. I don't like that. So let's just delete that next clip So come on in the venture resolve here. I'm in the app. It's out now this audio tip slash hack I had no idea you could do this But let's say for example, we're gonna start with some audio as the audio guy here I want a keyframe or add some keyframes my audio here now if you've seen some of my stuff about automation That's a more advanced way of doing keyframing But for example, we open our inspector right here We started at the beginning of our clip and I come to my audio tab here I just go ahead and click a keyframe and then I play through my video clip Okay, so this is one example where I'm talking about now I had the audio going here in The screen recording as well as I when I exported out my good audio I forgot to turn off the screen recording because it's it's too jumbly So what I'm gonna do is I'll re export my good audio which will automatically just sync back up It's gonna do the same file. I'm gonna have the same file name It's gonna automatically sync back up to the good video here And then I could just lower the volume of the background music because I really want you to see how the keyframes are changing You don't necessarily need to hear it so much because I'll show that more later on so I could just pop a marker here. So I remember to come back. I'm gonna add a red marker and say re export At re export Good audio just so I remember to come back and do that. So for now, we'll just keep on moving You can just write that volume slider and it'll automatically add in all the keyframes crazy It also works with the pan right here And then that got me thinking well, hey, if it works with audio, does it work? Let's check this out. Alright delete that now. Do I want to go full frame here with myself? That's insane you could just a ride that all right So come back here. I'm gonna make a cut on my video clip then I'm gonna come up here and turn off The effect so I could just click here turn off and boom I'm back to full screen now I do have some transitions sometimes that I'll use just custom ones I made it's just a slide up and a slide down So if I wanted to use that I could you know slide back up That's insane You could just a ride that volume slider and it'll automatically add in all the keyframes crazy It also works with the pan right here And then that got me thinking well, hey crazy it all and Then I'm gonna make another cut right here because I want this part to be turned back on and I can add a slide down there They know the keyframes crazy It also works with the pan right here and then that got me thinking well All right, and that got me thinking let's make another cut and then I'm just gonna turn it off for the last section here slide back up And that got me thinking well hey if it works with audio does it work with video? Yeah, it does check this out Okay, so now where I go yeah, it does I think I just want to zoom in on my face to you know Just like make that more of a point so I actually have a zoom that I use just a basic zoom on a Talking head I even call it talking head zoom so if I bring this down and Actually have to make a new track first. We're gonna add a track Bring down my talking head zoom Bring that there And shorten it up and here's what it looks like yeah, it does check this out stretch it back out and then Come here. We're gonna make a little cut on these guys So take a look at the video portion of our clips here. I'm just gonna come back to the beginning of my time Let's jump in the inspector go to the video section now. We've got keyframes for a whole ton of stuff here Let's just start with the transform section I'm just gonna hit the top-level keyframe here and now I can play throw it back watch it in real time and make any change I want here and it's gonna automatically add in the keyframe mind-blowing right? I was like what I had no idea after all these years So let's do a little zoom here So I just changed a whole bunch of stuff there So you are gonna see here that I do need to go out and Re-export out that good audio because now we're doubling up our audio right in both tracks there I don't want that I only want it in the screen recording track. So I'll fix that later It's not a big deal. So I just changed a whole bunch of stuff up there. So I just changed Take this out a whole bunch of stuff right there using the inspector and I want to see what I added on my clip here if I click on So I just make a whole bunch of change Alright, so sometimes we're gonna redo like if I don't like what I said I'll just delete that and actually I want to add in another track here in between my talking head and my screen recording So that I can drop in an adjustment clip and further zoom in on my screen recording if I want to so I'm just gonna come to my screen Flow track here. I'm gonna say add a track and we'll just call this zooms and Then I have a screen zoom that I've already set up so I can just drop that in there and let's see where I want to put it So I just made a whole bunch of changes here So maybe I want to put this here and then in order to change Where it's zooming in I can select my adjustment clip and if I come to this guy go to fusion overlay This little X is gonna tell me exactly where it's gonna zoom into so this is actually a another Effect by Jake whip works great. I love it use it all the time So I'm gonna drag it over. Let's just put it right up over here And this is what that looks like I just made a whole bunch of changes here in the inspector and a key frame to all that stuff for me as I was making the changes in real time That's where I wanted to end so I was I have to do is drag it to the end It's automatically gonna zoom back out time so to see the changes that I may expect I can come down in my timeline Make sure your clip is sure And if I want I could just copy this if I want whoa too far dragging it all over Do that if you hold just drag in another one here and again I can just adjust it and this will help make it bigger on the screen even though already zoomed in on it in my screen recording I want it to be bigger because it's just gonna be easier for you guys to see so my time So if we click on the one on the right here the diamond that's gonna show us all the keyframes that we just made in real time And if you want to see them a little more specifically like which you know Is it zoom position whatever click on this right here? Make a little more room here and I can see there's keyframes for each one of the things that we changed if I zoom in you Can see it just made keyframes or everything Now I shorten this up because I zoomed in even more and change the framing of it on the screen recording I want to make sure I get it all in there, so it just shortened up this zoom over here So you can come in change and delete them whatever you want to do You know which ones you use and where you made the keyframes again, there's sometimes there's gonna be a little bit extra space I'm gonna just gonna cut that out so you can come in change and delete and a lot of times I'm looking at the waveforms down here just to kind of tell me where that is and then I'm gonna eyeball it You know you can even make these bigger if you want like I know okay. That's got to get cut out We don't need silence there where you made the key frames You made the key frames If you want a more detailed view you can click on this you're playing back your video Even tried it with some of the other things like if we wanted to for example do the composite mode I'm gonna hit a keyframe Oh, yeah, I did have it. It is cold here if you're anywhere in the United States In the dirt of here, mind you, I'm gonna read this one I'm not talking. You can see it writing the keyframes as I'm playing back So pretty much anything with keyframes here in the edit app You're gonna be able to do this really quick and easy and it's gonna create them for you while you play back your video And you make adjustments on the fly. All right, we have a bunch of Space here and I just could get rid of all those delete I know I tried in ending a few times So it's probably gonna be the last one that sounds the best usually is the last one So I'm gonna delete that and at this point I really don't need the screen recording so I can delete those Especially since the audio is doubled up there. I'm just gonna use my backspace key Not the delete key because I want to ripple delete I just want to delete those clips and keep everything else that's in there and I Also want to come to my video clip here and I'm gonna delete the effect and Then if I command or control C copy that select all of them and then option or all V I'll get my paste attributes again, and I can just hit apply and then that way it's deleted That effect is deleted on all of the extra clips. I don't have to go through one by one and do it like that So let's I know this this one's not good. So let's get rid of that So I like to do the the talking head zoom in here So I'm gonna drop drag one of these down and we'll just apply some of these Literally kind of where I think it would make sense or where I want to like emphasize something a little bit Literally I learned that yesterday, and I was like, how did I never know that? I never even thought to try that right so much awesome stuff here in resolve and that's why when I learned new things I'm like and actually before I even start dumping those in just want to make sure yeah I think that's the take I want to want to use because I always do multiple takes so want to make sure I get the right take in there But yeah, it's here now. So yeah, I think it's all right solve and All right, we're gonna copy this over Just to emphasize this part a little bit here Well, let me know because I'm curious if I'm the only one who didn't know that hack slash tip for Keith So I want to extend this out and this is easy to adjust this talking at keyframes if I want so I can just open the keyframes And in this case I'm just gonna delete these two because I can select them and move them or I could just delete them and then this way It'll just pop right back to you know a Zoom factor of one instead of the 1.5 for keyframes. I don't know All right, so I'm talking about the crash keyframe crash course I just put out and when I'm talking about that I want to dump in the Thumbnail right just in case people go looking for it if I could find it here Yes, I put it on my external hard drive because once I am done with projects that are on my SSD I move them to a storage external hard drive where they basically sit and rot away All right, so they don't rot but You know, yeah, they just they just sit over there. So keyframes crash course All right, here we go There we go. So I'm just gonna drag this into my YouTube folder here. Okay. I'm gonna just drag this down in a timeline Dropper on in there. Come on drop in there. It's being a little little stubborn here, huh? There we go So I don't need it that big. I'm gonna scale it down Over here transform. We'll just throw it on up over here. That looks pretty good I do like to just drop a little drop shadow on there because you know why not so Effects it's one of my favorites drop shadow boom drop that in there And what is with things not sticking today, there we go stick in there, would you all right the keyframes I do have a whole key. All right, we're gonna make that a little longer. Let's just throw a transition on there in the beginning What transition you like? What do you like out there? You know, you just pick some you just throw it in there You know, maybe you could do some man not the circles not the box way you could do a little shake Kind of like the glow. I'll use that often so Let me drop that on there What's going on here? So sometimes I don't know why things are getting a little wonky here It's not letting me drop it on there. Why I don't know. I don't know sometimes it just needs a little restart. All right, well In case that doesn't work out. We just faded your brand new to keyframes But if you're brand new to keyframes, I do have a whole key. Oh one thing I do Want to do is adjust the color of this clip because I work in a color managed workflow So a lot of times when you bring in an image or something and you're in a color managed workflow You have to set what you want the input color space to be so if I right click on this Png I come down to input color space and you can see right now It's using the Canon Cinema again cannon log But I actually want to change that because this is an image to sRGB boom and you can see it fixes up the color there for me So that is definitely better. All right, looks good. Let's see. What else we got? Frame crash course that I just put out here on YouTube is free You can head over check that out We talk about the page page page color page fair like keyframes all that kind of stuff So this is kind of another concept and way of work way to keyframes that you tucked in there that I just learned about so All right, drag this out a little here now You can check this one out, but it's here now and It's here now you can all right, so let's make a cut over here cut out this part And let's just get rid of these See ya and then cut but yeah, it's here now and If you guys found it helpful give me a little thumbs up subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and with that said I look forward to seeing you guys in the next video. Peace All right, it looks good. So we'll just make a cut here and delete the rest of it boom done fade it out base All right, that's pretty good. All right, so that is the rough edit there I'm getting close to having to jump on my class here. I got like five minutes left Still got a bunch of work to do here that you know, I want to do to get it done So I may have to pause this video and come back which will be like that for you guys So no worries on your end there, but a couple things as I get you know wrap wrap up where I'm at currently I Like to add in a little zoom I can delete the first Clip underneath there because it'll show through I don't need that I just learned this crazy keyframe hack here in DaVinci Resolve and I had no idea you could do this until I do So I like to add in maybe just a little dynamic zoom here in the beginning I just learned this crazy keyframe hack here in DaVinci Resolve and So let's go to right here. Is that my computer making that dingin while I was recording? Oh But I'm gonna turn off the screen recording when I re-export out the all the good audio So that'll take care of that so I don't have to worry about that So I'm gonna make a cut here Just select my clip and I'm gonna turn on dynamic zoom and here's what we get I just learned this crazy keyframe hack here in DaVinci Resolve and I had no idea you could do this until I just learned it And I want to share with you guys All right, and then right here. I want to add in the the head zoom so I'm gonna come back to My power pins where I have the zoom Talk head zoom drop that in and I want to share with you guys Let's jump in resolve you got to check this out come on Okay here. I'm gonna make a cut get rid of that Talking head is good. Now. I like to add a transition in here I like to use and the DaVinci Resolve logo wipe transition, which is well the logo wipe transition standard here in DaVinci Resolve The DaVinci Resolve logo you have to go grab that if you want to use that or use any image that you want It doesn't really matter. So I am going to go to my effects Transitions and we have logo wipe. I'm gonna drop that on there stretch it on out a little bit and Then on the logo itself. I'm gonna come into my inspector hit transition. I'm not gonna use the text I'm gonna use a custom logo and one of the tricky things with this is that you do need to Drag the effect in from the media pool So in order to do that, I am going to go to my media pool power bins I've got brand assets and logos and then I've got a DaVinci Resolve Square logo right here. So it's a little tricky. You got to like select the one and Sometimes it's a little walkie and the inspector, but basically you just drag your image over to the custom logo Boom it drops it in you're good to go. Here's what it looks like check this out. Come on in DaVinci All right, it's good now I'm gonna add in two more audio tracks Because I want a music track and a sound effects track And I could do templates for this stuff, but it's so quick. I you know, it's not really a big deal So sound effects. I do have some great sound effects here that I use often like this Sounds good, I'm gonna drop that in there. We're gonna lower the volume a little bit You gotta check this out come on in DaVinci Resolve here. I'm in the There we go. All right, that's good. Now. I need a little bit of music I've got tons of music already downloaded. So let's just say I want to pick some from Artlist a lot of times What I do is I'll just come in here and I don't know just kind of randomly listen to a few and see what I like I'll just scroll through pick one All right, that sounds good to me let's just drop that in there, right? I'm gonna lower the volume of that and Make sure that the start of the song comes in right at the beginning and sometimes there's a little break there So I'm gonna do that. Let's hear how it sounds like I just learned this crazy keyframe hack here in DaVinci Resolve and I So I can see my levels here Stretch it out I Just learned this crazy keyframe hack here in DaVinci Resolve and I had no idea you can do this until I just learned it And I want to share with you guys. Let's jump in resolve. You got to check this out. Come on In DaVinci Resolve here. I'm in the edit tab now. All right, so that's good So I usually like to end my music like right after the transition So what I'll do is I'll make a cut on my music track Zoom in here and then I'll just fade this out Throughout the length of the transition Kind of like that Just delete this part. Here's what that sounds like I just learned this crazy keyframe hack here in DaVinci Resolve and I had no idea you can do this until I just learned it And I want to share with you guys. Let's jump in resolve. You got to check this out. Come on in DaVinci Resolve here I'm in All right, that's pretty good now might sound like the dialogs a little low But that's because I know I'm gonna go in and apply an effect or a preset onto my dialogue So I'm gonna jump in a fair light real quick go fair light. We're gonna go preset library Bring that up. I'm gonna go track presets. I've got This one is the one I typically use many EQ dialogue You could have got the mani EQ for free a while back when I had that deal speak of which I don't tell anybody But there's a new plug-in coming up. That's gonna be free for for you guys from waves Although this video might be out after that. So hopefully you didn't miss it and you caught it So anyway, apply that preset boom that audio is good to go then I also have one for music under dialogue Boom apply that we're good to go. I'm just gonna listen to it and see how it sounds now I just learned this crazy keyframe hack here in DaVinci Resolve And I had no idea you can do this until I just learned it and I want to share with you guys Let's jump and resolve you got so now I think I can make that music just a little bit louder Because my dialogue got boosted up a bunch. So let's just move this up to me minus 21 DB Do this until I just learned it and I want to share with you guys Let's jump and resolve you got to check this out. Come on in DaVinci Resolve here I'm in the edit tab now this so that's good. You can see now my my dialogue levels around at minus 10 on the the music track I did just a little EQ to cut and carve a little space for the dialogue and I added on a stereo spread effect. So jump it back into the edit tab. What else do I have to do here? Well, I like to add a little music at the end So I'm just gonna use the same piece of music and what I typically do is I'm gonna drag that out So I get the end of the song and I'm gonna come maybe I don't know 10 seconds past the end of my talking head stuff So I'll just hold shift and use my arrow keys to go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten Look at that. I got in a pretty close spot there. So I'm gonna pull this head just a little bit Bring that in and then I usually start the music somewhere around where it goes back to just my talking head So maybe here and I'll come back just a little bit and then I'll fade it in Make a cut get rid of that part Zoom in let's just fade it up Make it a little bit quieter than we had in the beginning and here's how it goes Yeah, and you make adjustments on the fly So was your mind blown as much as my mind was blown by that? I thought that was crazy Literally, I learned that yesterday and I was like, how did I never know that? I never even thought to try that right there that I just learned about so but yeah, it's here now and If you guys found it help All right, so that's that at the end I do like to add a little subscribe I know I'm kind of cruising a little quick here because time is a little tight on my side here but let's see I want to come again to my power bins and I have overlays here, which I use all the time for all kinds of stuff I have one I could do like just this subscribe is you know kind of nice sometimes I usually use this a lot I don't know. I just been kind of liking that lately And you can you know, I can change it rotate it do you know, whatever I want I go like that Because I know it might get a little covered up. I don't know with some of the you know, end screen stuff video And I'll go like that Feed out the audio in the next video And I like to feed the audio back up at the end once I say peace in the next video Now One tip when I bring audio levels back up like songs are mastered pretty loud So when you bring them in they're up close to you know, not quite clipping but they're way up there in the red right on our meters I like to keep them around minus 10 DB same place that I put the audio so it doesn't blow away the audience's ears It doesn't get overly loud quick or anything like that And then the last step that actually there's two there's a few steps left One of the last steps here is to color grade my talking head and again, I do that really quick jump into color tab What I like to do is depending on the project like this project I know all the talking head is one clip So I'm gonna use a remote grade to do it because I can do it once and it applies to all of my clips So I'm gonna select my clip right click and Where are you right here use remote grades? I'm gonna click on that. I have a power grade already all set up I'm just gonna drag and drop that on there Usually turn off my my my vignette because when the video is small Like this if I have the vignette on it actually makes it darker And I don't like that and it's just quicker to just turn off the vignette then you know go through and do too much crazy Stuff, but I'll just double check it. I'll look at my scopes down here Make sure my highlights the highest part is not higher than the 896 like that looks pretty close I can bring the highlights up just a little bit. I mean, you know, so for my face I don't want to be over that 896 because I find for me after I render that render it out and get on YouTube It's kind of looks a little blown out So I kind of go with that the only other thing I did on here is I just made some temperature changes a little contrast a little color boost and Just adjusted the color wheels a little bit there The only other thing I did is in this last notice. I just added a little bit of sharpness here I literally come to the radius and just roll it down one to you know one click On my mouse to point four seven And then my color grading is good to go there and that's it I mean it's color grades done right? I don't do anything to the screen recording and since all of my clips are the same talking head clip Boom, I'm done. That's it. That's all I got to do for that The last step that I do is set up my mastering for my audio So I come to Fairlight again. I've got a preset for this preset library I'm gonna go to global bus preset and right here. I have mastering J. Y Select bus one apply close my inspector here Let's close this now in order to check my overall loudness to make sure I'm getting you know up to that minus 14 Loves what I do is I pop out my two effects here that I just put on my main bus one and Then I'm gonna zoom out come to the beginning of my timeline Make sure you have your automation toggled on Automation controls because then if I scroll down to the bottom You're gonna see bus one here and it's got loudness history so you may need to make your window or your Track a little bigger drag it bigger like that in order to see the loudness history because if it's too small You're not gonna see that and basically what I'm gonna do is come to my loudness area I'm gonna tell resolve. Hey, I am looking for YouTube loudness. It's gonna set it automatically for me Here's our minus 14. Loves hit reset start and then down on my Effects here on my main bus. I have this waves plug-in actually the both waves. It's called WLM plus stereo so it's basically a meter, but I can also adjust the gain a little bit It does a few other little things here and there I'm gonna go ahead hit reset on that and the way I'm gonna adjust my overall loudness is by using this stereo limiter right here So I know that generally for the threshold minus three and the output silly minus one that works out good Usually I'm good to go But I'm just gonna double check where all my loudness is falling by looking at my graph Looking at my integrated level right here as well as looking at this meter right here So let's just go ahead and play through and see where we fall I just learned this crazy keyframe hack here in DaVinci Resolve And I had no idea you could do this until I just learned it and I want to share with you guys Let's jump and resolve you got to check this out. Come on in DaVinci Resolve here I'm in the edit tab now this audio tip slash Okay, so I can tell that I am below the allowable level because I'm at minus 17 here And I can go as loud as minus 14. So again right here minus 17.5 minus 17.5 So I can see where my LUFS level or my loudness level is So I can make it louder and I'm gonna do that by dragging my threshold a little louder So let's say maybe I make this five then I'm just gonna reset everything come back to the beginning and try it again Over the volume here, so I don't blow your ears out this crazy keyframe hack here in DaVinci Resolve And I had no idea you could do this until I just learned it and I want to share with you guys Let's jump and resolve you got to check this out come on in DaVinci Resolve here I'm in the edit tab now this audio tip slash hack I had no idea you could do this But let's say for example, we're gonna start with some audio as the audio guy here I want a keyframe or add some keyframes to my audio here now if you've seen some of my stuff So I can I could leave it like this. It's pretty good I mean I usually like to go one or two DB below that minus 14. So in this case minus 16 We're at minus 15.9 so I could boost up just a little bit more maybe I don't want to go too much because I don't like to get too close to that minus 14 But that's it once you know, I'm happy with where this is at boom close close Audio is good. I'm all set there Then I'm gonna jump into the deliver page now when I go to deliver my projects here Everything's filmed and edited in 1080 and I could change the timeline to 4k But I just it it takes too long to render it out that way So what I do instead is I just have a preset where I change the 1080 to 4k in the export So I'll just pick where I want it to go and then the rest of the settings I use mp4 at h.264 I change the resolution from 1080 up to 4k use the same frame rate as a timeline I restrict my quality to 90,000 when I'm doing 4k I do a multi-passing code and then everything else I leave I don't use any of the you know upload to youtube settings or the Normalization wherever that is advanced that under advanced Yeah, I don't use any of that stuff because I just set the loudness and all that for youtube So I don't need resolve to go back and do that again. It's where I want it. I don't want them to change it So once you got everything set add to render queue It's going to get this message because the resolution is higher than what the timeline is it's fine And then that's it boom. There is my Project it's ready to render out. I got to go jump on a class now so I can learn more to venture resolve stuff But that is it in a nutshell how I edit a video like this. It's a quick easy video Obviously, I could do it even quicker when I'm not talking through all of it and just Clicking through and doing all the steps and everything so if you guys found this helpful Let me know if you have questions about any of the process. I know I ran through a quick here Drop me a comment. Let me know. I'm happy to make more of these types of videos Just showing you my process working through videos But this is generally the process I use it's pretty quick For most videos, obviously some videos take a little longer a little more in depth and all that but This is kind of how I do it in a nutshell lots of presets and things that are already done I can just drop on there so I can get things done quick and not get videos and information out to you guys So you can learn some more to venture resolve. All right with that said I look forward to seeing you guys in the next video So
