If you make or edit a podcast, this video is for you. If you make videos that have more than one person and you've got more than one microphone, this video is also for you. So a lot of times when we're recording some people, whether it's a podcast, whether it's a film, whether it's whatever it kind of video it might be, and you've got two different microphones, the microphones are going to pick up bleed. So what are we talking about when I'm talking about microphone bleed? So if somebody is using this microphone, and I'm talking into this here, but this microphone is over here for my other person on film to use, there's a good chance that when this person is not talking and I'm talking in here, this microphone is still gonna pick me up. And we wanna get rid of that in this microphone because this one should only pick up the other person. And vice versa, this one's probably gonna pick up when this person is talking. So how do we deal with that in Resolve? I've got a bunch of different ways that you can kind of handle it. Some come in the studio only version, a lot of them are right in the free version, and I've got some examples here to just show you what it sounds like when your microphones, using multiple microphones, pick up bleed from people that aren't the ones that are supposed to be being picked up by the microphone. So let's jump into the Venture Resolve. I'm gonna show you exactly what I'm talking about and show you a couple different ways that you can fix that problem. All right, let's jump into it. Jumping into Resolve here, I've got three different tracks with three different people talking. I actually used two microphones to record each person, and then I picked the best audio that I had and used that as their dialogue for this little short film that we worked on. So let me just play a little bit of it, listen to the dialogue. You might notice that it sounds like the dialogue is a little doubled up, because it kinda is, and then I'm gonna show you exactly what the mic bleed looks like and then how we can deal with it a few different ways here in the Venture Resolve. So just real quick, here's what it sounds like, and just heads up, the video's blurred out because it's kids, so just, that's why it's blurred out. So here's what it sounds like. Ah! Ah! Ah! It's your turn to tell a story, come on. Me? Yeah, tell us a passed down story, you know, from your ancestors. Fine, I'll tell you a story, but it may be a bit scary. Do you think you can handle it? All right, so let's solo our three tracks here, and where is the microphone bleed happening? So if we look at each track, we can see where the person is speaking on that particular track. For example, right here in the beginning, is the person on track one, as well as this little part right here where they say me, and then this part at the end here, is all the person from track one. But if we zoom in, you can even see it a little bit, we have audio waveforms in between the parts where our actor number one is talking, and same with track number two, this is our actor number two, they laugh, she talks right here, then in this section right here, we can see it's picking up microphone bleed from a different actor, and that's what we call microphone bleed. We can, person A is talking, but person B's microphone is also picking them up, and then when person B talks, person A's microphone also picks them up. So that is the bleed that we're seeing right here, the bleed between the two microphones. Now this is really important when it comes to podcasting, you're sitting across the table from each other, or maybe you're just even doing a little film like this where everybody's 10 feet away, but you're still getting a little bit of that bleed happening. And on track number three, same thing, that person's talking right here, we've got the microphone bleed, and that person talks again. So you've got a few different ways we can work with the microphone bleed. Now if you have studio, I would give voice isolation a shot and just see if it works. It may not because it is also a voice, so it may allow that voice to come through, but it's worth a shot usually. So if I'm gonna try that out, I'm gonna just solo my first track here. I'm gonna start about here. I'm going to select my track and turn on voice isolation, which is in my inspector, audio voice isolation. Now I don't know if this is gonna work, we're gonna set it up to about, let's say 30, give it a shot and see what it sounds like. Yeah, tell us a pass down story. You know, let me answer. It's fine, I'll tell you a story, but it may be a bit scary. Do you think you can handle it? We'll be fine, just come on. Okay, well, what? Scary, do you think you can handle it? We'll be fine, just come on. So you can see it's working a little bit there. Let's try it again, boost it up even more. But it may be a bit scary. Do you think you can handle it? We'll be fine, come on. But you can see that the voice is still coming through because it's voices, right? And that's what voice isolation is supposed to do, let the voice through, but not any of the background noise or other environmental sounds. So that's not working so good, but I would try it because it's quick and easy, turn it on, see if it works. So I'm gonna turn off voice isolation there. Now we may still use voice isolation for removing some of that background noise, which is perfectly fine. But let's talk about a few more ways that you can try and get rid of that in the free version. So let's jump over into Fairlight, musical notes at the bottom. Now on each track, one of the tools that may help you between the parts where somebody's speaking and when they're not speaking is the expander, as well as the gate. So we're gonna open those up. You can just open up the mixer right here. And in our mixer, we've got our dynamics. So I'm gonna double click our dynamics to open that up. So in this first section here, we have our expander and our gate. And what this is gonna do is drop the volume of the quieter portions of our clip. So I'm gonna go ahead and turn it on. Now the expander and the gate are very similar. You're gonna see the difference here in a second. But for the expander, whenever that volume goes below where this blue line is, which is set by our threshold right here. So whenever it goes below minus 31.9, we can tell it to drop the volume of the audio faster, right? So instead of just being at whatever volume the clip is normally at, we can say, hey, drop it down a whole lot quicker. So we can change the ratio as well as the range to tell resolve how quickly it should drop that volume down. And we're gonna see it working by looking at this column right here. So let's just try it like this. Let's see if we play through our clip here. If we can hear in between this section right here, we're just gonna loop it. So let's select our range, we go from there to there. We're gonna loop it. And in this section right here, we're listening to see is it quieter? So let me turn it off. We're gonna play through that. And then we'll turn it on, see if we notice a difference. But it may be a bit scary. Do you think you can handle it? We'll be fine. Come on. Okay. Well, once upon a time, think you can handle it? We'll be fine. Come on. Okay, so you can see what the expander is doing there, right? It's making everything that is in a DB range below, wherever our threshold is, it's making it quieter a whole lot quicker. So you've got to play with the settings a little bit to get it to sound perfect on your clips, to cut out that audio perfectly. It's gonna depend on how loud it is and, you know, the way the clips are that you have. But the expander is gonna do a good job and might be a one-click fix thing for you for your particular clips. And remember, this applies to the whole track. So you do it once and you're good to go for your whole track. Now, like the expander, we have the gate. So the gate just drops it down even quicker than the expander does and just tries to make it quieter even faster. Now here you can't adjust the ratio, but you can adjust your range if you want and you can also adjust your threshold. So let's just listen to that and see how that sounds. Now the difference between the expander and the gate is the gate closes a whole lot quicker so that any audio that's down in that quieter range is gonna get cut off quicker. That's the difference. The expander is a little less heavy-handed, I guess you could say. And the gate is like boom, gate's closed, you're not coming in. I don't wanna hear it. I don't wanna hear you, so keep it quiet. So that's kinda how the gate works. So let's try the gate. Fine, I'll tell you a story, but it may be a bit scary. Do you think you can handle it? Fine, come on. Okay, wow. So you can see the gate cuts it off a lot quicker. Now you would have to adjust some settings here to make it work perfectly and, you know, make sure that the person talking that their dialogue isn't like too choppy, right? And you can adjust that by adjusting the attack hold and release. We can play with our threshold a little bit, but you get the idea. If you use a little bit of voice isolation, maybe a little bit of the expander, combine them together, you could really be able to cut out, you know, those parts in between somebody talking and just clean up your audio a whole lot, right? Cause we don't want the bleed between the two or three or more microphones. It could work for as many microphones as you have. So those are the first few ways that I would try getting rid of the dialogue that's bleeding through into my other microphones because they're going to be the quickest and the easiest for you to try out and see if it's going to work. When those don't work, the next thing that you can do is more time consuming, but it's still something that you can do and it'll work very well. So if I'm in Fairlight, you can do this either in Fairlight or in the edit tab, it doesn't matter. I'm going to clear my in and out points there by option or alt X. So let's say this section right here, I'm going to zoom in a little bit. So I know this section right here, I don't want to hear anything. So I can use some simple keyframes to lower the volume in that area. I can hold my option or alt key at a keyframe on either side of it. And once I add four there, I can just click hold and drag it down. And now the volume of that portion right there is going to be zero. So you're not going to hear anything. But it may be a bit scary. Do you think you can handle it? Okay, well. Okay, so that can work there. We can do it that way if we want. But adding keyframes to your whole podcast or your whole video, that takes a lot of time, right? So an even quicker way that we can do that is to just make cuts, right? So we can go through our audio and if I jump back into the edit tab, because I can do all this in the edit tab, if I come to the edit tab and I want only my track that I'm currently working on to be active, right? It's up to you on how you want to do it, specifically, but this is how I would do it. So let's say I'm working on track number two here. I'm going to use my option or alt to just click on this guy, the auto track selector. So nothing else is selected because I'm going to make some cuts on my track here, but I don't want everything to be affected. I only want to work with this particular track. So I'm going to make sure the auto track selector is only on for my audio track. And same with up on your video tracks here. You want to make sure that these are off, right? So we don't affect those tracks. You can use the auto track selector where you could just lock the track. It's up to you both ways, essentially accomplish the same thing. And then what we're going to do is just come and make cuts anywhere that I don't want to hear that audio. So this way is going to be a little quicker. You can use your keyboard shortcuts. You can use your blade tool here and just come like this, boom, boom, right? And just go along like that. So you can do that for your entire timeline. And then once you do that, you've got a few options of what to do next. You can select all these clips using your command key. And then you can come to your inspector and just drop the volume to zero. You can select all these clips again, holding command, select the clips and hit delete or the backspace key so that you delete them because we don't really need them there. Or you could select these clips, drop them down to zero in your inspector and then maybe add on something like a crossfade in between them, just so where the person is talking it kind of eases in and eases out. So I can go to my effects library, audio transitions, crossfade and I can just drop them on here. And a keyboard shortcut to do that is if I just select these clips, I can hit command or control T and it'll throw it on there automatically for me. And then we can adjust those how we want, right? So we have ease in and ease out of the person that's speaking. The other way that you could do it, if I zoom in here on a clip is to grab our little sliders here, you can fade it in, fade it out. But the crossfade is essentially going to do the same thing. So you don't need to waste your time going to every single clip to do that. You could just drop a crossfade on there and you're accomplishing the same thing. So if I just jump over to my final project here, this is what I decided to do. I went through, I made cuts on each one of the tracks where that person was not speaking and I ended up with what they call like a checkerboard edit here, right? I believe that's what they call it. So you can see when person one is talking, they've got their tracks there. Person two only has the sections where they're speaking and person three only has the ones where they're speaking. So just to hear how it kind of all works together. So here's two more, you know, or a section where all three tracks are, you know, active and speaking. So here's what that sounds like. Air and fear. What happened after that? Nothing really. Many lived in fear or didn't really live at all. The devil took lives? Yeah, I mean, some people walked into the woods and never came back. So now you can see each person's dialogue is super clean. We don't have the bleed coming from one microphone to the other and just causing a muddy mess here. For this one, I thought the best way was to just cut out the parts that I don't want to hear. And I think it worked out really well. Then once I've done that, I did go through and do all my audio editing like I would normally do. EQ, dynamics, some effects, put it all together, blended in, we added some sound effects in there for fun. But taking care of that microphone bleed is a huge deal, especially if you're doing a podcast with more than one person, because that could get really annoying for somebody who's listening, hearing, you know, multiple kind of layered up dialogue because, you know, both microphones are recording, one's recording quieter, and here's this person, here's that person. One way that you can get around that, if you're doing something like a podcast, is to use a good dynamic microphone, one that really just picks up in front of the microphone. Now this is not a dynamic microphone, but if for example it was, and it was only picking up from the front of the microphone, facing me, and doing a good job of isolating around it, that's gonna help eliminate some of that bleed that you're gonna get from maybe somebody who's sitting across from you, right? If you're talking, and I'm talking in here, hopefully when you're talking, this microphone's not gonna pick it up. So microphone choice does play into that quite a bit, but you know, it depends on your situation. If you have a lav mic, they're omnidirectional a lot of times. If you have other types of microphones like the Blue Yeti here, this thing, although it can be, you know, pick up from one direction, it does pick up a lot of extra sound and stuff. So sometimes we need to use extra tools to get the job done, multiple tools, but taking care of your audio and getting rid of that microphone bleed is gonna make a huge difference in the quality of your audio. All right, so that is it for this one. I'm gonna throw this guy down here, and if you have questions on microphone bleed, how to get a better setup, anything with audio stuff, or even anything in DaVinci Resolve really, feel free to drop me a comment down below, because I'm happy to help you guys, happy to make more videos that help you out. And you know, if you wanna deep dive on some audio stuff, I do have, of course, it's called Audio Essentials, for video editors in DaVinci Resolve, gives you all the basics, everything you need to know, deep dives into EQ, and dynamics, and some fun stuff. We put together a little mini documentary, so if you're interested, links down below for that too. With that said, it was fun hanging out with you, and I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
