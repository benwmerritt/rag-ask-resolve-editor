Welcome back to another Quick Tip Tuesday, guys. Here's the problem. Sometimes when I'm in Resolve, it just won't save my project. I have auto save turned on, I've got the backups turned on, but I go to save my project or maybe close out of the program and it says, do you wanna save it? And I'm like, yeah, I wanna save it. I hit yes, but it doesn't save it and it won't save it and I don't know why. Well, I don't know why it's doing that, but I do have a fix for you. And every time I've done this, it's worked out pretty good. So let's jump into Resolve, show you this Quick Tip. Quick Tip Tuesday, let's go. All right, so in the Venture Resolve here, you've got a few ways that you can save. One, I recommend always having Live Save on so that way you don't gotta worry about it, but you can use CMD or CTRL S and that's gonna save your project and you might've seen that little window pop up real quick over here. It'll just tell you that it's saving it or you can go to File and Save Project right there. But sometimes when I leave my computer sitting for a little while and then I come back to it and I've left my project open, it won't save. It just doesn't, I don't know why it doesn't do it. So here's the workaround that I found in order to be able to save your project because you don't wanna lose anything. So first thing you need to do is come to your Project Manager down here, bring that up and we wanna enable Dynamic Project Switching because we want two projects open at one time because if you don't, it's not gonna save your original project, it's gonna open the new project and then you're gonna lose everything that you wanted to save in your original project. So to enable Dynamic Project Switching, which means we can have two projects open at one time, right click, come on down to Dynamic Project Switching and check that on. So if I just right click again, you can see now it's checked on. So now we can open two projects at once. So I'm just gonna come to another random project here, actually 10 features you should know and DaVinci Resolve. So it's gonna open that up, now my media is offline because I moved it, I'm not worried about that. But let's just say I want to save it. I'm gonna come in here and when I've opened up a second project, I've always been able to save it. So I'm gonna use Command S or Control S for you or go to the File menu. So now it's saved that, now I'm gonna go back to my other project by coming up to the top of the screen here and I can click on this little dropdown and that's gonna allow me to open up my original project or go back to my other project because we have both of them open at the same time. So click on your project up there and then once it jumps back into your project that you're trying to save, it's always worked for me to hit Command or Control S and boom, then it's gonna save. So for whatever reason, I don't know why that when Resolve sits for a little while, for me anyway, it won't save the project. And if I jump into another project and then go back to my original project, boom, it saves and I've got no problems and I don't lose any work. And even if I have Live Save on, it gets a little wacky sometimes, don't know why that is, but here's a good work around for you, guys, save your work, turn on Live Save, turn on the backups. If you don't know how, I've got videos about it. Matter of fact, I'm gonna link it right here for you. You can go check out how to work with backups here in Resolve. Make sure you don't lose any work. All right guys, that is this quick tip Tuesday thing. Thank you so much for hanging out. I look forward to seeing you guys in the next video. I'm off to edit some more, film some more because I just love making content for you guys. All right, I will see you in the next video. Peace.
