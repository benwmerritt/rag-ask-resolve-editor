You guys are here for some secrets, right? I am gonna let you guys in on some secrets on how I make my videos for YouTube here, some of the tools and assets that I use to make my videos better, to make my workflow quicker, and hopefully to engage my audience a little bit better. But honestly, there's no secrets here, guys. I'm happy to share with you guys what I do in my videos, because it's gonna help you and help you make awesome videos too. And hey, there's room for everybody out here on YouTube, right? So today, we're gonna just take a few minutes and run through some assets that I use from MotionVFX that really help add a little bit of that secret sauce there on my videos and just help them make them a little bit more interesting, a little bit better, and really just kind of help take it to that next level, because we always wanna be getting a little bit better, a little bit better, a little bit better when we're making our videos. And I'm not worried about sharing secrets with you guys. Come on, we're like family here. I wanna share with you guys what I do, what works, and what I think helps make my videos more awesome, so that your videos can be more awesome too. Today's video is sponsored by MotionVFX, and they did give me some perks for you guys, so check this out. This is pretty sweet. So you can get 10% off any order using the code Jason10 if you wanna pick up anything off of their website. But even if you're not ready to pick anything up from MotionVFX yet, they want our help, and they're gonna give you a little reward to do that. So MotionVFX wants my opinion, as well as your opinion, on what can they add to their collection that you guys might find helpful or might help take your videos to the next level, or something that maybe you just want an easy drag-and-drop solution for, and they don't already have it. So if you guys have an idea for MotionVFX, drop a comment down below, and then you wanna send an email to partners at motionvfx.com, and what that's gonna get you is 15 free credits on their website. So you can take a look at their website, and you're gonna have 15 free dollars that you can go ahead and make a purchase. And I think you could probably use that when you use the code Jason10, get a little discount there on top of your $15, just for helping out MotionVFX. So a huge thank you to MotionVFX for those two perks there for you guys out there. Let's just jump in and resolve. I've got some clips here, and I just wanna show you some of the tools that I use, and hey, maybe you'll find them helpful, maybe you'll think they're cool, and maybe you might be interested in picking something up from MotionVFX. Let's go. So jumping into resolve here, once you've got the assets installed from MotionVFX, we can jump in and I'm gonna show you where to find them. So I'm in the Edit tab right here, because that's where I like to do my work. I like the Edit tab. Now you can go ahead and open up your Effects library, which is at the top right here. Open that up, and we've got our normal categories here, but once you've installed the MotionVFX plugins, or effects, or transitions, whatever it might be, there's an installer that they come with when you purchase them. You can go ahead and go through your different categories here. For example, Video Transitions, I can click my little dropdown, and I can select MotionVFX. Now in here, there's all kinds of cool stuff in there that you can use. I've got a couple different packs of assets that I've been using, and if I click on the MotionVFX dropdown, you can see here are the different packs that I've got. I've got the M Channel Clean, M Transition Luma, M Tube or 3M Tutorial. So those are the transitions that I have. Now I've got other ones. There's titles. For example, if I click the dropdown on titles, MotionVFX, you can see there's different categories here of the packs that I have downloaded from their website. And in here, again, I could just click on titles, and if I click on titles, I can see all of them in here. If I make this even a little bit bigger here, so we could see a little bit better. There's all assets in there. There's all different styles and things. I'm going to show you some of the ones that I like, and then I use a lot here in a second. But just to show you where they are under Effects as well, we've also got some more MotionVFX, and you've got things like callouts and camera rigs and different styles and tutorial things, all kinds of stuff that I'm going to show you a few things in a minute here about. So let's just take a look at some of the ones that I like. So we're going to come to titles first, because in this scene right here, it's some guy just walking in a field, and let's say I want to throw an awesome title on there. So if I come to my titles, I can scroll down past all the normal DaVinci Resolve titles that are in there, and then it starts with the assets that I got from MotionVFX. So for example, I've got lower thirds here, and again, just like anything else, if I hover on them, I can see what they are. But let's say I want to add in a title. So here is different titles that are come with the pack, and let's say I like this one right here. So I'm just going to click on it, drag it, and drop it down into my timeline. Now, once it's in my timeline, I can easily customize it. So if I just play through it, here's the default, right? This is what it looks like. And if I wanted to easily customize it, I could just click on it, go to my inspector, and we've got all kinds of controls that we can work with as far as the effect or the title or whatever it might be as concerned. So you've got content controls. This allows me to scale it up and scale it down, move it around. You could just double click any of these to reset it if you play with it and try different things. You've got your text controls. So maybe I want to say DaVinci Resolve channel, and then I can go through and adjust anything that I want. If I need to, for example, that box now is a little small there, so I can come down to element controls, and we could just make that guy a little bit wider using box width right here. We can just drag that open a little bit. And one little bonus tip here, if it's a little too hard to be exact with like scrolling this wheel, you can just hover over the number, click, hold, and drag, and it's going to give you real exact measurements there. You can move it a lot more precisely if you want. So I love these titles. I definitely use them in some of my videos, and I think they're just a great starting point that you can then go ahead and add in your own text, your own fonts, and all that kind of stuff, and just make it look awesome. Now, taking a look at this next clip here, if somebody running through the sand, let's say maybe I want to include some social media, you know, subscribe here kind of things. Well, I've got a pack for that, and you've probably seen this one. I use this one quite often on my videos, just because I think it's kind of cool and I like it. And it's really easy to use. I can just, again, click, drag, and drop it down onto my videos. And then when I play my video, the whole thing's already there. It comes right up. It looks good. It looks cool. Now, one thing you can do, because you notice, for example, on this one, you know, maybe, you know, you can't see it so good because the image is a little bit bright, you could do something like this. Just take a drop shadow, right? Normal drop shadow built into the Venturys off, drop it on there, and you're gonna notice it actually puts it right on the text and the elements in the effect there. And I can even make it darker if I select my clip, come to the effects library, boost that shadow strength up, maybe make it not so blurry, reduce the distance a little, kind of like that. And it helps it pop out a little bit more, right? Just a real quick, easy tweak on that. And then now, boom, it pops out, right? Versus if I turn it off, it kind of blends in a little bit, but boom, with that drop shadow, you know, helps it to pop right out. And all the animation, everything is already done for you. You just gotta drop it in there. Maybe you even wanna throw in a like and subscribe here. Where's that? There we go. Like and subscribe. So if I zoom out here a little bit and then play through our clip, boom, it drops it in. Like and subscribe. There you go. It's super easy. You don't have to waste time creating things from scratch. It gives you a good starting point. If you wanna start with these and then expand on it, or you could just use them as they are for a lot of this stuff. There's a lot of great text ones here that I love. And if we look through the typography section here and you just hover over, you can see there's words and letters that do all kinds of really cool things that I just find super helpful when I have a video and I wanna kind of emphasize something or I want some cool text in there. There's a ton of great assets here for text that you can use that are quick and easy, just drag and drop. Now the other ones that I like too are these M title hype. Well, let's say I want something really cool to pop on the screen. Maybe something that looks inspiring or whatever. You can just click one of these hype titles, drop it down on your screen and all of the text is fully editable. You can change it however you want. But the basics of how it comes onto the screen and all that is already done. You don't have to waste time figuring out, animating. That's one of the things that I love is that these are just so easy to use, drag and drop and they really just help make your videos look better. And again, even with text like this, if it's not popping out enough for you, go ahead and just put a little drop shadow on there. Boom, drop it on and now it's popping out a little bit more. You can adjust that drop shadow if you need to. But I think you get the idea here. The text features that they have are really cool. I mean, there's just so many great ones here. You could use it for anything really. You get tutorial videos, you got other kind of videos you're making, you're vlogging, you are making shorts or TikToks or whatever it might be. You can use all these assets for any one of those videos and it's gonna look awesome and take you no time to do it. And here you guys thought I was some kind of DaVinci Resolve editing master or maybe you didn't think that. But I'm not, I just have a lot of great assets from companies that make sweet stuff that I can use to put in my videos and that's why I wanna share it with you guys because you guys can do the exact same thing. In the title section too, you've got awesome like background kind of things here, right? That are already set up. All you have to do is drag and drop it in and you can have a cool background, throw some text on it or a graphic or something. Real quick and real easy. You even got little YouTuber, you know, like in between transition kind of things, calls to action where you say, hey, come subscribe to my channel. It's really just that easy, right? We've got icons that you can use for YouTube or any of the other social media platforms. We have different types of texts for different types of videos. Maybe you're doing a documentary. You need kind of text to pop on the screen when somebody says something or citing sources or whatever it might be. Lots of lots of great things when it comes to text here and the assets that MotionVFX has. So let's jump down into our effects section here and just take a look at some of the things that MotionVFX offers as far as the effects packs. So one of the packs I have is a call-out pack and this just allows you to, you know, put call-outs on your screen and point things out. Maybe you're using it for a tutorial or you're trying to show something specific in a video. All these are pre-made. You can adjust where the points are and where you're calling things out. Really easy to add, you know, informational kind of text to your videos. M-camera rig, this one is really cool. This will allow you to fly around your image and stuff. Really cool, kind of looks something like this. The add-ons, there are some cool add-ons here that just give you some cool little graphics for your video. They do different things. There's boxes, there's cool little shapes and things like that. Really cool and just adds a little flair to your videos, a little something extra. Intros, this one is pretty cool because it has a whole built-in intro for you. For example, if I'm on this dirt bike clip here, guys are coming over to jump, I'm gonna grab my channel, clean intro one. I'm just gonna drop it on the clip and these ones actually go on the clip because they're in effect, so it goes on the clip itself. So if I play through my clip, zoom in here a little, here's what that looks like. Put your logo in there. It's real easy to drop it in. So that's one of them, for example. This one I use a lot here, this logo with the X, which is really cool. See that a lot around my channel. And if I drop it in there, it looks like it has both effects on there. So if I click on my clip, come to my inspector effects. Yeah, so it has both of them on there. So let's get rid of that one and we just want the one with the X. So check this out, you know, boom. There you go, easy intro or transition to another video clip, something like that. And the effect will go the whole length of your clip, but you can change that if you want. And it's as easy as just cutting your clip and then it'll only be on the smaller part of a clip. And for something like this intro here, you can come into the inspector and just make all kinds of changes. You can browse for a file if you have a logo that you want to put in there. Right now you can see it's on the text option and we have instant boost. But if I wanted to use a logo, now I can go find my logo and you can stick it in there. Just browse, pick your file, boom, there you go. It's going to drop it right in there for you. You've got your title controls. You can change the title and what it says, as well as any fonts and all your normal kind of text stuff. You can change the way the cross controls work, change the size of it, make it smaller, make it look like diamond plate. You've got options on different things you can do and how you can make it look. All of it is really easy, really simple and you can customize it however you want. Scrolling down, you got corner screens where these things are already pre-made. And we did talk about how you can make these kind of things in Fusion recently, but if you have got assets like this in DaVinci Resolve here from MotionVFX, drag and drop, just drag and drop it in. So let's say I want to do this one, boom. I'm just going to drag it in, drop it on my clip. And now you can see that video is down in the corner. It's got the YouTube logo on it because that's what this preset has. Really quick, really easy, helps you crank out those videos when you're trying to make a lot of them for YouTube here. A lot of other things for tutorials here because I have like a tutorial pack where you can show different things. It'll automatically set up a lot of stuff for you if you're making a course or you have some kind of video where you've got text on the screen and things like that. And another one that's cool here is M vertical. And M vertical will work for creating videos in a vertical format for something like TikTok, YouTube, Shorts, whatever it might be. The last category, I just want to show you a few things from our transitions, right? We all love a good transition. Everybody loves a good transition. So in my effects library here, if I look at my motion VFX transitions, and if I just come in between these two clips, we got a photographer guy here and we got a closeup of an eyeball. So let's drop some transitions on there. You can hover over these and they're going to show you what the transition looks like, just like all the other transitions here in DaVinci Resolve. And a lot of these are great, man. I love how some of them flip up, flip down. I definitely use a lot of these in my tutorials because they're a little bit different than the standard ones in Resolve. And they just look really cool. You can see as I'm scrolling through here, they do all kinds of different stuff. You've got YouTuber transitions here, right? Maybe you're going in between scenes and it's just from their M Tuber 3 pack. And there's just different things in here that really just make your job easier, right? I mean, we love editing video and it is a lot of fun to learn how to create all these things yourself. But a lot of times, as a YouTuber here, I'm trying to crank out videos and I want them to look awesome. I want to do a good job. I want to share information with you guys and get stuff out there as quick as I can. And being able to use tools like these really make my job easier and make it quicker for me to be able to get those videos out there for you guys. Because I love cranking out videos. I love helping people. And quite honestly, I wish I could get more done, but as a solo guy here that I'm filming, editing, backend stuff, business stuff, doing it all myself, it's a little challenging sometimes to continue to crank out all the videos that I want to for you guys out there. So I hope you guys found this video helpful. Just sharing some of the secrets and some of the tips and tricks that I use in order to make my videos a little bit cooler, a little bit more awesome. I hope, I hope you guys think they're awesome. But MotionVFX gives me the opportunity to use awesome assets, make my videos look good, and really be able to crank through some projects here and get them out into the world for you guys to see so I can just share some of my knowledge with you guys here in DaVinci Resolve.
