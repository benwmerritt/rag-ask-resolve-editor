What's happening guys, welcome back to another quick tip Tuesday. Hope you all had a great weekend. Today we're gonna be talking about how you can quickly set up a project here in DaVinci Resolve so that you can create YouTube shorts or maybe even want to create TikToks. You're gonna do it the same way. So what we're gonna do is create that vertical format, right? Kind of like this over here, you get a vertical video that looks like that. What's happening guys, YouTube short here or TikTok. One way easy that you can do, get some good quality is just turn your DSLR sideways. Works out great, you're gonna get some great quality or you can always just use your phone here and turn it vertical. You're gonna get the perfect size video. But if you want to learn how to get your project in DaVinci Resolve set up to make a YouTube short or a TikTok, you're gonna want to check out this video because I'm gonna show you how to do it. I'll even give you a freebie template that you can download and install, although it's easy enough to create it yourself. Alright YouTube shorts, you've seen them, TikToks, you've seen it, and let's be honest, sometimes I get wrapped up in those TikToks. It's pretty funny, right? And I'll just show you how you can drop a video in there too and some options that you have on how to scale it or get it to fit into that vertical format. Let's get into it. Alright, so when we're in Resolve here, a couple things we need to keep in mind. The aspect ratio that we want to use is a 16 by 9 ratio. So that's gonna give us basically the full screen on your phone here. It's gonna give you the full screen. So in order to do that, we want to set our timeline settings to be 1920 high by 1080 wide. So to do that, let's jump into Resolve here. I'm in the edit tab, so click on the edit tab here, and we want to create a new timeline. So if I just come into my media pool, got my media pool open right here, I'm gonna right click timelines, create new timeline. Go ahead and click on that. Now that'll bring up our window here. Let's call this YouTube short. And I'm gonna leave one video track and one audio track. So I'm gonna uncheck use project settings here because right now it's set up for a normal video that I would put on YouTube here. So we want to come over to format right here. And in timeline resolution, this is what we want to change. We will actually want this to be 1080 by 1920. So we want to switch these two numbers. So just go ahead and change it. You can just highlight it and punch it in 1080. And on this one, we can do 1920. And then your frame rate is gonna match whatever your clips are. The particular clips I have in here are 29.97. So that's fine. And then the rest of these guys, you can just leave them as it is, unless you know that you need to change them. Then go ahead and change them. And then just go ahead and hit create. Now you can see in our viewer here, this is the ratio that we need for our phone and for TikTok, whether it's YouTube shorts, TikTok, whatever it is, this is the format that we need. So then you can just drag your clip, drop it in your timeline here. Gonna zoom in. I got two little clips here. Taking a look at some new tools I got. Milwaukee tools. Come on, who uses them? Dude, these things are awesome. But let me just grab my headphones here so I can hear what's going on in this clip. Still working on this room out here. Got some drywall coming soon and we're not drywall. Yeah, drywall. We're up there. And so it's just me talking about a little renovation we're doing upstairs. Now, you notice the video doesn't fit. So how do we make a video fit for this aspect ratio? Well, one, you can film it that way, right? You can flip your camera, film it like that. Or other options that you have. You can come and zoom in your clip so I can zoom it in far enough so I don't have any, you know, borders, black borders around the top or the bottom. You could do that. But what say maybe you want to see the whole video clip, right? So if I reset this, let's say I want to keep it this way so I can see the whole thing, but I'm into making shorts or TikToks or whatever. Keep in mind, this is going to be smaller, obviously, on the screen. You can't rotate it sideways. But if you wanted to just fill the background, here's what you could do. If you come on up to your effects library, go ahead and click on that. You want to come down to open effects and filters. Go ahead and scroll down towards the bottom. And under the resolve stylized section, you have blanking fill. So you can grab this, drag it and drop it onto your clip. Now, this gives you some cool options. It's going to automatically fill the rest of the frame for you with basically a duplicate of your video clip. So you can see it looks a little wonky here. But if I click this and I come into my effects, you've got different options here. You can come into the fill extent section right here. And you've got different options. Let's say I want to zoom the timeline. Let's say looking at my source here. I don't want the edges on the side. You can keep it if you like it. But let's say I don't want that. I'm just going to reduce the crop here. And then you can see my video extends all the way across. Now, we do have a couple other options that could help this look a little bit better. So I can close up my source here. And I can come down to fill appearance. You can blur the edges if you want. You also can blur the background more or less if you want. Let's say I want to blur it a little more like that. You can also fade the background a little bit. So if I just drag up the fade amount, you see here it's fading to white. I might not want that. Let's say I want it to be darker. I can just click on the color here, change that to black, or any other color that you want. It's up to you guys. And then you can fade that background as much as you want. And let's say maybe I want to add a drop shadow in here because I think it'll just help the video kind of stand out a little bit more. Come in a drop shadow, boom, crank that strength all the way up. You can adjust the blur however you need or whatever you like. And that's pretty much it. I can just go ahead and close my inspector. So now when we play through the video here, you can see the background's filled in. It's just a repeat of the video we're already looking at. Like me, some power tools here. Who doesn't look at this? Check this out. Some Milwaukee tools here. Who doesn't love Milwaukee tools? Like I said, come on, man, these things are awesome. So again, just another example, you can either drop that blanky fill on here or in this case, maybe I'll just come to my inspector and just zoom in on this, right? Zoom in. And then as I play through the clip, all right, so we're just more zoomed in. It just depends on the kind of look that you're going for. So that is how you set up a timeline here in DaVinci Resolve to make either a YouTube short or to make a TikTok. A couple of quick tips about YouTube shorts. They can be up to 60 seconds long, but you only have 60 seconds. You only got a minute to make your video. So keep that in mind when you're making your shorts. The other thing that you can do here for a YouTube short is you can also make it a square aspect ratio. So what we did now is a 16 by nine. But let's say you wanted to use that square ratio. Well, in that case, you would just make your timeline 1080 by 1080. And taking a look at this real quick, jumping back in the resolve. If I right click timelines, new timeline, I'm going to call this YouTube short 1080 square, and I'm going to uncheck use project settings. I'm going to come over to format. And now I'm just going to change this to be 1080 by 1080. So I can change this to 1080 by 1080. Again, adjust your frame rate as you need it. Hit create. Boom. There's your square, square video for a YouTube short. And again, just drag it down, drop it in. And now look, we have the same issue here that we've got the black bars on the top and the bottom. You can go ahead and either apply the blanking fill or just select your clip and zoom in and you can do it that way. That works out just fine too. So in YouTube shorts, you can either do the full vertical if you want, or you can do a square video options up to you. Try it out. See which ones you guys like. Now, when it comes to the TikToks, you've got a few different time limits on your TikToks. So I wrote it down here just to make sure I don't forget. So we've got 15 seconds that you can make a video, 60 seconds, or up to three minutes long. So you've got options there too. Now with TikTok, as far as I know, it's just that full cell phone screen size, that 1920 by 1080 size that you're going to use to make any of your TikTok videos. Now, if you're filming on your phone, then you're fine. You're good to go. You can just film it vertical and your video is going to be all set up for you. But if you had some other footage, you want to bring it into resolve here. You want to make a video for YouTube shorts or for TikTok. This is how you would do it. And I'm actually going to save this as a preset. And I'll leave a link in the description below in case you guys don't want to create your own. You can just go ahead and grab this and I'll leave some instructions there on where to put it. But it's pretty much easy enough to create yourself if you want to do that too.
