Hey welcome welcome come on in today I am gonna share with you guys how I create cool countdowns in my videos I've done some lately top five top ten and tips and to victory's all they look a little something like this the first thing number two tip number three and they're real easy to make it's not hard I want to show you guys how to do it in case you want to use something like this in your videos a quick disclaimer I don't actually create the graphic of the number itself we're gonna use some assets that we get from motion array that's sponsored today's video we're gonna grab that ones that we like and then I'm gonna show you how you can add in sound effects a little bit of music as well as record your voice directly into DaVinci resolve how we could throw it on there create that echo and delay effect and just really make a cool little transition when you're trying to list things out in your videos so let's jump on the computer grab our assets jump into resolve and I'll show you how I create these cool countdown transitions let's go so when it comes to a lot of these cool things we want to make in DaVinci resolve here for videos you don't have to create everything from scratch and really it just takes a lot of time if you're gonna do that so what I do and what you guys should do to to save time and just to get things that are maybe even better than you could make definitely better than I can make I'm gonna jump on to motion array here the sponsor today's video and the first thing I want to do is find a cool countdown that I like that I want to use in my video so to do that I'm gonna come to the videos section here at the top and then I'm gonna go to motion graphics and then once I'm in the motion graphics section I'm just gonna search for a countdown and once I do that we're gonna get a whole bunch of cool stuff here of all kinds of different countdowns you can go from 60 seconds some of them are five seconds some of them are two seconds and you're gonna see that they all kind of just rotate through the numbers which is perfectly fine we're gonna cut that video up and we're gonna be able to use it to make our countdowns and our countdown transitions here in DaVinci Resolve so find one that you like and like this guy right here that's one of the ones we're gonna be taking a look at so it's real easy to just grab an asset that you want to use download it and we're gonna go bring it into DaVinci Resolve now the other thing you can look for while you're on motion array site here is some sound effects if you want to include any kind of sound effect or any kind of other overlay which you'll see in a minute here I included another overlay on top of the numbers just to add some more visual interest to it or you can even include a little bit of music or a little stringer kind of thing for example if I come to the audio section here and I go to sound effects and maybe I just want like a quick hit or some kind of quick little something I can search through here and find you know just a little piece of music that's maybe you know four to five seconds long or something like that so I can include that in the video it really just depends on you know how much you want to add into this cool little effect and transition that we're gonna do here so let's take a look at this first example I'm gonna play the whole thing in its entirety and then I'm gonna show you the parts and pieces of how I put it together as well as how I recorded my voice here in DaVinci Resolve and we're gonna add in the delay effect to kind of just make it sound cooler so here is the final that we came up with once it was all complete check it out working in resolve so let's jump into these 10 tips so looking in resolve here the first thing that I got is the actual number now if I want to see what my number was here I can come up in my source of you or bring it up and here's what the numbers look like there's no audio associated with it it's just the numbers counting down from 10 so I'm actually doing a list starting at one and going up so what I'm gonna do is trim each number out and I'm gonna bring that into my timeline for example you can see right here I've created in and out point so I'm gonna you know move ahead in my in my viewer here to where the one starts right right after the number two I'm gonna hit I for in point and then I'll go to the end and hit out point or hit oh for out point and I can do that for each number that I want to use in my timeline so once I've got my in and out point selected I'm gonna bring just that number down into my timeline so now you can see we've got the number in the timeline it does a cool little number one now one thing that you can do depending on how long you want this to be is you can change the speed of it so if I zoom in here I can select my clip commander control R to change or to bring up the speed controls and then I can either stretch it out to make it go slower or I can shorten it to make it go a little bit faster right just depends on how you want it to fit into your video clips so a lot of them they would take a little while for that number to you know show up on screen so I would shorten it down a little bit to make it faster but in this case I'm just gonna leave it at a hundred percent so now that we have our video set up with the number that we want to use for our countdown the next thing to do in this simple example is to record your voice now you can do it just in your camera say number one number two or tip one tip to whatever you want to say record it in your camera or a lot of times I'll just record directly into DaVinci Resolve because that's easy and then it's right there in resolve or you can record on your phone or however you record audio doesn't matter just record whatever it is that you want to say bring that in a resolve and then we're gonna start and work with it so what I did was just filmed it on the camera and if we look in resolve this is what it sounds like so I brought it in here's my clip right here and I just lined it up with the beginning of my number here's what it sounds like recorded exactly how I did without making any changes number one and that's it so the first thing you want to do set the levels for your clip do that I'm gonna come up to my mixer I'm gonna come to my track I'm just gonna watch my meter and make sure it looks all right number one and it's a little low it's about minus 15 dB so I want to boost that up a little bit I'm gonna select my clip I'm gonna actually gonna come to the inspector and I'm gonna boost this up a little bit so I'm actually just gonna reset it to zero let's see how that looks on our levels here number one all right that's around minus 10 dB minus 9 that looks good now you notice my voice is sounds normal right so what I want to do is change the pitch of it so that it sounds a little cooler a little more announcer like so to do that have your clip selected come on up into your inspector and under the fray here the pitch section you want to take the semitones and reduce that so you can do it however much you want if I did say minus 11 here's what that sounds like so that's a little too deep right it wasn't very clear so I'm gonna come back to maybe minus 6 that's kind of cool and if you want to sound like a chipmunk just push it the other way right you could do that too so I'm gonna go back to minus 6 here so that's good for correcting the pitch a little bit and just making it sound a little deeper and a little more announcer like now we need to add the delay to our audio so that way it rings out right and we hear that delay of our you know whatever we said so in this case number one number one one one one that's what we want now you've got two ways to apply delay to this audio clip you can apply it to the clip or to the entire track now we want to apply it to the entire track why because if we applied it to just the clip then that echo is gonna stop as soon as you get to the end of the clip and we want that echo to ring out after the clip is done right because I only said something for a second I want that delay to ring out and ring out so if I apply it to a track the delay will continue to ring out after the clip is complete but if I applied it to a clip it's gonna stop right at the end of that clip so in order to apply the delay we're just gonna jump into Fairlight real quick because it'll allow me some Fairlight musical notes at the bottom now on my track delay voice right here I've got my clip right here and I want to apply the effect to this track so a 6 here's my a 6 track right here I'm gonna go to my effects click on the plus we're gonna come down to delay Fairlight effects and delay so this is the delay menu here now you can adjust these settings however you want to make the delay sound however you'd like but let's just hear what it sounds like by default here without actually changing anything okay so I wanted to ring out a little more those a little quick so a couple changes we can make is I'm gonna increase the delay time a little bit maybe increase the feedback just a little change the settings a little there we go add a little more in there with the wet dry mix and let's hear how that sounds alright so that's not too bad maybe I want it to be even longer I'm gonna change the delay time even more make it a little longer and see how that sounds alright let's say I like that that's kind of cool and if you want to increase it even more you can come over to your output and just crank up that wet dry mix that's like how much of the effect are we applying on our track so you can crank that up more if you want it's up to you on it's up to you on how you want that to sound but this is the general idea of how you set up that delay so that it echoes and rings out so that's good I like that let's jump back into the edit tab so back in the edit tab here we can see I've got my number clip right here and then I've got my audio clip right here and here's what it sounds like when it's all together in this really basic example so there you go it's as easy as that just dropping in your number add in a little audio and it's a cool little transition there for your countdowns now let's say we want to make it a little bit cooler we want to add some more into it so let's move on to our example number two here's my example number two here's what it sounds like take a look is tip number one number two tip number two here so what did you notice there I added a few more things and I added a little bit of music I added in a sound effect for the transition starting and stopping and then I also had my voice in there again as well so if we move ahead here in my timeline we take a look at my clips here it's gonna change the view so you can see it a little bit better here's what we have we have the video talking head of me then we've got our number right which is gonna make our transition and then it's another talking head of me after that so I drop in my number where I want it and again I created this the same way I downloaded a countdown I think it was one through ten that I liked and then I just clipped out the number that I wanted to use with in points and out points brought it into my timeline and then I went and look for some sound effects that I wanted to add in now I thought hey I want to add in you know a little whoosh kind of noise in and out and then I also want some kind of music underneath it kind of like a like a pad you know of just ambient noise to include underneath the number that we're seeing so if I just solo my track here here's the whooshes that I included so I put those kind of where I put little transitions in between my clips here just to kind of add a little bit of an effect to it and it does help to add some transitions you know either in between your countdown clip and your your talking head in this case I do have screen recordings underneath it that I was also using in this video but it just helps the transition and kind of make it flow a little bit better if you add some transitions in there and throw them in between your clips or you can also just fade out your clips here if I zoom in a little you can see I faded these two clips out a little bit there's a lot of ways that you can do it but here's just two ideas of things you can do so then I've also got down here I have a little synth track and here's what that sounds like right so nothing fancy but just a little little pad under there that just kind of makes some cool ambient noise right and I found this on motion right just by searching their sound effects right I searched for things under five seconds or whatever it is and just went through until I found something that I liked and this is what I ended up with and then finally I have my voice I recorded myself saying number two and here's what that sounds like number number two now it has the delay on there that we already created because it's on my delay voice track and I also changed the pitch of it already so if I click on the clip here and we take a look in the inspector you can see here I use minus three semi-tones because that's what I thought sounded kind of cool and then we've got the delay that we've already set up on our track so it's gonna delay out for us maybe just want to see what that sounded like before I did any of that just drag her down to a new track here I'm gonna solo that I'm gonna reset my pitch and here's what it sounded like when I first recorded it number two and that's it that's all there is to it number two and then I edited it so I can make it sound kind of cooler in the way I wanted it to so when you put that all together here's what it looks and sounds like both the end video as well as what it looks like playing through the timeline get your resolve so that is tip number one number two tip number two here so there you go really easy to take some stock footage some stock sound effects a little pad underneath put them together make a little transition there and then record your voice and throw it underneath really quick and really easy so with the last example here I did use some different sound effects and let's just take a look at what this looks like here's the example number three with the final video rename your tracks that's tip number two tip number three you can cut so what did we do here I took it to another level what I did if we take a look on the timeline here is I had several different clips right the first clip that I had was my number right so if I come in here and go on top we've got the number right number three and again I just made in points and out points grabbed my number and brought it into the timeline and then I thought hey what else can I put on here that'll make it look I don't know jazz it up a little bit make it look a little cooler well I found this graphic of a little swirly particle thing coming in so if I show you just that here's what that looks like tip tip three so I thought that was kind of cool I'm like hey we'll throw that on top of the number and just kind of layer our effects and it's gonna look pretty cool now one thing that you should know when you're layering your effects if I come in and I select my clip you want to come into your inspector and come down to composite and you want to change the composite mode right right here right now I have it on add which means it's gonna just layer things up and allow me to see things through the effects that I have so if I change this back to normal all I'm gonna see is just this one on the top here that's all I'll see so I need to change that to add so that way I can see it on top of my numbers because anything that's black will kind of be see-through then so that's real important when you're kind of layering things up is checking the composite mode and making sure that you can see everything you know on top of another this way you don't have to do any masking or anything like that you could just layer them up now another little bonus tip here for you is that if I have my number so let's just turn off our little swirl layer on my number here and let's say I had you know it overlapped a video of me talking a little bit well in that case you also want to select that clip come up and change your composite mode to add right maybe there they're just blending together a little bit or you want that number to appear on top of you a little bit so if I come back here in our in our sample clip and I come to the beginning see right here how it starts to fade on top of me right we can see the number coming in and then we see the swirls coming in right we see how it kind of starts to fade on top of me so in order to do that I changed the composite mode to add on both those clips and then you can see my video underneath those other two clips real important that that's a key thing when you're doing overlays and and just trying to put them on top of your video I work with overlays a lot and that's how I do it you change the composite mode so now that I'm happy with the way these clips are looking one other thing I did do with this clip or these two clips is actually I slowed down the clip a little bit right the numbers in the stock footage that I got they were a little fast and I wanted to slow them down a little so if I select my clip open the retime controls as commander control are you can see I slowed it down to 30% now it's it's going slower it's taking a little more time so I can get my voice in there some little sound effects and and just make it look a little bit cooler in the way that I want now when one tip here for you is if you're slowing down some of these motion graphics one tip is you want to select your clip again come to your inspector all right the bottom retime and scaling you want to change these top two options retime process change that to optical flow and then motion estimation motion estimation little tongue twister you want to change that to one of the higher settings and that's going to help resolve create frames where there might not be any if you slow down a clip like I did here slowing it down to 30% it didn't have the frames in there it would look a little jittery if I didn't change these settings here so that is another key tip when you're speeding up or slowing down any motion graphics or things like that that you might grab from motion ray or anywhere else so big tip right there then once I had my video said I thought hey what kind of sounds can I add in that could make this sound kind of cool so again I searched motion ray just looking for things and ideas of things I thought might be kind of cool and here's the sounds that I came up with so I'm just gonna play in one at a time here for you here's the first sound that I came up with and I came up with that because those little sparks kind of flying in I was like hey that kind of sounds like a spark type thing so let's go with that the next one that I found was more of a woosh transition kind of sound and that would be because those elements are flying in the lights are flying in and then finally I added a little bit of like a pad underneath right and here's what that sounded like right and then I'd layered them up the way I thought sounded kind of cool and finally on top of that I added my voice right and here's my voice and I already corrected the pitch like I showed you earlier and the delay is already on our track so I already have that set up and here's what my voice sound like tip tip 3 and actually it sounds like the pitch wasn't on there so if I just select my two clips here I'm gonna come to pitch and my inspector right here and I'm just gonna drop my semitones now do let's see minus six again and here's what it sounds like tip tip 3 all right not too bad right you get the idea you fiddle with it you make it sound as cool as you want or however you want you're good to go so now when I start to layer these things up and if I select just these couple tracks here here's what it sound like when I say layered them up so there you go it's real quick and easy to start to layer things and just make a cool effect right and I didn't have to create anything from scratch other than recording my voice super easy right into resolve right in your camera whatever it might be but you just take those cool effects and you layer them up and that's why a lot of times for me when I'm looking at how do I create something cool or a cool transition or countdown I just got to jump on somewhere like motion right and just look through the different overlays or different assets that they have and think how can I use this to make something that's kind of cool visually appealing something that you know is gonna keep your attention or just just something that kind of looks cool honestly most of the time I'm just looking for something that looks kind of cool so that is how you create a cool graphical transition countdown type of thing here in DaVinci resolve it's real easy to go grab some stock video stock footage maybe motion graphics like we did here some sound effects and you just got to learn how to piece these things together to really make something that's kind of cool and interesting for your videos and being a part of a website like motion array is really just gonna help you speed up your workflow by allowing you to grab these different assets put them together and make really awesome things in your videos without having to do a whole lot of work you have questions definitely comment down below I'm more than happy to help you guys out and just answer any questions you might have about putting something like this together if you're interested in motion array link in the description below you can save 50 bucks on a year subscription to motion array I highly recommend them I use tons of their assets all the time in my videos a lot of overlays and graphics there's a ton of great stuff there check it out I think they have a trial you can give it a shot see if you like it but that's what I use to create a lot of these things because it's already made for you you don't have to spend tons of time creating these things from scratch or learning how to do it you just got to think about the creative end of it of how do we start to put these things together a big thank you to motion ray for sponsoring today's video guys thanks so much for watching if you use these techniques tag me in a video or drop a comment somewhere with a link to a video I want to check it out and see what you guys are creating out there because I learned from you guys just as much as you guys learned from me so with that said I look forward to seeing your videos and seeing you guys in the next one alright guys take it easy peace
