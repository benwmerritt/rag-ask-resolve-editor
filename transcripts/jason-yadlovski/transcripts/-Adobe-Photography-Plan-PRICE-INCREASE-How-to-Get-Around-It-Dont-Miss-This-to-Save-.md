The Adobe photography and lightroom plan is going up in price. Noooooooooooo! But there's a way around it, and that's why I'm making this video. Because I want you guys to save some money. Now if you're like me, I've been using the Photoshop and Lightroom photography plan here through Adobe for a long long time, pretty much since they started it. And the price has always been $9.99. And now recently Adobe announced that it's raising the price for that to $14.99 per month. and we don't want to pay more, right? So there's a way around that, and this is what you gotta do. Instead of paying monthly that $9.99, you need to pay for the full year in advance. If you decide to pay for that full year in advance, then you're gonna have the same price, $9.99, but you're gonna pay the whole year upfront. Versus if you were to continue to pay monthly, they're gonna jack that price up for you to $14.99. Check out this little article here on the Adobe website. I'll link it down below if you wanna check it out yourself. But you can see right here for the existing customers or new customers, what the current prices are and what it's gonna change to. So where the change is mostly gonna happen is on the photography plan with the 20 gig limit here, originally $9.99, and for a year it's $119. And if you pay for the year, there's no change, but if you pay monthly, it's going up to $14.99. So if you can, I recommend you lock that in for the yearly price, because if you're gonna pay monthly anyway, if you got the money, if you got the monies, pay for it upfront, it's a business expense here in the United States, and keep that $9.99 rate. So I'm glad I saw an article by Scott Kelby on Lightroom Killer Tips about this because I was like, I don't even know about this, of course, I didn't see any kind of notification, but you need to do it before January 15th. So if you're an existing customer, you pay a monthly, and you wanna keep that $9.99 rate, you have to upgrade, or not upgrade, but you have to actually go into your account to upgrade and pay yearly instead of doing it monthly, and then you're gonna keep that $9.99 rate. If you're a brand new customer for the Adobe Lightroom and Photography, make sure that you pay yearly if you can, because that's gonna give you the $9.99 rate, versus if you pay monthly, it's gonna be $14.99 if you're a new user. And then the other option there is if you have just Lightroom, I didn't even know they had just a Lightroom plan, a one terabyte Lightroom plan, I didn't even know they had that, but they do, and that's, I guess, $9.99, which why not just do the photography one where you get Photoshop Lightroom and a bunch of other stuff, but that's gonna go up from $9.99 to $11.99. So again, if you wanna save a few dollars, pay a front for the year if you can. So in order to change that, all you have to do is go log into your account on Adobe, you're gonna get a screen that looks like this right here, and you're gonna see this option right up top here, save 33% on your next 12 months by paying upfront. So you're gonna go ahead and select the option to pay annual right there, and then you can just review the change, and then it's gonna allow you to go ahead and pay for that for the year. And then you'll get a page that looks like this, you'll be able to get a refund if you've got a little bit of time left on your month. In this case, it looks like it says I'll get a $10.99 refund, and I just put in my new payment method there, paid for the year, and you can see they do charge tax on it here. I'm in New Jersey and the tax is 6.625%, so gotta pay tax on everything, right? Government wants their cut, but you can see right there 127 for the year. So now I'm caught up, I can use it as a business expense for this year, and we're good to go there. Now one other thing I do wanna mention that I don't know if this is accurate or not, but when I was looking at the different plans, I did notice one thing that I don't, I wanna look into this a little bit more, but the Adobe Express, so I use that all the time for creating thumbnails, grabbing some images and stuff like that, and with the photography Photoshop plan that I had, all of the premium stuff was always included, and once I upgraded, I noticed I now looking on the site here included is just the free plan. So if I hit on 17 more here, we can see I don't see Adobe Express free plan right here. All the premium stuff used to be included, now is that a huge deal for me? Whatever, I guess not. I wish they didn't take anything away, but I think that's just kinda what's happening there with how they're working the Adobe Express stuff. So you might wanna just look into that a little bit more if you're a big user of Adobe Express, but the other thing I didn't realize is that you get all the PDF stuff included in your plan. I didn't even know all that was included in there, but you can also see what else is included in your plan. You've got Photoshop Lightroom, Lightroom Classic, Bridge, Photoshop on the iPad for mobile, you've got Lightroom, and then you've got a bunch of stuff for PDFs, portfolios, fonts, Firefly, all that kinda stuff for what's included in that yearly plan, but I did notice they took a few things out, like on desktop I think, or maybe it was mobile, there was Adobe Rush, which I never used, it was mostly stuff I never used anyway, but if you do use some other things, it should show you, when you get to this screen right here for your plan, it should show you your current plan that you selected, right, the yearly plan, versus what was in your plan before. Now there's only a couple things different, so there's not a whole lot different, and for me, I don't think it matters, but you might wanna just double check that and look into it to make sure that you've got everything that you need with the plan that you want. And the other thing I didn't even know was that you get exclusive discounts with your Adobe program, no idea, had no idea about that, let's see what they are, explore discounts, Headspace, WeTransfer, Skillshare, Dropbox, Logitech, 25% off MX, how about that? HP Zoom StreamYard, one month free, Printful, I had no idea that you got all those discounts there with your Adobe subscription, so now I know, I could check it out if I need to use them, but anyway, just wanna make this quick PSA for you guys, I want you to save some money, I don't want you guys to have to pay more than you need to, cause I don't know about you guys, but I don't wanna pay more for subscriptions, one reason I love black magic design and DaVinci Resolve, right? Pay one price, boom, you good for life. So that's the updates from Adobe when it comes to the photography plan, which is Photoshop Lightroom and a bunch of the other stuff there, the web based stuff and whatnot that we took a quick look at there. So upgrade your plan, if you can, to that yearly plan, just trying to save you guys a few bucks there, so I already did it, did it this morning, and now letting you guys know about it. So with that said, I'm outta here, I'm gonna go make some more videos for you guys, save yourself a few dollars, upgrade to the yearly plan instead of the monthly, and with that said, I will see you in the next video, peace.
