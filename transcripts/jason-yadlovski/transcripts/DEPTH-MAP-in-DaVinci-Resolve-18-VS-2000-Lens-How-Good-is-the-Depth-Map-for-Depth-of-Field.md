Hi, what's happening guys? Here's the deal. We got the depth map effect here in DaVinci Resolve 18 and it's very cool. I mean you could do some awesome stuff with it but I was wondering how well will that work on depth of field. So I'm working on some product shots and I was wondering hey will the depth of field effect that we have in DaVinci Resolve 18 work as good as my $2,000 Canon 24-72.8 lens creating that depth of field because we all love some good bokeh, right? That shallow depth of field helps your subjects stand out. So that's what we're gonna be doing. We're gonna use these two clips. Here is the first one using the Canon 24-70 2.8 lens cost me $2,000 when I bought it. This is what it looks like when you use that 2.8 depth of field. And here's the same shot but I boosted up the aperture so we have no depth of field here. Can the depth map recreate the depth of field that we get at 2.8 with this lens? So let's jump into Resolve and see how well the depth map does at creating some shallow depth of field. See you in the studio. Alright guys we're in Resolve here. So the first clip that we looked at is this one right here. You can see I shot this on my Canon 24-72.8. We're at an aperture of f2.8 and we're getting that great depth of field there that nice bokeh in the background right we got that nice blur there. Is the depth field effect able to recreate this and if it is how well? So my next clip here that you saw this is the same clip tried to get the same angle here we're at about 35 millimeters. I think I was at about f13 or 16 somewhere in that range. So you see a lot more in focus in this particular shot. So you can see here what we want to do is isolate the wallet here the Ridge wallet and then we want to be able to blur that background a little bit more and see how close it comes to that 24-72.8. So you can use the depth map here in the edit tab but we're jumping into the color tab. If you guys want more tutorials about the depth map let me know I can make more about it and how it works and using it in the edit tab versus cut or color I mean we could do that but I'm jumping into the color tab so got my clip selected boom jumping over into color. So what I want to do first is add on the effect into my node. So I did do a little color grade on here is a little dark so brighten her up and actually just in case we're looking at something different you're not seeing the same thing you can come to workspace reset UI layout hit that and we should be looking at the same thing. So you can see once I hit that it changes it now it looks like this. So I've got my node that I added a little color grade to now I want to come to my effects which is right up here at the top of the screen click on that guy effects right there scroll down until we get to resolve FX refine and that's where you're gonna find the depth map to add it in just click on it drag it over you'll see a little plus if you hover over the line there and drop it on. So once you drop the depth map on there you're gonna see in your settings here you've got a bunch of different options there's a whole lot of stuff in there I can cover that in another video if you guys are interested in like an in-depth like what does each one of these sliders do what does it mean that kind of stuff let me know in the comments we can cover that if you're interested but for now all I want to do is come to quality and I'm gonna change it to faster because it's just gonna work better for a tutorial here and the reason being is that this effect does use a lot of you know power and resources so if you're doing a project you probably want to use better but if you were just testing things out and trying things out I think faster works out just fine. So I did close my gallery over here get a little more room on the screen but let's just take a look at our image here just so you guys know what you're looking at when you see the depth map preview here so the areas in white and gray are areas that will be affected by the blur that we're gonna apply now if you notice we do have a gradient kind in the background there so if anything is solid black that will not have the effect applied to it so in this case I don't actually want the effect to be applied to I know this is the log in the wallet here I actually want to flip that and I want it to be applied to the background to see if we can get that depth of field and match the 24-72-8 from Canon. So in order to do that just come on over to invert boom gonna invert it now I'm gonna adjust some of these just a little bit and even just by turning it on you can see it does a better job here of isolating out the wallet in the stick or the not the stick the log so you can see that the background is going to be affected because that has more of the white and the gradient to it so turning off the depth map the next thing we want to do is add in our blur so there's different ways to do it here's how I'm going to do it for now I'm going to add in another node with option or alt s and first thing I'm gonna try is just jumping on the lens blur so here's lens blur boom I'm gonna drop it on there and now you can see it's blurring everything right that's not what we wanted to do we want to use the mask from the depth map to apply the blur so in order to do that all you got to do is come over and connect out your your blue square here to the blue triangle boom and there you go so you can see here where the depth map is where it was black right we're not really affecting the log so much let me zoom in and we're not affecting the wallet too much but notice we do see a little bit of a halo going on around there around the wallet and the background blur does it look like a lens blur I mean at this point no it doesn't look like the 2470 from Canon it's it's definitely not does it help isolate the subject yeah so I'm gonna go through here and just adjust some of these settings see if we can make it look a little bit better and let's see how that looks so it just to this blur here in my opinion it's not really getting close enough to what the 2470 looks like at 22.8 I mean it's hard to replicate that outside of the camera it's best to do it in camera if you can but the downside is those lens cost a lot of money $2,000 so let's take a look at this here now we are getting a little bit of blur to the background here but let's see if we can just fix up this depth map a little bit because I don't like how this has a little halo around it so coming back to our depth map here I'm gonna try the isolation here and see if we can change that a little bit see if that'll help and even turning on the post-processing here you can kind of work with that a little bit and that's gonna help take that away a little bit as well now is it perfect is it as good as just using the lens I don't think so but but you can do things in here that will at least help make your subject stand out a little bit more so that's looking better here and if I turn off the lens blur you can see where we were before and I don't think that works so good so here's what I'm gonna do we're gonna get rid of the lens blur and we are gonna try a different blur let's try something maybe like the Gaussian blur so I'm gonna come back into my effects library and we're gonna go ahead and grab the Gaussian blur and even this I mean it gets it kind of gets cloudy right because the depth map isn't affecting everything so maybe you can make some adjustments here to the depth map to help it you know affect that background a little bit more you could always try that and in order to make those adjustments I'm gonna come back click on my depth map and maybe you want to adjust the near and far limit right so if I bring that in a little bit okay it's it's making some changes there looks okay but look at the edge here doesn't look so hot right okay so even that is not so great right I mean it's okay don't get me wrong in a pinch I might use it for something but maybe not in this kind of situation you know it's not great I would definitely go with a kind of 2472 8 at 2.8 it's gonna just give you a much better depth of field then this effect is gonna give you here in resolve but you do have other ways that you can try and do it this is just a quick way you can try and do it you can also even if we reset our node here come on down to our blur and we can just try and you know blur this and then flip our depth map back that might even work better if you just use the blur down here you know in the blur section of your adjustments that might work out pretty good too and again just coming back I mean the 2.8 it's just there's really no competition there I think you know but then again I pay $2,000 for this lens as opposed to the DaVinci Resolve that they just added the effect in so I'm sure you there's ways to tweak it and look better but the other thing I wanted to try is see how does this effect the depth map work on iPhone footage but before we get into iPhone footage want to take a quick moment to talk about our sponsor today's video the Ridge wallet yo what's happening guys today's video is sponsored by the Ridge wallet and I just want to take a second to tell you about it a little bit because I've had the Ridge wallet for a little while now and I've been loving it man this thing is great the biggest thing that I like about this and if you're like me I want something smaller in my pockets look at these guys side by side right here this is the Ridge wallet it's a whole lot smaller than my old school wallet my old school wallet boom look at that I had to open it up like that to get anything out of it well we don't need to do that anymore I'm gonna throw this guy away see you later we don't need that we're going with the Ridge wallet okay because I don't know about you guys but I'm tired carrying tons of big stuff in my pockets my big iPhone my keys my this my that all these things I just want something small to be in my pocket it holds up to 12 cards in here so I think I do have 12 cards in here also has a money strap on the back here and I only got a dollar in mind right now but what's cool is on the back of here you've got some grippies so your money's not gonna go flying out it's not gonna fall out you don't got to worry about it going anywhere it's held tight in there on the Ridge wallet and not only is this one stylish I got the carbon fiber edition here but you can get up to like 30 different styles I mean it was so hard to pick which one I wanted because there's so many cool ones and like I said my favorite part is that it's small in my pocket so the Ridge wallet will make an awesome Father's Day gift if my kids got it for me I would be loving this thing for sure so you can save 15% get one for your dad or tell your kids that you want one save 15% using the code Jason Ridge I'll leave it in the description below I'll leave a link for you as well as that coupon code Jason Ridge save yourself 15% get a Ridge wallet or better yet get your kids to get your Ridge wallet for Father's Day or your birthday if it's coming up thank you Ridge for sponsoring today's video so let's get back to resolve because I want to see how the depth map does on this guy and I actually have some iPhone footage that we're gonna try that depth map on and see how well does that do can we get some depth of field match that $2,000 lens check it out alright so a big thank you to Ridge wallet now let's check out this iPhone footage so I filmed it on my iPhone 13 here filmed it on this guy just in the regular video mode and it used cinematic or nothing like that now you do get a little bit of depth of field kind of by default here on the iPhone when you're relatively close to something I tried to frame it up the best I could to match what I got on the DSLR here and you can see the background it's a little it's a little soft but let's see how the depth map does so I'm just gonna come on down we're gonna grab the depth map drag that guy on boom drop it in we're gonna change this to faster so it works faster for us we're gonna invert it and I think we're gonna adjust our limits a little bit so the far looks good push out the near a little so we'll have our wallet as well as the stick or not to stick it's not a stick let's stick it's a log it's a log it's a piece of wood it's a piece of firewood well I got the piece of firewood there we want those to be in focus so we're gonna leave that like that now let's add in another node I'm gonna connect up my alpha channel turn off our depth map preview now just for fun let's try the lens blur on this clip see how it does drop that on there all right we need to invert our depth map there it's not too bad I feel like it's doing better than on the DSLR although the detail we had in the background here from the iPhone is not as good as the DSLR which means resolve has less work it has to do to the background here right but look we still got that halo so we'd have to make some adjustments to our depth map here and make sure that you know we're not getting all that in there because nobody wants to see that so I've been noticing to using this effect that it is tricky when you're trying to really cut out around a subject like this like you would think this would be pretty easy for the depth map to do because it's a hard edge right so you're not trying to get around with hair well I don't have any hair but but you're not trying to get like you know pieces of hair or finesse around the edge of an object I mean it's a hard edge it should be pretty straightforward and you know hey maybe it's just me maybe I'm not adjusting settings right here could be that too so let's talk about what is a better way that you might be able to do this this is kind of like a bonus and I wasn't gonna throw this in there but I'm gonna throw it in maybe it's gonna help you guys out so let's say I really wanted to isolate this subject probably what I would do is I would come in and I would go back to the edit tab I would take my iPhone clip we're working with the iPhone clip here I'm gonna duplicate it and then I'm gonna jump back into the color tab I'm gonna reset all my nodes here and what I would probably do is I would come in and use the new object selection tool in the object mask which is only available in the studio version but if you got the studio version this might be a way to do it because I would want to select the wallet as well as our piece of firewood here I'm gonna select that and what I want to do is just mask that out so I have only that and then I would just put that on top of the footage with the depth map so that way maybe we can kind of get it to look a little bit better here so if I toggle on it off my mask overlay here looks like it did a pretty good job of selecting it I'm gonna go ahead and track this forward and track this backward and let that do its thing and then we're gonna have that isolated we'll mask everything else out and then throw that depth map blur in the background and that should help out a little bit more too if you guys haven't tried out this object mask tool you really got to check it out got a video up here where I ran through a bunch of different examples as well as some of my own footage because yeah it's gonna work on real nice footage but how does it work on your footage so you want to check out that video link up there check that out alright so the track looks good jump into my clip on the bottom we're gonna dump the depth map back on here again boom hopefully it'll give us a little preview here I'm gonna add in another note after it here and we are gonna throw on some blur let's try the lens blur on here turn off our preview connect up our alpha channel there now we can see what's being highlighted and turn that off so that definitely works out better turn off our preview so now you can see that we still have that halo around there right now this is why we actually isolated the same subject in our previous clip because now I'm gonna come back to my previous clip I'm gonna add an alpha out I'm gonna connect that up because all I want is this part alright so the bonus tip on top of the bonus tip is this so the reason why we wanted to isolate this guy and track it is that now we want to make it just a little bit bigger and then it's gonna cover all the blur that we have that the depth map created here okay so here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna jump back to my other clip and there's different ways you can make this bigger I'm just gonna drop a transform note on here and we are gonna boost it up make it just a little bit bigger here and actually what I want to do is connect my alpha to the transform to the alpha out and now I'm gonna zoom it up boom just a little bit bigger so now when I come back to this one and I line up my clips properly here in the edit tab so I just moved the clip with the depth map on the bottom and then I have my isolated subject on the top now we can say it looks a lot better I might even need to make it a little bit bigger I still see a little bit of a halo in there but you get the idea right we're gonna make it just a little bit bigger so that it covers any kind of blur or halo that we might have going on there in the depth map alright guys wrapping up here does the depth of field in DaVinci resolve when you're using the depth map match the Canon 24 to 70 2.8 this is version 2 that I have here and no it's not gonna do as good a job I'll take this lens any day over trying to recreate it in software now I'm sure there's more ways you can play with this and get it to look better yeah but you know what if I have the option I'm going with the lens and I'm gonna get it right in camera because that's your best bet nine times out of ten you want to get it right in camera and not have to try and recreate or fix things in post if you don't have to it's gonna make more work for you and as you saw in this case it's just not gonna look as good now this did cost me $2,000 when I bought it and even the new Canon you know was it 28 to 70s or whatever it is the new RF lenses dude these things are expensive but the results you get are phenomenal so that is the depth map here in DaVinci resolve a huge thank you to Ridge wallet for sponsoring today's video if you are interested in one of those wallets say 15% link in the description below check that out tell you kids you wanted for fathers day or just go pick one up yourself because they're cool they're small and for me works great in my pocket so thank you guys for watching with that said I will see you guys in the next video Canon 2470 2.8 love this beast we'll see you peace
