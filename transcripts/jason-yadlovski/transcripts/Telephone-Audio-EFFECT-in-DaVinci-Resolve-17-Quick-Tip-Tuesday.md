Alright, peace. So you heard it there in the beginning guys. We're gonna talk about how to make a telephone tip for today's Quick Tip Tuesday. Let's jump in and resolve. This is real quick and easy. Check it out. I'm gonna grab my headphones here. So what I did was I created my timeline and I have all the clips that I want to have this telephone voice in their own track. So you can do this on a track level or clip level. It's up to you. Right now I'm in the Edit tab right here and I want to jump over into Fairlight. So I'm doing this on a track level. Like I said, I'm doing it on my track one right here, the phone voice. Easiest way to do it. Now there is more than one way to do it. So if you got other ways, hey that's cool too. No worries. Here's how you can do it. Come on over to your Effects Library. Come on down to Dynamics, Fairlight Effects, Multiband Compressor. And all you have to do here is turn on Band 3 and we want to just scooch that up a little bit and scooch the top one down a little bit. You can play with it for your clip. I'm gonna go with about here. Now let's hear how this track sounds. So I'm gonna come over here. I'm gonna solo just this track so that's all we hear. And here's what we got. I need you to make me one of those videos. Not bad. You know, make my voice sound like it's on the phone. Can you zoom in a little bit here? And you can play with this to make it sound a little bit different. We can drag this down, drag that up. Here's how it sounds. You know, make my voice sound like it's on the phone. Can you... Bring the highs up a little bit. You know, make my voice sound like it's on the phone. Can you do that? Now let's say you only wanted to add it to one clip. You didn't want to add it to the whole track. How do you do that? Well, you can be either in Fairlight or you can do it in the Edit tab. Now jump into the Edit tab. Show you here how we do it. Open your Effects Library. Make sure you're in your Fairlight Effects right here. Come on down and grab the Multiband Compressor. And then you can just drop that onto one clip. It's gonna pop it up and you're gonna do the exact same thing. Solo Band 3. Make any adjustments that you want. And then you're gonna have that Telephone Effect on just that one clip. Not on the entire track. So that's another way that you can do it. And that's it. That's all there is to it. That is how you make a phone voice here in DaVinci Resolve. Super easy using the Multiband Compressor. It's almost one click. Couple slides. You adjusted how you want and you're good to go. You've got a cool phone voice.
