Oh, man. Oh, guys, it's a sad day for my audio editing here in Divitru Resolve, because I hate to say it, but my headphones stop working. I've had these guys for like 20 years, and my Sony MDR V6 is the one side. It just stopped working. How am I going to edit some audio here in Divitru Resolve? It's so sad, but being that this is so sad and I can't hear my audio so good, there is a bright side to all this. I'm going to have to put these guys on the side. They've served me well for 20 years. Put them on the side. And the upside is that I was able to go out and purchase these guys, the Paradynamic DT 770s. I'm super excited to get working with these things, guys. Let's just go ahead and open it up right now, because I've been looking at these guys for years, and they've been around a long time, and those Sony's were awesome, and I think these are going to be even better. So let me just open this up, and we're going to take a quick look to see what these guys look like. I am super excited about these headphones here. Get to some awesome audio editing. What do we got here? A little opening it up. There it is. There it is. The Barrow Dynamics. Check it out. Check it out. What do we got in here? That is nice. Nice. Look at that. All right, we got a little extra of... Looks like we got a little bag in here that they came with. It's pretty sweet. Nice. All right, we got some instructions here. And look at these guys. Oh, these things look nice, man. Wow. Got our cord coiled up in there. These guys look good. I got the 80 Ohms version. They come in different versions. If you guys aren't familiar with these particular headphones, you can get them in 250 Ohms, 80 Ohms, or 32. And I'm using an audio interface here. So I decided to go with the 80 Ohms, because I wasn't sure if this one could power the 250 Ohm version. But man, I'm excited because I've been looking at these forever. Let me see if I can get the cord out of here. We're going to plug them in, and I'm just going to give you guys the first reaction of me giving these guys a try, because I've heard lots of great things about them over the years. And I'm curious to see, are they really that good? I don't know. I mean, from everything I've read, I can't even open the box. I can't even open the box. What is going on here? From everything I read, they're better than my Sony's, and those things were great compared to a lot of other headphones I've heard over the years. So we got a nice long cable here. I'm just going to leave that guy wrapped up for now, and I'm just going to plug this right into my audio interface here. Man, these are nice looking. The cool thing about these, too, is you can replace the headband, you can replace parts on it, a lot of things that you can do with it, just to maintain them, to keep them working for a long time. So let's go ahead and pop these guys on here. How's it feel? Feels good. Wow, the noise isolation of these guys is great so far. I guess I've got to take them out of this, because I need a little more slack here. They really did a good job taping this thing up. Come on. There we go. All right. All right. A little extra slack. It is a nice long cable here. It's not a, what do they call that? Not a braid, a coiled cable. Not coiled. It's just straight cable here, but I mean, plenty of space there for me putting it wherever I might need it, right? All right. So I'm just going to jump on the computer here, and let's see, is there a right and a left side? Yep, left side. Left side right here. It says left right there. So we're going to throw these on. It feels good. I mean, there's a lot of space around my ears. All right. I'm just going to jump on here, and I'm just jumping on Epidemic Sound. This video is not sponsored by anybody. I just want to hear how these guys sound. I'm going to pick the first thing here and see how it sounds. All right. We need something that gets going a little bit more than that, right? Hip hop dreamy laid back. I don't know. Let's go down the list here. Let's try this one, right? We need some. I'm looking at waveforms here. Here we go. Balls of steel. Wow. It sounds good. It sounds good. Let's try another something here. I'm just going to go to the trending stuff. High tech. Let's hear it. Wow. These guys, they sound good. I'm going to be honest. They sound like they've got more depth than my old school Sonys here, which the Sonys were awesome. These guys sound like they've got some really good depth to them. One of the other good things I heard about these is that they've got a great sound stage, right? We can make the sound sound like it's coming from all around us, right? The Sonys did a good job with that too. I thought if we're trying to throw sound effects in different areas and things like that, but these guys sound good. These guys sound good. Now, these are like studio monitor headphones, right? They're not headphones like a Beats or a Bose where you might want that bass boosted a little, the treble boosted a little so that you can hear things accentuated a little bit in the music. These are monitor headphones, reference headphones, so I can edit the audio, hear the parts crispy, crisp, lee, and clearly, and just really be able to edit audio good, right? So they don't have any boosts in your low ends and your high ends and stuff like that. So I am super excited to get working with these. Man, they're comfortable and they sound good. If you guys want to know more about these headphones, I do want to actually try putting together a video where I get different types of headphones from different manufacturers, and then we kind of talk about what is it like to edit with different kinds of headphones, and then I would edit a small sample and just show you what the edit sounds like here on YouTube using different headphones because what you listen to your audio on makes a big difference as to what the outcome is going to be, right? So what I would do is, if you have artificially boosted bass in your headphones, you might drop that bass out when you're editing your audio, and it may not sound as good as you wanted to once you listen on other devices, right? So really important here that you pair your headphones with the type of listening that you're going to be doing. So if you're editing audio, you want some kind of good monitoring type of headphones, versus if you're just listening to music and you're listening to things, maybe you want a different kind of headphones that boosts or whatever different ranges of the frequency, maybe you want a little more bass, a little more treble and clarity, whatever you want. So super excited about these barodynamic headphones, not sponsored here, guys. I'm just sharing some fun stuff, and I thought it'd be fun to make that little intro there being all upset. I am actually upset about the Sonys though because I do like those a lot. I've used them for over 20 years. They've been really a great headphone, but I've been looking at these for a long, long time too. So I'm going to get to audio editing with these guys and make some more vids for you guys because I got one coming out tomorrow. I got to finish that up, edit the audio with these. And with that said, guys, I guess I will see you in the next video, probably tomorrow if you're tuning in. So back to work here making vids for you guys. I will see you in the next video. Peace. Now, just having a little fun, man. These headphones are great. If there's any other kind of videos that you guys might be interested in when it comes to audio gear, whether it's headphones, microphones, whatever it might be, let me know because I love testing that stuff out. It's been a little while since I did some of that, you know, testing microphones and whatnot and reached out to some brands and stuff and, you know, tried some things out. So if you're interested in that, let me know. Loves me some good audio. I'll see you later, guys. Peace.
