What's happening guys? Quick Tip Tuesday. We've got an awesome quick and easy tip for you today and I can't take credit for this. I actually heard about it at Mr. Alex Tech's talk at ResolveCon 2022. Super handy and easy tip here. Let's get in resolve. You gotta check this out. Here you go. What you need to do is come into the edit tab right here. You wanna open up your effects library. So right at the top here, we have effects. Open that up and you wanna come down to your titles. Now this is only gonna work with the basic text or the basic title right here. So that's the one that you wanna use. Click drag it, bring it in your timeline. Let's highlight this guy. Open our inspector. We're gonna add a little text in here. Make it multi-line. We're gonna say DaVinci Resolve 18. Now let's say we wanted to make one of these lines of text a little bit bigger than the other. What I would normally do is have multiple clips of text where I would size one bigger. However, as I learned from Mr. Alex Tech, thanks man. If you use the basic text here, you can come into your rich text area. You can highlight the part you wanna enlarge and then just increase the size. But look at that, you can make any part of that bigger or smaller if you want. And real quick, just to adjust the line spacing, if you highlight it, you have to bring it up to the next line there a little bit. Just your line spacing. Bring it together. Dude, awesome. Game changer right there for your basic text on being able to make different sizes within a few lines. That is today's quick tip Tuesday. Super simple, helpful tip when Alex first mentioned this in his presentation, I was like, mind blown. What? So many cool little things like this in Resolve that you just gotta stumble on. All right guys, I'll look forward to seeing you in the next one. Peace.
