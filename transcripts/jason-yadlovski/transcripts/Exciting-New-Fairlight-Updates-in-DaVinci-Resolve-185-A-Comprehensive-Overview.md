## Transcript
Guys, what is happening? We are here for the DaVinci Resolve 18.5 Fairlight Update as your audio guy here in DaVinci Resolve. We're gonna take a look at the new features and tools that they added into Fairlight here. Just gonna run over some of them. We're just gonna talk about a few of them here before we jump on to resolve. But we're also gonna get into resolve. I'm gonna show you how some of these new tools, new features work and just kind of get you up to speed in the audio game here in Fairlight with the new features that got added in 18.5. There's so many awesome features across resolve as a whole. It's amazing. I love this program. Every time I jump in a menu, I'm finding something new. I mean, they just add so much stuff when they do these these updates here. It's awesome. Black magic. We love you guys, man. Keep doing what you're doing. You are making this program awesome for all of us and adding all the things that we want, we ask for and that we need to make our videos awesome. So thank you Black Magic for that. All right, let's get into a couple of things here real quick. I got some notes because there's a lot going on here in this update, right? Just a couple things we're gonna talk about in Fairlight real quick that maybe there's not necessarily something for me to show you But let's run down the list here. So the first thing that we've got here for Fairlight is support for voice isolation in the studio version because it's only available in studio for Linux. Now, I don't use Linux. I honestly don't know anything even about it. But if you do use Linux and I know some of you guys out there do because I've gotten some comments about it over time, you can now use voice isolation in Linux. Now, you can also use the dialogue leveler in Linux. Now, being that I've never even seen the Linux resolve before, I'm assuming maybe it didn't work before. But now it's gonna work for you. So if you've got Linux and you have the studio version, you're gonna be able to get your voice isolation as well as the dialogue leveler. So that's huge. So another tool that we have available to us here in Fairlight now is to be able to set a key to be able to scroll across an audio track in Fairlight. You can use a shortcut key to do that now. If you set it up, I imagine it's gonna be in keyboard preferences. I got to double check that. But pretty sure as where it should be where you can set it up to be able to scroll across. And maybe I'll show you that if we get to it here in Fairlight once we jump in to resolve. Another cool one is that track solo. So when you solo your track in Fairlight, it is gonna be retained across project sessions. So what I think that means, I could be wrong, but here's what I think it means. If you solo a bunch of tracks and you're listening and editing your audio and then hey, you got to go run out to the store grab a coffee or something, right? You close down resolve. Well, when you come back to resolve and open that project session again, you're gonna open it up and all those solos should be in there for you and still retained as you left them when you close down resolve. I think that's what that means. I could be wrong if I am wrong and you know I'm wrong. Just drop a comment down below. Let me know. We'll clarify that for everybody. In resolve 18.5 here for audio. We also got some improvements to the voice isolation. Now, I don't know specifically what change maybe some algorithm stuff on the back end, but it's just gonna give you a better result and do a better job for you when you're trying to isolate the voice there in DaVinci Resolve. So I'm not surprised that they updated the voice isolation and maybe the dialogue leveler will be updated soon as well. Being that we had a first generation, you know, run with those two tools and they're just gonna keep making them better and better and better and tweaking the algorithm or whatever it is that makes those things work. That's a little above my pay grade. I don't know how those work. I just know how to use them. Now, another thing that you guys might know about, I don't really know about this too much is just an integration with rewire. I'm not sure what that is, but if you use it, you know what it is. So now there's some better integration with that. You also have the ability to stream and spot from applications like sound miner. So I believe sound miner is like sound effects and stuff. I'm gonna have to check that out because I don't know too much about it. If you guys know about it, drop comment below. Give me some info. I'd like to check that out and just learn a little bit more about that. Another thing on the list here is that if you use your shift modifier key when you're trying to change some of the automation that you might set on your clips, you have the ability to now change it in 0.1 dB increments, right? So we always had that, I believe, with our gain line, right? That appears on our clip. You hover over that white gain line and you hold your shift key and you drag that gain line up and down. It's going to be a little more precise when you hold your shift key and it's not going to jump as far, you know, dB levels. It's not going to just fly right up, you know, up the numbers there like it would if you don't hold the shift key. So now we can have that feature in the automation controls too, so we can be a little more precise and exact with our setting of levels and things like that. Another one that might be really big and helpful for you guys if you work with Dolby Atomos is Enhanced Dolby Atomos Support here in DaVinci Resolve. Now, I don't do any Dolby Atomos stuff. I've never tried it. I don't know much about it. I know a lot of you guys do use it out there and it's something I'd like to get into in the future, so I'll look into more into that, you know, as we go on down the road here, but you do have Enhanced Support for that if you use that feature in DaVinci Resolve. So that should be helpful for you guys. So that's a few off the bat here. Now let's jump into Resolve and I actually want to show you how some of these other features work here. It's easier to get a visual on it and just understand how it kind of works a little bit and then figure out how can you use these new tools in your workflow? How can they speed things up for you? Make your audio editing better because let's be honest, right? If your audio ain't good in your video, nobody wants to watch your video. I'm sorry, that's just how it is, right? That's why we got to love audio. We got to work with audio. We got to make it sound the best we can, so people want to watch our videos here on YouTube, your films, whatever it might be. All right, let's jump into Resolve here and get into some more of these new tools and features in DaVinci Resolve 18.5. Let's go. The first tool we're going to talk about here in Fairlight is the ability to create, edit, and mix groups within Fairlight. So you can group your audio in different ways. So here's how you get there. In DaVinci Resolve, make sure you're in Fairlight. That's where we're going to be for the rest of this video here. So you want to come up to the top of your screen and look for your index. And actually, before I even do that, what I'm going to do is go to Workspace and reset my UI layout to make sure you guys are seeing the exact same thing that I'm seeing. So let's go ahead and do that if you haven't already. So now that we have our UI layout reset, we want to come up to index at the top. Go ahead and click on that and make sure you have tracks selected right here. So we always used to be able to see our tracks right here and our buses, which are still there. And a quick bonus tip, you can click and hold and drag these around and move your tracks around. If you'd like extra bonus bonus tip is that you can also do that with video tracks now in the edit tab. Really sweet. Glad we can do that. But the new feature here we're talking about is groups. So right now you can see by default I have a groups called all. So if I turn that on, I can make certain changes to the group that will affect everything within that group. For example, let's say I want to create a new group here with a couple sound effects tracks, right? There's a few ways that I can create a group. I can come and click on this little menu with a plus icon right here. That'll bring up this menu right here where I can create a new group. And I'm just going to name this sound effects group. You've got the ability to change the color of it so you can organize things a little bit. And then we've got the controls. So what is this group going to do? Like why am I grouping these tracks together, right? So you can allow the group to be affected by editing, which means cutting clips or removing clips by adjusting the fader for one track inside of that group. And all the faders will adjust accordingly. Solo, mute, arm the track to record the sends and automation. So if any of these items are checked, when you go to adjust that item, for example, the fader, if you adjust it within the group, all the faders of everything in that group, all the tracks in that group are going to change. So let's just show you what I'm talking about here. So I'm just going to check them all on for now. And if you want this to be your default setting, every time you create a group, you can go ahead and click set as default. And you can change any one of these to be however you want. So under add channels, let's say I want to pick sound effects three, seven, two, four and five, right? I'm going to use the command key to select multiple tracks there. And then I'm going to use this guy, boom, and it's going to add in those channels. So then I'm going to go ahead and hit save. So now you notice in our group section here, we have SFX groups, we have sound effects groups, which I just created. Now if I want to change any of the parameters of the group, I can click on this guy right here, it'll bring up that same menu and I can make any adjustments, I can add tracks, I can remove tracks, I can change the controls of how the group works, you can do that there if you want to, you can also delete the group right there. And we can enable or disable the group by selecting the label that's right in the front here. So right now the group is enabled. So what does this mean? What's going to happen? Well, if I come to say track seven, and I have my group enabled, and let's say I want to mute everything in the group, right? I want to mute these particular sound effects. Well, I can click mute once right here, and it's going to mute everything inside that group. Because I said if I use the mute or solo buttons or arm it to record, apply that to everything in the group, right? Now this is only going to work if you have the group turned on. For example, if my group is turned off, now I hit solo, it works just like it always did before, you're only going to get that one track that's going to either solo or mute or whatever it might be. Now if I turn the group back on, let's say I want to adjust the faders right for that particular group. So if I open up my mixer a little bit here, get that little icon, there we go drag you out. So let's say I come to my track seven, and I want to adjust the faders right just all the volume of all those particular clips. Well now I can raise them all up, lower them all down, and they're all going to move together. Now another little tip here, let's say that if I turn off the group for a second here, and I just change some of these faders, you know the position of them a little bit, I have audio three there, drop that down. If I turn the group on, and I choose any one of these faders now, and I adjust it, notice they all move relative to each other. So whatever the initial settings were, it's going to hold those settings and just move them relative to each other up or down based on how I'm how I'm, you know, adjusting the faders here. So that can come in real handy if you have a whole mix set up with a bunch of different audio tracks, and say you want to make them all a little bit louder, or all a little bit quieter, but you want to keep their relationship to each other. This is one way that you can do that. Now you might be thinking how is this different than a VCA, right? So if I scroll down in in my mixer here, you see we've got VCA's, and you can also actually see your groups here. So if I come up to my three dots here, my three dot menu, and I come down to the bottom, we have edit mix group, go ahead and check that on, scroll down a little more. Now you can see which tracks are part of this particular group that I've created. Now VCA's are very similar to groups, we're putting everything in a group. But when you've got a VCA, all that's going to allow you to do is move faders. That's all you can do. Whereas when we have this new group and edit mix or this edit mix group, I should say, we can adjust a whole bunch of other parameters. So again, if I come back to that menu, we can adjust, you know, editing the faders solo mute arm sends automation, we can adjust all that stuff. So it really depends on what are you trying to do with your tracks, what kind of flexibility do you want, as far as which type of setup might you use. Now one of the questions that I had with this new edit and mix group was, well, why wouldn't I just use a bus? I could just send all these things to a bus, right? And you could do that. And you're going to have a lot of the same functionality, you may even have a little bit more functionality. Because for example, if I'm in the group, and I make an EQ change, it doesn't change everything, right? It's only going to change that one particular track. So if you had everything sent to a bus, then you are able to use some of the effects and the dynamics and the EQ and stuff and apply that to everything as it comes into the bus. But where I think this new edit and mix group might come in handy is if you still want the ability to work together with things as a group for that certain set of functions that we have in our menu there when we set up the group, you want to be able to edit those things, but also be able to individually edit the track. I think that's where the advantage is going to be to use that edit and mix group, right? So it just kind of depends on how are you setting up your audio? What are you trying to accomplish? What type of flexibility do you want when you're working with your audio tracks? So you've got those three options now on how you can bring together audio tracks. You've got your VCAs, you've got your edit and mix groups, you've got a bus. And those are some of the ways that you can kind of group things together and start to work with your audio. Just depends on your situation, what you're trying to accomplish, the flexibility that you want, and really what's going to work best for your particular project. Now you can have multiple tracks in multiple groups. For example, let's say I've got a group of music and sound effects. I put all my sound effects tracks here. I'm just holding the command or control key to select multiple tracks here. I select all these guys. And let's say I want to put all those in its own group. Well, you can, again, come over to this little icon right here and add a group. Or I can just come over here, select the tracks I want, right click, and come on down to create group. And then I can go ahead click that. It's going to bring up my same menu I can call this, I'm going to leave it as group two right now. Actually, it's called sound effects and music. I want to be able to edit everything in it again. And I'm just going to go ahead and hit save. So now I've got two groups there, right? And you can have each track be part of different groups, if you'd like, you can make the groups active or not active, you can make the groups selected or not selected by using this menu right here. Again, turn turning the groups on and off, you've got lots of options here on how you can work with groups and tracks can be included in multiple groups, which can be handy just for, you know, organizing your tracks and figuring out how you want to edit your audio. So it could be super handy. But I think this is a really cool new feature here that if you work with a lot of audio tracks, a lot of dialogue, sound effects, things like that, it really gives you an opportunity to just organize things in a way that's going to make sense and work best for you on the project and in your particular workflow. So edit and mix groups, a really cool new feature here in Resolve 18.5. So being that we just mentioned some VCA's in here, there are some updates to VCA's if you want to use them and group them together, you can now nest a VCA inside of another VCA. Let me show you real quick. For example, I've got a couple tracks in this project right here. And in my mixer, I have my VCA's and I can click on this and just assign a track to a VCA. Now VCA is essentially a group that we put together. And we can adjust the faders for that entire group and they'll all adjust relative to each other if they're different or the same if we have them all set say at zero, for example. And once you add tracks into a VCA, you're going to see one master fader here. And you can see if I move it up and down, we could see that our faders, you know, move relative to each other. So if I change one fader, you know, a little bit now they move relative to each other still. So that's kind of how VCA's work. And they're just a way to group together tracks and be able to adjust the volume of that group of tracks and keep it relative to each other. Now what I was saying before about the new features that you can put a VCA inside of VCA, a little confusing, right? So if you click on the VCA's, you notice we only have 10 here. However, if you click on VCA assigned, look what happens, we get this huge menu of I believe there was 100 and 128 VCA's that we can assign tracks to right and different ways that we can group things together. So what the new feature is is that if I've got VCA one, right, I've already got some tracks going to it, well, I can then take those tracks and put them inside another VCA, for example, boom, now I have VCA one. So that group is part of VCA number two. So I have a group within a group. So that's a new feature here for the VCA's of being able to put a group inside a group. And it just helps you, again, be able to organize tracks. If you have a lot of them, you're working with a lot of different things, helps you stay organized and be able to, you know, maybe work with certain items at a time, just depends on your project and what you need. But it's nice to know that now we can put groups inside of groups when it comes to VCA's, if that's something that you need to do. The next new feature here in resolve 18.5 that we're going to be talking about is the new elastic wave voice handling and the pitch correction that it does on a voice when you try and slow down or speed up a clip that has a voice in it, and you've got new options in there. So let me roll this clip, it's going to show you an example of how this works, what it sounds like. And then we're going to get in and talk about it a little bit more here. So one of the new features here in Fairlight is the new elastic wave and how it can correct the pitch a little bit better than it used to, right? When we slow down the voice, like some people might want to do to me, because I talk too fast and I'm from Jersey, if we go ahead and slow it down now, this is what it sounds like when we slow it down and we use the voice feature here as part of the elastic tool here, you go voice or you go with the general setting there, the voice is going to sound a little bit better. So that's why that kind of sounds like it does a good job. And I think it could work out pretty good. And maybe I should do that to all my videos so people don't complain that I talk too fast. I'm from Jersey. Hey, what are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? All right, pretty cool though. I like that new feature here in Fairlight. So you heard the example there about how it's working. And let's talk about the elastic tool and show you the options and what got added in in 18.5 here. So looking at the screen, I've got that example you just saw in my timeline. And let's say you want to activate your elastic wave stretching or elastic wave tool. In order to do that, you're going to select your clip, you're going to right click on it. And you come down to elastic wave. Now this used to be just like a turn it on turn it off kind of thing. But now you've got more options in there for what you can do with that clip when you're using elastic wave. So you can set it to the voice or to general purpose. Now I don't know if you guys noticed with that example, but when it's set on voice and you hear me talking, it sounds pretty good, right? The difference is when I put it on general purpose, I find what I hear in there is that there's almost a little bit of distortion or a little bit of like a tinny robotic kind of sound in there, right? I think when you use the voice selection here on the voice, it just does a better job of matching the pitch of what the voice should actually sound like. So let me just choose general purpose for right now and just show you what that's going to sound like. So once I turn it on, I select general purpose. Now we can see in the top corner of my clip here, we have elastic wave. So in order to stretch out the clip, in this case, I'm going to slow it down, zoom out a little here. If I come to the end of my clip, and I hover and I get this symbol right here, all I have to do is click, hold and drag, and that's going to change the the speed of my clip and stretch it out. So if I stretch this guy out, and we listen to it, here's what it sounds like. I'm from Jersey. Hey, what are you going to do? What are you going to do? All right, pretty cool though. I like to stretch it out a little more. Now it doesn't match up with the video because I'm only grabbing the audio here. I would stretch out the video separately, but this is what it sounds like with the general option selected. So listen for that like kind of roboticy, medley, metallic, tinny kind of sound, and then we're going to change it to the voice option. And you can see how much better to that sound. So here's what we got. I'm from Jersey. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? So hopefully you guys can hear that in there. I'm going to right click, come back to elastic wave, and now we're going to choose voice. And once we've enabled it, and we've actually stretched out or sped up the clip there, you've got different options here too. You can make sure that the elastic view is on because it'll turn off if you go to do another clip or if you're done with it, it'll hold the settings, but you might not see it say elastic wave for the particular clip. And you can also clear timing points, which just shows you kind of breaks where the tool would, you know, either compress or speed up, you know, the audio there. So let's just go ahead and change this to voice right now. And you can hear how that sounds a little bit different than the general purpose. Change voice and let's play through that again. I'm from Jersey. Hey, what are you going to do? What are you going to do? Pretty cool, though. I like that new feature here. So can you hear it doesn't have that extra artifact noise? That's the word I was looking for before. It's got like extra artifacts in there. So when you use the voice option on a voice, obviously, you don't get that extra artifacting. So that does a really good job. The voice, the voice section there, because in the past, it was more like that general setting, right? It would kind of give you those artifacts in there when you stretched out the clip. So when you speed it up, it's not as noticeable as when you slow it down. When you slow it down, you hear a lot more of that artifacting. So if you need to stretch out a clip just a little bit, maybe it's a music clip, even, you know, you want to get those beats right where you want them, or you're trying to line up a voice exactly with something, you know, in the video portion of your project there. The elastic tool is really handy to kind of just stretch things out, move things around a little bit. Another time I like to use it a lot is with sound effects. You could really help kind of change, you know, a standard sound effect by stretching it out a little or slowing it down a little. And this is a great tool to use to do that with the elastic wave and the new options that they have here really make it better. And especially on voices, if you want to slow that down, does a really good job and helps keep those artifacts out of there. So elastic wave, the new features and updates included in that tool, really awesome. I like them and I think they're pretty sweet. The next thing we want to talk about here in DaVinci Resolve 18.5 is the ability to pan a bus. Checking it out here, I've got a bus that I created, a vocal bus, B2. And now we can pan them left and right, front, back, wherever we want. In the past, you weren't able to pan the buses. So if you just take a look over here in my mixer, notice on my main bus out here, you know, we don't, we don't have the ability to pan that. And typically when we added buses in the past, you couldn't pan them either. Well, now with my vocal bus right here, we do get the pan window, we can click this guy, drag it to the front, back, left, right, wherever you want it to go, center, center. You've got the ability to pan it wherever you want. So that's a nice feature to have because if I'm putting together, I don't know, a group of instruments or sound effects that I want pan to one side, instead of going through individually and panning them, I can put them in a bus, pan them to the one side, boom, you're good to go. And you can use that pan in a bus now, which is just another way that we can work with our audio and another tool that we have in our, in our pocket here to just make our audio editing a little bit easier. So it depends on your project, if you might be able to use that or not, but it's nice to have the option there to be able to pan your bus. The next cool one that we have here that works in Fairlight, Cut and the Edit tab is to select all of the clips that are under the playhead. Here's how it works in Resolve, here let's say I put my playhead right here, and I want to select all of these clips that are in a line underneath my playhead. So put your playhead wherever you want. And again, this works in Fairlight, Cut and the Edit tab. Come on up to trim. And then right here, you've got select all clips under the playhead. Hit that boom, and it's going to select everything that the playhead is touching, then you can grab it, move it and do whatever you want with it. Now there is a keyboard shortcut for it from what I read in the Resolve manual, and on a Mac, it's Shift Option V. However, that's not assigned on my version of Resolve here. I don't know why. I'm assuming I can go into keyboard customization and assign that. So on a PC, it would probably be instead of option be Shift Alt V. Should work. But like I said, in mine, that didn't work. I don't know if that's just because it's a beta thing. But that should be the shortcut once the final version comes out there. And I'm sure you can set it in keyboard customization. But for now, if you just go to trim, and then select all clips under playhead, you can even see it doesn't have anything assigned right here. It should tell me the keyboard shortcut if it was assigned. But that's how you could do it. And that makes it handy if you need to grab the clips that are under the playhead. The last Fairlight update that I've got for you here in 18.5 is something that probably most of you don't use much. And I don't either. I had to actually kind of look into it a little bit to see what it was about. And that is the ability to designate tracks or bus monitor sources in the index and tracks menu. So check this out real quick. So if I'm in Fairlight, we've got index right here, open that up. We're in the tracks section. And here I've got all of my tracks as well as any buses. In this case, I just have one bus. So if I scroll over here, you notice there's a section called monitor. And right now bus one, which is my main output is the only one that's checked on. So if I check on say a couple of these other guys here, what this is going to allow me to do is use any one of these channels or other buses as a way to monitor the audio. So if I come over to the right hand side of Fairlight here, you see it says bus one to auto. Well, when we have more than just that bus one checked on with those monitoring settings, we can click this little drop down and choose a different way to monitor our audio here. Now I've got to be honest, I don't know too much about this. For me, it's always on bus one and it's set to auto. If you have multiple buses, sometimes it might change. And that's why you might not have audio in DaVinci Resolve. For example, if I select FX, FSx2, sound FX2, and then I play through my clip here, we're only hearing sound effects to the track. And that's it, right? But if we want to hear everything, we need to have our main one out selected. And then the output is on auto here, which my default settings in resolve is to, you know, my audio interface for my headphones or my studio monitors. So you've got the ability to just monitor one particular track or bus if you want, just to help kind of keep things organized. Again, it's a different way of, you know, instead of muting tracks or doing other things, it's just another tool that you can use to kind of help isolate things and then work with them individually here in Fairlight. Guys, there you have it. Awesome new features here in Fairlight DaVinci Resolve 18.5. Again, it's still in beta. So if you're not too sure about upgrading because you like to wait until the full release is out, by all means, definitely wait, hold on it. But check out these videos that me and a lot of the other DaVinci Resolve YouTubers are putting out just to get up to speed on the new features and tools. Think about how you can use some of these things because they all help speed up our workflow and enhance the way that we can work on our projects. But if you do decide to upgrade to that beta version, back up your database, I feel like I'm going to be saying this for a while, always back up your database. So that way, if something happens, you got that backup, you're good to go. You don't lose all your projects that are in your database. And another little tip here is that when you first open DaVinci Resolve 18.5, it's not going to upgrade your database like when we go full versions, right, from 17 to 18. But it is going to ask you to upgrade your project and it is not backwards compatible. Super important that you guys know that you can't go backwards with your project. So if you open a project you're working on in 18.5, and then you're like, ah, it's a little shaky, I think I want to go back to 18.4. No way, no, you can't do that. You can't go backwards with your project once you upgrade it. That's more of a reason to make sure that you back up that database before you go ahead and upgrade to version 15. That way, if anything happens, you got that whole database from 18.4, you're good to go. You don't got to worry about anything, but make sure you back up that database with all your projects. So you're safe, better safe than sorry, right? And you're good to go. So with that said, guys, let me know what your favorite new feature is here in Fairlight. I like all of them, let's be honest. I like all of them. And now that we've got Fairlight covered, I'm going to be jumping into the rest of Resolve here and check out some of these other cool tools. I keep finding stuff in little menus here and there, a lot of awesome stuff here. So yeah, let's go back to digging into Resolve here and figure out what these cool new tools, features and all this fun stuff is here in Resolve 18. And with that said, I will see you guys in the next video real soon. All right, guys, we'll see you. Peace. Another thing that the voice isolation and dialogue leveler, well, not dialogue level. Another big one for a lot of you guys might be dope. All right, let's jump into Resolve, get in some more of these to nude. All right, let's jump into Resolve here. All right, so that should be good. Now let's just do a little wrap up here, a little wrap up. I think this setup looks pretty good. I mean, it's pretty good. I'm going to have to finish up my studio tour video, which will be good. That'll be fun because I'm in the new space now. And I kind of looks the same from your angle there for you guys. But for me, a lot more space here to move things around and all that and stuff. So it's kind of nice. Let's get to it. All right, we're starting to record on screen flow as well as on the C100 Mark II. So that's where we're recording. I feel like I got it twisted a little. Make sure you focus on my face, kid. Focus on my face. All right, we're going to check and make sure our screen flow is actually recording. Yeah, but all right, let's just check that. Good. All right, configure recording. I work recording back in a screen flow. Pan a bus. Where's the pan? What's no pan on the bus? Maybe I need a new bus. Like a new bus. There's no pan. How do you pan a bus? There's no pan there. Oh, there it says. Okay. What is that noise? Stupid water softener. I don't know how to do that. It doesn't even tell you how to do that. Select under the play head. There it is. On a Mac, it's shift option V and it's going to select everything. Nope. That's not going to work. Shift option, option shift V. No, control option V. No, shift command V. Nope, option command V. Nope. That's not working. Option shift V. That doesn't work. Option shift V. No, option V. Nope, that doesn't work.
