## Transcript
So I just watched the announcement here with DaVinci Resolve 20. There's so much good stuff in here I just want to touch on a couple of the things that are getting added in here a lot of stuff that you guys had asked for Like music remixing right AI is gonna remix the music for you when you stretch it out Kind of like some of you guys wanted from Premiere So we have a whole bunch of new AI tools here and when it comes to audio stuff, I think I'm gonna be out of a job Let's be honest here cuz AI is gonna do a lot of the work for me here. So that auto remix feature Here's what it looks like from the demonstration. I think it's gonna be a game changer for anybody who doesn't want to take the Time to cut up your music track. Here's what it looks like and what it does when adding music to a timeline It can sometimes be difficult to cut the length of a music track to the duration of a scene The AI music editor will extend or shorten the music track to a specific length based on the intuitive loops and edit points commonly found in music First select the clip and go to the inspectors audio tab under AI music editor Enter your target track length and click adjust or Select live trim and drag the audio clip to the desired location The music editor will intelligently find natural edit points in the track based on the music composition and Changes duration without using time compression expansion or altering the pitch The result will immediately be visible on the timeline with indicators showing where the track has been edited Use the version buttons to check out alternative solutions to the audio edit You can even decompose your edit and use the sections of music separately if you wish What's really cool about that music remix feature there is that it gives you different options You can just drag the clip out bring it back and then it's got four different options It looks like they're on how it's gonna do those changes for you So that's gonna save you a ton of time when you need to you know Retime your music track to fit with your video. That is a game changer You guys been asking for that for a long time and like I've been saying for a long time Just give black magic design some time and they're gonna have all the features that you want So that one is awesome and one that you guys been asking for the next great audio one here is showing the beats, right? It's just as easy as going to the menu there with a right click and choose show music beats Here's what that looks like when editing to the beat You can now right-click and select show music beats to analyze audio clips containing beat drum music and automatically place markers to indicate beats Use these as visual indicators for cut points or to drag the snap clips to the beat markers at the nearest frame Now this next one here is putting me out of a job, right? Let's be honest But hey, I love it. I love it and it's gonna make life easier for you guys And it is an AI tool that allows you to take all of your tracks in your timeline and it's gonna create a mix for you Right, it's gonna put your dialogue up front It's gonna adjust your music your sound effects and it's gonna create the mix for you. This thing is ridiculous I can't wait to give it a try. Here's what that looks like the AI audio assistant will analyze the audio tracks in your timeline to create a pro level audio mix When working on a timeline with audio elements that are not mixed or balanced Go to the timeline menu and navigate to AI tools audio assistant a Dialogue will prompt you for delivery standard and then take you through the mixing process as the audio assistant Organizes your tracks even without dialogue levels adjusts sound effects and music to the dialogue track and automatically creates a mastered final mix a Lot of our bread and butter over the years has been these National Geographic Expeditions and this time this is the perfect tool for editors who wish to simplify their audio workflow and feel more confident in their final mix So now they're like does it organize your tracks separate them out balance them Master the whole thing for you. It really does pretty much everything for you, right? So you could just hit that button boom It'll mix your video and you should be good to go So I'm really curious to get in there try it out see how that works And I'm sure there's always gonna be you know creative decisions that you might want to change some things But if you don't want to know about audio you don't want to mess with it You can just hit that button and the AI is gonna take care of it and you should end up with a good mix based on what I'm seeing here I mean what a very cool tool now the next thing here that was really cool that they mentioned is a voice training tool where it can create or Change voices for your dialogue or whatever you might have in your video. It's pretty cool. Here's how that works. Check it out Use the revolutionary AI voice convert tool to apply a pre-generated voice model to an existing voice recording Retaining its inflections pitch variation and emotion Right click a dialogue clip and choose voice convert to get started The Vince resolve comes with four pre-built voice models But you can always generate your own using sample recordings for privacy and security This voice generation and conversion is performed entirely on your local device Ensuring no unauthorized uploading and web access even in cloud based workflows this afternoon We've rigged up the pixels on the gimbal after rendering the track will play with a selected model voice this afternoon We've rigged up the pixels on the gimbal. That's great. This is the most beautiful place I've ever been No, it's a great this must be a place of event from sailing the chundering massive waves of the Drake Passage I'm sailing chundering massive waves of the Drake Passage This tool can be used to improve your own voice if recorded in a noisy environment Or for creating perfect ADR using the original actors own voice among many other applications pretty sick So if you wanted to use some you know more different kind of voice an AI voice or or a slightly different Or I think you can even take like your own voice train it and then create new parts. Maybe did I did I understand that right? Maybe not. I don't know. I'm gonna have to get in there and try it out once I download DaVinci resolve 20 here, but really cool I mean sometimes you need those tools and now it's just built right in the resolve instead of having going to like a third-party Software or something to do it. So really cool. The next awesome audio tool here is an AI Dialogue matter. So when you film in different locations different scenes You've got different ambient types of noises for your audio, right? Sometimes you've got a little more, you know echo Type reverb sound to it. Sometimes it's you know quieter and a tighter sound well with this AI tool It's gonna match your different types of clips automatically for you So you don't have to try and balance them and make them sound like they all go together The AI is gonna do it for you. It looks really cool. I'm curious to try this out and here's what that sounds like AI dialogue matter matches one piece of dialogue to another matching tone level and room ambience First select the primary reference clip Look at this bad boy more of an ambient sound. This is a master Our target clip is way drier and more intimate getting feedback from trusted partners in the clip menu choose AI tools Dialogue matter capture dialogue profile click the target clips you wish to match and choose apply dialogue profile getting feedback from Trusted partners. This is a master cloud story Use this tool to match dialogue recorded in different environments on different devices or on shoots spanning several days Another welcome update here is a keyframe tab right in the edit page for us I know people have been kind of like a little confused wish you could work with keyframes a little bit better So I think this is gonna help you be able to just use those keyframes easier See what's going on a little bit better And I think that panel is a nice welcome addition to DaVinci Resolve 20 here Now just a quick note. There's a lot of updates in the cut page that look really cool I'm honestly, I'm still not gonna use the cut page I just you might as well just use the edit page from my perspective for what I do and most of the editing that I need To do here in DaVinci Resolve So I'm gonna be using the edit page But the cut page does has a have a lot of good updates if you use the cut page You're gonna see a keyframes tab over there I believe they said and just a lot of other, you know, really great features So you definitely want to check out what's coming out in the cut page if you use it. I don't use it too much But here's what it looks like for the new keyframes tab here in the edit page The edit and cut pages now feature a dedicated keyframes palette for easier navigation and editing of keyframed parameters Switch between the keyframe curves and parameters mode to control keyframe placement animation speed and easing style Additionally, you can expose the keyframe tray at the bottom of the edit page to view all the keyframes of the currently selected clip on the timeline Another nice change is that the interface will automatically kind of adjust when you're doing vertical video It'll just make it a little bit easier for you to work and a little bit cleaner and give your your video You know, you know the most the most space that you can have there So that's a nice update too and here's what that looks like when working with vertical timelines The layouts of the cut edit and color pages will automatically be optimized for working with a vertical screen This ensures there is no wasted space in the viewer panel and reduces the need for zooming when working vertically And if you use an ultra-wide monitor dual-screen operation is now supported to give you faster access to more controls Some big updates to text here in DaVinci Resolve 20 So you have a multi text tool or clip here that you can drop in that allows you to do different kinds of text and The text plus was updated too and you can do different things with that now like do arcs and all kinds of cool stuff It'll wrap automatically things like that So that looks like it's gonna come in really handy because it's just gonna save you time So you don't have to do you know some of the things that you might want you don't have to do it like manually It can just do it for you here. So here's what some of those new text features look like Then you multi text tool allows you to add and individually format several text layers within a single interface Create a new text layer by pressing one of the layout icons point text box or circle Point behaves like a regular text asset with no boundaries Text box allows you to warp or clip large sections of text to the confines of a text box and Circle will write the text in a circular fashion Use the tabs at the top to navigate the many formatting parameters and design and animate your text exactly as you wish Finally, you can use the text list to rearrange lock or remove text layers as needed The text plus tool has also been updated to include the layouts point text box circle or path styles Meaning you can control the layout of your text graphics with greater flexibility than ever before What are those big updates in the cut tab? Which I know I said probably not gonna be using is an expanded audio mixer, right? We've got a lot more Tools for our audio there in the cut tab. We've got our faders. I'm looking at right now You can looks like you probably jump in your EQ dynamics and effects We do have a pan button there So it's essentially starting to look like the mixer that's right in the edit page in which case Why don't you just go to the edit page? But there are some good updates there to the audio controls that you have right in the cut page if you work in the cut page only and you want those audio controls now you're gonna have more Ability to be able to change some of those things right in the cut page instead of having to jump somewhere else Now this next tool is when it comes to multi cam and this is something too that I think if people have wanted for a while You may have seen it in other programs that I will not mention But this is the ability for resolve to use AI to cut up your scenes by whoever might be talking now Where might this come in handy? Podcasts prime example you've got several cameras you film multi Multi a multi clip or you film multiple angles I should say and then put it into a multi clip and resolve Well resolve can then take that multi cam clip and split it out based on who's speaking in the video So that is something I know that a lot of you guys have wanted out there You know a great AI tool that's just gonna speed up your workflow. You don't have to go through and do it all manually resolve is gonna be able to use AI to do that for you and You know you can just go back and change things make adjustments if you need to but your base edit there of the camera angles changing based on who's speaking Huge, you know improvement there using the AI for multi cam clips if you're doing something like you know a podcast or something like that So that's a big one you guys have been asking for and here's kind of what that looks like in DaVinci resolve 20 in the edit page AI multi cam smart switch can automatically switch multi cam angles based on the active speaker in a scene After you have created your multi cam clip which now supports the selection of a single reference audio track Place it on the timeline and enable multi cam mode in the source viewer Click the AI multi cam smart switch button and configure your edit preferences. There are two modes One for when you have a mic on each person and the second unique to DaVinci resolve for when you have only a mixed audio source That is common for all speakers This tool not only analyzes audio for individual speakers But can also utilize the video for lip movement to switch angles based on who is currently talking Another audio tool here lots of great audio improvements and that is recording voiceovers So if you need to record a voiceover you now have the option to do it right in the cut tab or in the edit tab You don't have to jump into fair light and you know go through and patch things It looks like they made it a whole lot easier for you if you want to do it right here in the edit tab So here is what the new voiceover looks like it looks pretty easy to use and if you need to use it I think it'll be a great tool The edit page also has a new voiceover feature Click record voiceover in the toolbar and indicate the file name audio input and destination track in the dialogue You can also use the options menu to specify additional parameters like input monitoring and adding a countdown in the viewer When ready click the microphone icon to start recording that fusion has a ton of great updates I'm not gonna play him here, but you can check out that if you're interested in fusion a lot of stuff Just went over my head. I gotta be honest. I mean fusions deep I know a little bit of fusion but not much so a lot of cool updates there that looked really awesome in their announcement So you want to check those out also a lot of updates in the color tab So if you want to jump in there and check those out you can check those out I'm not gonna cover them in detail here, but check out black magic designs video where they're just Explaining the features it looks like a lot of things got updated magic mask is one of those things that got a big update It looks like instead of having to draw your shape or you know the line you just click on it It automatically finds it using AI and finds whatever it is you want to mask It looks like it does a really good job things look like they've gotten sped up a little bit So it works a little bit quicker there, but a lot of great stuff there in the color tab in DaVinci resolve 20 here jump it Into fair light my favorite section here. We've got a lot of improvements and updates here some AI some not One of the big ones is when it comes to automation And you're gonna have some improvements there on how we can work with the automation So I'm curious to jump in there try that out But here's a little of what that looks like from the black magic design presentation The fair light page has many great new additions and feature upgrades Automation improvements now allow either global behavior or per channel automation mode switching giving you greater flexibility and speed during a mix You can now set some channels to be in snap or latch mode and others in trim or the new trim read mode all in the same pass Trim read lets you trim levels up or down without writing automation in order to try different levels before committing your changes Right click the track automation button on a channel to choose a different mode Or use the default global option to follow the designated settings in the automation toolbar Another new AI tool here when it comes to our audio is in tele cut is what they're calling it and basically It's removing the silences from your audio now You may have one long audio track like they showed in their example here and it's gonna take out those parts where there's no speaking Right, it's gonna remove the silences because sometimes those silences aren't exactly quiet You get a little background noise Maybe got here going in the background like I do now and it's gonna take out those silences So that way you don't have to worry about it now one thing I don't know if this is how it works or not I'm gonna have to try it out But if it would remove the silences and take out the video portion with it Let's say I've got a long clip right where I filmed the video and I want to remove the silences in the audio and video right because I don't need those parts does it automatically remove those I don't know I use another program called recut for that right now But if I could do that right in DaVinci Resolve that would be awesome And it seems like you've already got it to remove the audio Can I just make a cut on the video and audio clips and remove that whole piece the video and audio together and close that gap? I don't know I'm gonna have to get in there and try it out, but here's how that new tool works The new AI in tele cut provides powerful clip-based audio processing to handle tedious audio tasks in seconds The remove silence feature analyzes your audio clips for low level or silent areas and Automatically removes these sections for a cleaner audio track To find a range in the timeline right click an audio clip and choose remove silence to instantly see the detected silent sections in the clip in The dialogue window adjusts a decibel threshold and other handles as needed Use the checkbox at the bottom to add automatic fades to each edit in the filmmaking process The more fun you can make it the better your story will be Another great tool here is called checkerboard to new tracks At least that's how they described it and what it does is it takes your different speakers that might be in one track And it separates them out into their own individual tracks based on the speaker in the video Now this is important because you want to be able to edit each person's audio a little bit differently And I've always talked about separating things out by different microphones different locations different people You want to make sure that you separate that out so that way you get a good edit and you can work with each Individual actor location microphone, whatever it is Individually so this is going to do that for you separate everybody out into individual tracks Makes it real easy to just get that work done Save you the busy work of having to do that so you can get on to editing their audio and making it sound the best you can And here's what that tool looks like Checkerboard to new tracks splits a dialogue source clip to separate tracks for each speaker allowing individual mix and processing control It's an essential step for post dialogue editing and mixing just right click on a selection of clips Choose AI tools then checkerboard to new tracks The clips are analyzed and then split into individual tracks ready for mixing another audio AI tool here is the ability to create automatic ADR Qs so if you need to re-record voiceovers in your videos and you use the ADR tools there Which tells you like when to come in you can put words on the screen so you can Read what you have to say and time it correctly and all that kind of stuff The divinters off can use the AI to do that So if you need the ADR tools you do a lot of voiceovers and that kind of stuff This is a tool that's probably gonna come in pretty handy for you and here's how it works If your scene needs dialogue replacement and telecut can create an ADR list from the dialogue Select your clips in the timeline right click on AI tools then choose create ADR cues You can opt around speaker identification when working with an audio clip that features multiple speakers Then open the ADR panel to see your new Q list and update the character names in the ADR setup panel Another audio tool here is EQ matcher and level matcher so basically it's gonna take your clips and Match up their EQ so that they sound the same not so you're just copying and pasting an EQ But it's matching up the sound and the way they sound with each other So that's pretty cool when it comes to EQ matching that can save you a lot of work when you have you know You filmed in one scene and you're you make you know You made your edit you like it and then you have a different scene But it doesn't quite sound the same and you're not sure what EQ settings to make to make it match up Well, this tool will do that automatically for you and match up the sounds of those particular clips and it can even match that EQ Dynamically where it'll automate the change across your clip. So that's pretty cool. The fact that it's just doing that all for you That's that's a huge game changer. Then all you got to do is check it right and make sure it sounds good You always got to check it make sure but here's how that works and what it looks like Fairlight now includes two new clip processing options EQ matcher and level matcher both found in the main clip menu or the timelines clip operations context menu These clip operations let you adjust a target clips audio to match a reference clips level or tonal spectrum Create an EQ or a level profile from a clip and apply to another clip as a real-time process You can even EQ match dynamically So it is automated across your clip to maintain a tonal match and the results of the level matcher help you seamlessly Intercut clip sections another great tool is the ability to create custom effects chains So a lot of times when it comes to using your audio effects there You want to make a chain of you know various plugins now we can always that we've always been able to add in I think it's six Plugins in a row But now it looks like they have a effect where you can build the chain And then you can probably save that as a preset that chain and then I'm sure that chain goes into Your mixer as like one effect, right? So that way you've got more room for additional effects if you need to so really cool feature I like that now there's bunch of third-party You know plugins that I use that do the same thing that have those kind of features where it creates the chain for you Or allows you to build a chain and then you can save that chain so you could just you know use it whenever And it ends up taking up like one slot in your you know effects list of stuff that you can do So here's what that looks like really cool tool excited to use that So now it was time you can now create custom effects chains with your favorite plugins and operations with a new chain effects plugin Add up to six effects in a chain customize settings and save the preset You can even combine chain effects plugins for longer chains in the chain effect slots Another one that I think is a welcome change is the EQ in the inspector So if you want to adjust some of your clips EQ using the inspector now that inspector EQ has six bands instead of four you still only have four and I was you know, but four is okay, but six is better right? So if you want to just use that EQ that's in the inspector there now It's a six band EQ just like it is in the Fairlight page So that's a welcome improvement and here's what that looks like over in the inspector You'll find the improved clip EQ with six bands on the cut edit and Fairlight pages This allows for more tonal control at the clip level and matches the track EQ in the mixer So now you can easily copy and paste settings between the clip track and EQ plug-in for more consistent flexible and precise control a Couple more cool things here in to vitriZomb 20 I there's a ton of more stuff and I'm sure there's a lot of stuff They didn't even mention but one of the cool things here is the AI set extender So if you need to make your your frame a little bit bigger you want to add something into it There's AI that's gonna do that for you and here's what that looks like really cool. Check it out The AI set extender generates new visual content in a scene based on a simple text prompt This generative process will automatically fill in missing regions of a frame creating a finished environment in shots with blanking cropping and limited angles You can also indicate a custom region to create a new background behind a selected foreground object The AI set extender will be a black magic cloud service with details to be made available later this year And one final thing that got added here in the DaVinci Resolve 20 that I just want to highlight and mention is the ability to have Cache files automatically delete after a certain amount of time I've made videos about this and and I've cleared out, you know 90 gigs of cache files that just build up over time and some of you guys have had hundreds of gigs of cache files Build up over time and then you had to delete that and like if you don't realize you have to delete that stuff It just will clog up your hard drive in no time So there's a new option here where you can turn it on and the cache files will automatically get deleted after whatever you set it for Here's what that looks like In the preferences the new cache management section allows you to automate the handling of old cached files and to configure audio and source clips as Multi-mono upon import. So there you go a bunch of these awesome updates here in DaVinci Resolve 20 I'm super excited to get in there play with these things make some videos for you guys and just see what it's all about Right even though it's in beta now So if you're in the middle of a project you probably want to wait make sure you back up your database All those normal things that I always tell you make sure you you're you're ready to upgrade when you decide to now I don't know when the official release is gonna be up all I did was see the stream like you guys I get no insider information But black magic if you want to well give me some insider info that'd be great But not necessary so I don't know any more than you guys know but I can tell you I will be backing up my database download and DaVinci Resolve 20 and just jumping right in there and trying it out because that's part Of my job right I got to try these things out and share with you guys So you know what to expect once the version goes live and then you want to download it and use it too So without fail black magic design has done an awesome job here. It sounds like resolve 20 is gonna be Really just an awesome awesome program. I mean what have they not put out an awesome update, right? I feel like we just got 19 Right, I feel like I'm not even all the way done learning resolve 19 yet. We're already coming up on version 20 Well, she's these guys move fast, you know, I'm gonna go download DaVinci Resolve 20 here Check it out, but this was a little preview the clips I did use were from the black magic design live So I hope that's okay black magic if not, let me know alright with that said I'm out of here Go and play with DaVinci Resolve 20 find it and I will see you in the next video You
