DaVinci Resolve 20 just released some new AI audio tools like the AI EQ Matcher, the AI Level Matcher, and the AI Dialog Matcher. And on paper, these sound amazing. But the big question is, are they any good? Or are they just another AI gimmick that you're gonna try once and then you're never gonna use it again? In this video, I'm gonna show you each one of those tools in action on a little scene that I filmed. And we're gonna talk about if you should add them to your workflow. Or if they're just some cool AI tech without any real-world payoff. Here's an example of the Dialog Matcher matching the room tone from one audio clip to a studio recording audio clip. So I got the mic set up. The reverb, it's real, but it's fine. It's gonna sound totally cinematic. Yeah, if by cinematic you mean echo chamber with tools in the background, real Oscar-worthy stuff, Jason. Hey, some of us are working with natural acoustics here. Not all of us have a studio environment like you do. Well, excuse me for being professionally recorded in a padding booth like a proper voice talent. Okay, okay. Alright, watch this. Individually resolved, we're gonna use some AI tools to make it sound like you're here in the garage with me. Not in the studio. Wow, I sound majestic. Like a wise old dog in a car commercial. Boom. Told ya. Now we both sound like we're in the scene. We're both in the garage here. Well, at least now when I say I want snacks, it has gravitas. I wanna eat the mic. So that was just one of the AI tools and I pretty much did that without much effort. And speaking of powerful AI tools, today's video is sponsored by Artlist and they're doing some really cool things with AI as well. More on Artlist later in this video. But for now, let's jump into DaVinci Resolve, take a look at these three AI audio tools and see if they are game changers or are they just another gimmick? Let's go. In DaVinci Resolve here, we've got our little scene set up and I recorded this in my garage where we've got a lot of ambient and reverb noise. Now I have video of myself in one track. I have the audio for me in its own track. And then I created a second video track with my dog Gemma in it and a second audio track with the voiceover for the dog, which was recorded by one of my daughters. So the whole idea here is that we want the audio recorded in studio to sound like it was recorded in the garage, right? Because there's going to be times where you're adding in, you know, a voiceover to your scene, maybe, and it's not going to sound the same. Your voiceover is probably going to sound really good and really clean, whereas on set, it might not sound as good. You know, you might have natural reverberations or room noise or things like that. So the whole goal is to match these clips up and make it sound like they were filmed in the same place. So the first tool we want to take a look at is the AI level matcher. And in order to use that, we're going to go ahead and jump over into Fairlight. So let's click on the musical notes at the bottom here, jump us over into Fairlight. And once we're in Fairlight here, the first thing we want to do to be able to set these levels, and the reason why real quick that I mentioned doing this first is because you always want to set your audio levels properly first. Get that done before you start doing all of your other audio work. Really important to get those levels set correctly. Now for dialogue, I want it to be about minus 10 dB. And if we take a look at my first clip right here, let's see where that falls. So I got the mic set up. The reverb, it's real, but it's fine. So it's around that minus 10 dB. Perfect. Now we can hear that there's the ambient noise in there, right? And the reverb, which we're going to take care of in a second. But like I said, first, let's use the AI level matcher. Now, if I were to listen to my voice over and watch my meters here, where's that falling? Let's take a look. Yeah, if I sit in a mat, I can mean echo chamber. Okay, so that's at minus 20 dB. So all I'm going to do is select the clip that has the levels I want to match. I'm going to right click, come down to clip operations, level matcher and capture level profile. Resolve will capture that. Now I can just select all of the clips that I want to apply this to. I'm going to right click, come down to clip operations, level matcher and apply level profile. Resolve's going to automatically do it for us. So now they should all sound like they're about the same level. Let's check it out. It's real, but it's fine. It's going to sound totally cinematic. Yeah, if by cinematic, you mean echo chamber with tools in the background. Real Oscar worthy stuff, Jason. Hey, some of us are working with natural acoustics here. Not all of us have a studio environment like you do. Well, excuse me for being perfect. Okay, that sounds good. It looks like our levels are around that minus 10 dB. I think that's perfect, right? We set the levels based on the one clip we already had. And now it's perfect. We don't have to go through clip by clip. So that AI level matcher does a great job. It does exactly what we needed to do. And now we can move on to the next step. And then next step is going to be making our studio recorded voiceover audio sound like it was recorded in the garage. And that's where we're going to use the AI dialogue matcher. So the AI dialogue matcher is going to help you match the ambient sound, the room tone, the overall tone of an audio clip to another audio clip. Now we could go from our studio version and match the garage to that. But in this case, I want the voiceover to sound like it's in the garage. So we're going to match the studio voiceover track to what is in the garage. Here's how we do that. I'm going to come to my first audio clip right here. I'm going to right click on it. And if I come down to AI tools, dialogue matcher, we have capture dialogue profile. So this is going to allow resolve to learn what kind of tone is going on with this particular piece of dialogue. So I'm going to say capture dialogue profile. Resolve is just going to take a second. It's going to capture that profile. And now all we have to do is select the clips we want to apply that profile to. So we're going to apply it to these last three clips of our little scene here. So let me just play through those last little bits so you can hear what it sounds like before we apply the profile. And then we're going to apply the profile and you'll hear it after. Here's what it sounds like before. Wow. I sound majestic like a wise old dog in a car commercial. Boom. Told you. Now we both sound like we're in the scene. We're both in the garage here. Well, at least now when I say I want snacks, it has gravity task. I want to eat the mic. So that's what it sounds like before. You can tell it was recording a studio. It's nice and crisp and clean. So now I'm going to select these clips that I want to apply the profile to. I'm going to right click and we're going to come down to AI tools, dialogue, matcher and apply dialogue profile. Resolve does its thing. It takes a second and now let's play through that again and listen for the room tone and the ambience tone that's now been applied to the studio recorded voice over a.k.a. The dog track. Wow. I sound majestic like a wise old dog in a car commercial. Boom. Told you. Now we both sound like we're in the scene. We're both in the garage here. Well, at least now when I say I want snacks, it has gravity task. I want to eat the mic. So it sounds pretty good. It does a good job of bringing in some of that tonality and reverb of being in the garage, right? Now this can match to any kind of scene that you have. I just the garage for me is, you know, something that's, you know, got a lot of reverb in it and it's just a clear example of kind of how this tool works. Now you might have heard a little mic noise in there. That's just because of the recording. That's not due to the AI tool, but it does a good job of making that voice over sound like it was recorded in the garage. I think I'm pretty happy with that.

Now the AI EQ matcher is going to come in handy when you've recorded something in a particular location using a particular microphone, for example. And then maybe you went and recorded an additional part of the scene or something outside of, you know, that particular environment and used maybe a different microphone. The EQ matcher is going to help you apply the sound and the EQ characteristics of a given microphone to another microphone. So it might sound a little confusing, but I'm going to show you how this works two different ways here. So back at Fairlight here, let's say that I want the Studio mic to have the same kind of profile as the lav mic I used out in the garage. So in order to use the AI EQ matcher, I'm just going to select a clip, right click, we're going to come down to clip operations. We have EQ matcher and we can capture the EQ profile. Once it's captured, you can then select all of the clips that you want to apply that profile to. So let's just say in this case, I want to select these clips right here. I'm going to right click, come down to clip operations, EQ matcher. And now I can apply it to the clip EQ or to the entire track. So let's just say all these are the same. They were all recorded that same microphone as a voiceover. Let's apply the EQ to the track. Now let's just listen to the tonality and kind of see how it sounds and make a judgment call. Is it good? Is it not good or what? So I got the mic set up the reverb. It's real, but it's fine. It's going to sound totally cinematic. Yeah. If by cinematic, you mean echo chamber with tools in the background, real Oscar worthy stuff. Jason. Hey, some of us are working with natural acoustics here. Not all. Okay. So what do we notice there? One, our levels are way high now, right? And if we take a look at the track level EQ, it did some crazy EQ stuff to try and match the tonality. Now in this case, I don't know that it worked very good. I'm not really happy with that. So I'm going to reset that and let me just show you how it might work a little bit better if we go the opposite way, right? If we take the studio mic and we try and match that to what was recorded in the garage on the lab mic. So in this case, I'm going to just undo what we just did. And now I'm going to select my studio recording. I'm going to right click clip operations, EQ, matcher, capture EQ profile. So let's select these two clips. I'm going to right click clip operations, EQ, matcher and apply to track EQ. Now just looking at the EQ that looks a little more reasonable to me, then boosting stuff way up. If you know anything about EQ, I like the cut before I boost. Hold got a whole video on that whole crash course free here on YouTube. You can check that out. But let's give it a listen here and see how it sounds comparing the tonality of the microphone from these two different recordings. So I got the mic set up the reverb. It's real, but it's fine. It's going to sound totally cinematic. Yeah. If by cinematic you mean echo chamber with tools in the background real Oscar worthy stuff. Jase. Okay. So it does sound a little bit more like the studio mic, but let's just jump ahead here to where we actually applied the all of the other room effects and everything to sound like it's in the garage. Let's just hear how they kind of go together. Like you're here in the garage with me, not in the studio. Wow. I sound majestic like a wise old dog in a car commercial. Boom. Told you now. So one thing I do notice is that now the studio recording does sound a little bit muffled. So you might want to just open up your EQ, make a little cut here. It's probably somewhere between 200 and 400. Let's just give it a quick listen. Oh, I sound majestic like a wise old dog in a car commercial. Boom. Told you now we both sound like we're in the scene. We're both in the garage here. Well, at least now when I say I want snacks, it has gravity. All right. So that works pretty good. If we just made a little EQ adjustment there on our studio recording because it got a little muffled and muddy sounding just because we were matching the dialogue with the room noise, the reverb and that kind of stuff. And we can tell we've got the reverb on there because you've got the little effects FX symbol there on the particular clip. So what did you guys think? Are these AI tools here that we learned about today in DaVinci Resolve? Are they great? Are they going to be part of your workflow? Do you think they're helpful or do you think they're just an AI gimmick that you're probably never going to use? Now for me, I'm probably going to try and work some of them into my workflow a little bit, but I'm sure there's going to be times that I'm not going to use them at all either. So I see the benefit of them and I think they can work great in situations like we had here today, but then there's other situations where maybe I just want to kind of figure it all out on my own. But what's your thoughts? Leave me a comment down below with that said. Thank you guys so much for watching. Thank you, Artlist and I will see you in the next video. Peace.
