My name is Jason. I make DaVinci Resolve tutorials to help you. And today is Quick Tip Tuesday. So I'm going to show you how you can quickly add a background behind your text in DaVinci Resolve in two different ways. It's quick and easy. Check it out. So currently I'm in the edit tab right here. I want to open up my effects library. And I'm going to add in both a basic text, drop it in my timeline, as well as a text plus. I'm going to drop that in my timeline. Now you can use either one to do this. And all I have to do is select my text. I'm going to open up my inspector. And this is the basic text. So if I come down here, I can add in a little basic title here, DaVinci Resolve Rules. And let's say I wanted to add a background color to this text. Now typically you might do something like black, but if you scroll down in your inspector, we've got background right here. I'm going to change the color just so that it's something easier for us to see. I'm going to go with red, make it easy to see. And now all we can do is just change our height right here. And boom, we've got a background. We can change the width of it. If you want, you can change the corner radius. Maybe you want a square box, or maybe you want it a little bit of a radius, or maybe even an oval. And also if you wanted to add in an outline color, we can select that. Let's say I was going to go with a blue, say okay, and then I can just increase the outline there. Add a little corner radius. And you can make it look however you want, really quick and easy with some basic text. So let's say you're working with some text plus, you want to select your text plus, come on up into your inspector. And then we want to come into the shading section here. And if we come to, for example, the number two here, we can enable our red outline. And we can just make a few simple adjustments here. I'm going to come down to appearance and click on the solid guy here, we can then come to our level and change this to text. And now you can see we've got a box going on around our text there, you can round out the edges if you want, you can extend it a little bit horizontally or a little bit vertically, you can change the background color to whatever you want it to be right down here. You can even select something from the color wheel that you might like. If you want to apply a little softness to the edges, you can come over here and drag these guys over here on your X and Y axis. And you can use all these other controls to make some changes if you'd like. And if I came back to the text and change the size of my text, the background is going to change with the text for you. So really easy to add in a background behind your text. There you have it adding a background behind your text really quick and easy two different ways here in DaVinci Resolve. There are more advanced ways to do it. Of course you want to jump into Fusion, you can do it over there too, get more advanced with stuff, but for two basic ways to add background behind your text, that's how you can go ahead and do it here in DaVinci Resolve. So that wraps up this quick tip Tuesday and I will see you guys in the next video. Peace. Recording on the C100 Mark II. Love that camera dude, love that thing.
