What's up guys, we're back for a quick tip Tuesday. It's been a hot minute since we did one. Got a great tip for you here today. Let's just jump right in and resolve it. I'm gonna show you this cool tip. So in DaVinci Resolve here, we're in Fairlight and to loop the playback of one of your clips, you used to have to do a few things, hit a weird keyboard shortcut and then you could loop your playback, not anymore. All we have to do is come in and select a range, boom, there we go, put my playhead in there. Just hit this little icon right here, the loop button, and then all you have to do is hit your spacebar. No keyboard shortcut, just hit your spacebar and it's gonna keep looping that video over and over and over again until you wanna stop. Not only can you do it in Fairlight, but you can also do it right here in the edit tab. I'm in the edit tab, I'm gonna set in points and out points, I for in, go ahead a little bit, O for out. Gonna go ahead and turn on my looping icon right here and again, just hit your spacebar and it's gonna loop your playback right here in the edit page. And you can also do it in the cut page. Again, set an in point, go ahead a little bit, set an out point, turn on your looping icon right here and hit spacebar to loop that playback. Now why do I use looping? Because it's super helpful when you're trying to edit your audio, you're working with the EQ, you're trying to find frequencies that you might wanna fix up, maybe you're working with your dynamics and you just wanna hear a small section over and over again so you can really work with that audio and fine tune it. That's when I'm gonna go ahead and use the looping audio button. So there you have it guys, quick tip Tuesday in the books, hope it was helpful and I will see you guys in the next video. Peace.
