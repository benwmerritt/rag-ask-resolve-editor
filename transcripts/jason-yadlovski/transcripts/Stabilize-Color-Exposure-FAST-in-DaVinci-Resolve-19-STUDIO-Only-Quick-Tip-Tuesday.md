Have you ever been filming outside on a bright sunny day and all of a sudden the clouds come and then it changes the color of your image? I had that happen to me recently and I've got a tool here in the color page that's going to make it really easy for you to fix. Let's jump into it. In Resolve here I was filming a little unboxing for a new microphone set that records in 32-bit float and if you look at my screen here we have a color that looks good but then the clouds come and it changes the way my whole image looks. Now I could make a cut where that starts to happen and use keyframes and do all kinds of stuff but there's an easier way to do that and it's called using the color stabilizer. So let's jump over into the color tab right here and I've already gone ahead and put my little grade on there based on what I want this shot to look like. So all I'm going to do is create a new node. I'm going to select my last node, use Option or Alt plus S to add in a node and I want to drop on the color stabilizer. So open your effects, come down to this color stabilizer, I'm going to drop it on my node and now you're going to see we have this little box in our window over here. Make sure you've got this effects overlay turned on and I'm going to go ahead and just make this bigger. Yeah like that looks pretty good. Now over here under the color stabilizer settings we can either analyze the entire frame or just the selected area. So I'm going to go selected area. Now you would want to use whatever area you want the color to stabilize in right. So for me it's mostly around here I mean I could make it smaller you know around just me but I'm going to do this for now and then I'm going to go ahead and hit live region analysis. Resolve is going to do a little calculating there and then we've got channels we can stabilize here. So do you want to do balance and brightness RGB? I'm going to leave it on balance and brightness. I want to stabilize the white balance right because that's one of the big things that changes as the clouds cover up the sun the whole image gets a lot cooler right. So I want to stabilize that. I also want to stabilize the brightness because I want the exposure to stay the same down under the stabilize mode right here you can choose levels and contrast offset or gain and then you've also got some more options down here that I'm just going to leave at the default settings for now. So if I were to move ahead in my frame to where the clouds come you can see now it looks pretty much the same if I turn off that node with the color stabilizer it looks a lot more blueish right and not quite as bright if I turn that node back on now we can see the exposure is a little bit better as well as the color right now obviously the exposure goes down a little bit because the clouds are blocking the sun but it does a pretty good job of balancing that out and for me in this unboxing this was going to be good enough that I don't really need to change much over here. I'm happy with it I think it looks good enough and that color stabilizer made it a really quick and easy job so if you've got exposure or white balance that's shifting on you and you want an easy fix for it try out the color stabilizer I found that it works out pretty good at least in my situation so far but it's one of those tools you can grab slap on there give it a try if it works do two thumbs up less work you have to do there in the color page that wraps up this quick to Tuesday I will see you in the next video peace
