off of Amazon they're like 19 bucks I'll link them in the description below here's what they look like and then the other thing I had was this guy right here so this is just a little screwdriver tool kit that came from Harbor Freight I couldn't have paid more than I don't know 5 bucks 10 bucks for this thing and it's coming super handy not only working on PCs but I'm a Mac guy so working on Macs too this thing's coming real handy so just a little screwdriver kit little electronic screwdriver kit will come in handy for you and again I just picked mine up at Harbor Freight for a few dollars and disclaimer I'm not some kind of repair guy computer repair guy I just didn't want to pay any money to have somebody fix my computer when it looked easy enough just watching some videos here on YouTube and I would only recommend doing this if you're comfortable opening up your machine and all that kind of stuff so it's not on me but here's how I did it and hopefully to help you guys out too if you have the same problem fix your laptop so that way you don't gotta get a new one because 9 times out of 10 your hinges just broke and it'll work just fine if you do it and if you fix it so alright let's get into the repair so as you guys can see here this is where the problem was where the hinge connects to the base of the laptop the screen and the top case of the screen there kind of kept opening up and you couldn't really close it without holding on to it so that way it didn't just snap all the plastic so that's what we're gonna fix and the reason is because the hinges broken so you got to get your parts together I have one of these nice blue mats anti-static mats with a little magnetic parts that work really good just kind of helps to keep everything in order and keep it from flying all over to place when you're opening up the laptop because some of these screws are very small so the first thing that you need to do is flip the laptop over and you need to take out all the screws on the bottom that hold the bottom part of the case on just make sure you get all of them there's one or two in the middle and you also have to take off the cover for the extra memory if you're gonna put that in as well as the cover for the RAM and this is gonna allow you to be able to take the back of the laptop off now to get the back of the laptop off there are some little snaps in there I used a little plastic tool to help kind of pry it up a little bit just be careful you don't want to break anything work your way around the edges and that back piece should be able to pop right off so just take your time work around the edges make sure you get all the screws you can see I missed a few here so make sure you get all the screws so that you can open this guy up and once I opened it up I disconnected the battery just so I didn't have any power going to anything I didn't want to mess anything up I noticed there was a lot of dust in there too which I'll clean out in a minute but for now I want to close this guy back up flip the laptop over I'm gonna open it up and I want to take off the bezel that's around the screen itself so it's pretty easy you just kind of work around it slowly there's little plastic snaps that hold it on and eventually it should just pop right off as you can see here I did break one of the little clips on the side of the bezel I just use a little crazy glue put it back on it worked out fine it was no problem once the bezels off the next thing we need to do is take the screen out there's four screws in each corner that hold the screen on you want to do those but be careful with the wire that connects from the base of the laptop to the screen you don't want to pull that out and yank on it once you get the screen loose just lay it down easily you can see the broken piece of the arm popped out there you want to be careful with the wires make sure that nothing's going to get pinched nothing's in the way because we're going to close the laptop down and flip it back over so we can take the back off and start to remove the screws that hold in the hinges now there are some pieces of tape as well as some wires that run around these hinges so be very careful remember how everything goes and remember where the screws go take a picture because they have to go back in the same spot once I got the first side out I started working on the next side and this is the broken side so part of the thing just came right out part of the hinge came right out and I had to unscrew some of the screws and work the wires around the other part of the hinge now I did notice the machine was pretty dusty so here I went through and kind of dusted it off a little bit cleaned out the fans because I didn't want all the big chunks of dust in there didn't want to get heated up while I'm working on it so clean it out while you're there I cleaned off the cover as well and that way it should run good and cool for you once you get the cover off once you get it all back together so now I put the back on and opened up the lid again and now we're going to start working on the hinges on the lid side of the laptop so the best way to get the hinges off and work with it is get a little helper and hold the laptop with the screen side down so that way nothing falls out on you don't bust up any of the wires or anything like that. So you want to go ahead and take out the screws that are holding the hinges in and be careful with the wires. Some of the wires are pretty close. You may need to take some of them off, but remember how they go because you're going to have to put them back when you go to put it back together. Now there are a few little bolts that come on the hinge itself. You want to make sure you take those off, get all the screws out together, keep the bolts and the screws together so that way when we put it back together, you can put everything in the right spot. Now one thing I did notice is that where some of the bolts were supposed to remain on the top of the laptop, they did fall out. The plastic did get broken, but I was able to just kind of lay them back in there for some of them. And then for other ones, I was able to just attach the bolt with the screw. So here I'm putting some of the bolts back into the hinge, trying to connect it back to the chassis there, the laptop. And you notice that I did have the problems, like I said, with getting the bolts on and staying in the top of the laptop cover. So what I did was I just held the bolt on the back of the hinge and put my screw in. And when I laid it back down into the top of the laptop, everything worked out okay. It lined back up and it stayed in there just fine. I had no problems with it. So once I pulled all the parts and pieces off the old ones, you can see I'm still trying to get some of those little bolts to go back into the plastic housing on the top of the laptop. But like I said, most of them, I was able to just hold the bolt, put the screw back in the new arm there and it worked out just fine. And you do have to kind of move the laptop around a little bit to get in there. It's a little tricky. Definitely helps if you have an extra hand, but not impossible. You just got to go slow and take your time and be careful with everything. Now here I'm trying to get the new hinge to go around all the wires and get the wires back in the right spot, putting the screws back in, making sure they went back in exactly where they came out. So that way when I go to put everything back together, it everything lines up and that's good to go. Then moving over to the other side, working on that one, we're going to do the same thing. We're going to open the laptop a little to help get that old one out. We're going to slide the new one in, make sure we can weave it around all the wires, just how the old one was. Once you're able to get the new hinges in, you want to flip it back over and now we're going to reattach the screen. Make sure your wires are all out of the way. You want to tuck them back into the little holders and the little clips and things that were there. So you got to take note when you're taking this thing apart as far as where it does everything go. And then we're going to go ahead and put the screws back in the four corners of the screen so that the screen is attached back to the lid and to our hinges. And we should be looking pretty good here. And definitely make sure you tuck in those wires so that when you close the lid and put the bezel back on, it's not going to get in the way of anything. And I did make sure to clean everything up here. I cleaned the screen a little bit where I'm not going to be able to reach it underneath the bezel just to make sure that everything's going to look good. The bezel just pops back on. It's pretty easy. Then we're going to turn the laptop back over. We're going to reconnect the battery here, throw the cover back on, and actually before you even do that, make sure you've got all your screws in the right spot for the hinges. Make sure everything looks good. You can see I actually put a screw in the wrong spot there. Here I'm checking the holes to make sure that they line up with what I can see inside the laptop. Checking the screen. Hinges work great. No problem. Now I'm going to go through and put all my screws back in the base as well as put my two covers on the bottom back on. And then we should be good to go. You should have a good functioning screen on your laptop. The hinges should work good. Again, make sure you put your covers back on, the screws back in the covers. When you're done, flip it on over, open it up, fire it up. And you should be good to go with a perfectly working screen for your laptop.
