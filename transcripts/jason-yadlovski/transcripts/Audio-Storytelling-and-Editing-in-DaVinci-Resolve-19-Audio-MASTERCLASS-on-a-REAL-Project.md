## Transcript
It's time for some real world audio editing and you are going to be able to follow along with us. Today we're going to be taking a look at a voiceover track as well as a music track that we need to start doing some audio work on that's going to be part of a larger project here and truth be told this video has a bigger mission than just showing you guys how to work with our audio from start to finish on a video. Myself along with some of our other Resolve creator friends here on YouTube have gotten together to put together this video for heart support. Heart support is a non-profit organization that helps people with mental health and they do that by using music. So they try to reach people that maybe otherwise would not reach out for help with mental health issues and I don't know if you guys out there have struggled with mental health issues. I sure have. I still do today. We've got depression, anxiety, things like that that are always a challenge to deal with and we're always working through it. I'm always working through it. So we wanted to help bring some awareness to mental health as well as help support heart support here and we have a goal of trying to raise $5,000. There is a donation link on the side of the video over here or down below. So if you are interested in helping support mental health for those in need, we would love if you guys could donate to this awesome cause and that's really the main reason we're trying to put together this video. Put it on the heart support homepage there to help bring awareness to mental health and to the awesome work that heart support is doing for those that are in need of some mental health. We're working start to finish today with a voiceover track as well as some music. We're mixing it together with the video that's already been created and worked on by Alex, by Patrick and by Chloe. And now today we're going to be working on the audio. So if you want to follow along with us, you can get all these files for free, all the video files, the audio files. We're going to link them down below so you can go ahead over to that link, download those files and then you can follow along and do the same things that we do or maybe even try to make your own edit and see how it works out. So with all that said, let's jump into resolve here. We're going to start working with our audio for the heart support landing page. Let's go jump into resolve here. I'm going to be editing with my headphones today, my Sennheiser HD 280 Pros. And that's what we're going to use to run through our audio edit. Now, one thing to keep in mind, if you're editing on headphones, you may want to at some point try listening to your audio edit through a pair of speakers. And generally I'm going to edit my audio, you know, in this case, when I'm recording with my headphones and then I'm going to see how it sounds on my monitor speakers, just make sure everything sounds good. So that's one tip for you right there is always check your audio on different sources, especially once you're done, make sure that it's sounding good, but good in different spots, check your phone, check your iPad, check your computer, check your speakers, check your headphones and just make sure nothing sounds way out of whack once your audio edit is done. So in the project here, if you've downloaded the files with us, you should have all of these different files in DaVinci Resolve. And I'm going to go ahead and bring down our voiceover, which is this one right here, the take two. Now I've created a timeline that just has our video clips in it that has all of our cuts, make that a little bigger, it's got our cuts and it has our color grade in it already. So that's what I'm going to use as the base timeline here for our audio edit. So I've got two audio tracks here, and I'm going to take my take two here, which is our voiceover track, and I'm going to drop that into the timeline. Now currently it's set up as a stereo track. That's the way the track was made in my project here. I'm going to go ahead and change that to a mono track by right clicking. I'm going to come down to change track type two and choose mono. And I'm also going to rename my track by double clicking here. And we're going to call this voiceover. So I'm just going to call it VO. Now I'm going to want to put my music in track number two. So I'm just going to click on track two and rename that music. And I'm going to go ahead and mute that for right now, but I can go ahead and drag my music track down in there just so it's there and it's ready to go. Once we're ready to work with our music. But what I like to do is work with my voiceover first and get that set up. And then we'll move on to working with the music. So let's listen to a little bit of our voiceover track here and just see what we've got and how it's sounding. So I'm going to start here. We're going to play through. Now we can see that our voiceover track is quite a bit longer. If I just zoom all here using shift Z, our voiceover track is quite a bit longer than our video. So we're going to have to go ahead and cut this up a little bit, which we'll get to in a minute. But let's just give it a quick listen and see how it's sounding right off the bat here. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. Okay. So off the bat, it does sound pretty good, right? Sounds pretty crisp, really clear. It almost sounds like it's got a little too much high. I was almost a little too crispy, I think. So we're going to work with that a little bit, maybe a little bit of EQ in there. And then there is a little bit of background noise. So we're going to want to take care of that. But overall, it's not too bad. So the first step in the process that I think I would do with this is that since I can hear it, okay, I'm going to open up my mixer. Just take a quick look at some of my levels here on my voiceover track. I want to see how close I am to getting to this minus 10 dB here. Just see if we're in the ballpark and, you know, kind of see where our levels are falling at. So let's go ahead and give this a listen and watch our meters over here to see where our audio levels are at. I've had fans tell me night after night for 20 years, the cost that that has. Suicide, addiction. All right, so it's not too bad. We'll work with it some more in a little bit. But the first thing I think I want to do is actually go through and cut up this audio so we can, you know, tighten up the gaps. We want to get rid of the gaps, essentially. So do that. I'm going to come to the beginning of my timeline here. And I'm actually going to go ahead and lock my music track. Now, Alex showed you how you could lock a music track in his video. But if you hit the lock track now, whenever I make a cut or anything, it's not going to affect our music track. I also want to go ahead and lock our video track because I don't want anything to change there. So now only my voiceover track is unlocked. And that's the only track that I'm going to be affecting when I make my cuts. So you can use your blade tool right here. But for me, I've got my keyboard set up where I can use keyboard shortcuts to make things go a little quicker. So if I wanted to make a cut, I can just hit S right here. And it's going to make a cut for me. I'm going to come ahead to where the next piece of audio starts. I want to make a cut and then ripple, delete everything before it to close up the gap there. I have my keyboard shortcut set to Q and W. I know Alex had mentioned in his videos, you know, he used the one numbers one, two and three. Great way to do it. Whatever works best for you. Do I would do it because it just makes your editing so much quicker. So all I have to do is press my Q key and boom, it makes a cut and deletes the gap for me. So I'm just going to go through my timeline here and I'm going to get rid of all of these spaces here that we have in between our voiceover track. Now we can always spread them back out a little bit later if we need to, to move clips around. But for now, I'm going to go through and just get rid of all the gaps. Now, if there's one like this, maybe I want to keep it. Maybe I don't. We're going to listen to it and see what we think. When we found music, it changed our lives. Okay. So that like that one's okay. But the next one, I'm going to go ahead and make a cut on that one. And you can use your arrow keys to get a little more exact with where your position is. If you hold shift in your arrow keys, it'll jump ahead a second. Just some quick little tips there for you. So I'm going to go ahead and just chop out a lot of these dead spaces. So a quick tip here that you might want to look for is where there's breaths like this. It's a, I would try and cut that breath out just to, you know, get rid of that because we don't want that in our final video there. So you could just do the best you can. You know, you don't want to cut it too close to your dialogue. But again, we can always adjust it later if we need to. So just something to keep in mind. So we've gone through here. We've made all of our cuts. We kind of got rid of the gaps and stuff. Now we may want to add some of those back in because the next thing I want to do is start to look at how does our audio correspond with our video clips. Does it make sense? Do I need to shift things a little bit? And I can tell you off the bat, we do need to shift things a little bit just so that it makes sense when the voiceover comes in and it relates to the video that we're seeing on the screen. So let's watch through that a little bit and we're going to see where we might need to make some changes. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our. Okay. So did to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. So I think once I start here, I want to move these all over a little bit. So I can use the option or alt plus Y key to select everything moving forward and then just move these guys over a little bit to maybe where the next clip starts. So we've got a little bit of a break in there. Let's see how that sounds. Felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. I've had fans tell me night. Okay. So we're now we're just going to go through and continue doing the same thing and kind of see where we might want to ship stuff. So let me just watch this again here. See what we might want to do. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to. It changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. I think I want to move this over a little bit. So again, option Y so I can grab everything. And since our two tracks are locked on the top and the bottom, they're not going to move on us so we can just drag our other track over. Just create a little space there. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. I've had fans tell me night after night for 20 years, the cost that that has. Suicide, addiction, suicide, years, the cost. That that has. And that takes a toll on our mental health. I've had fans tell me night after night for 20 years, the cost that that has. Suicide. OK, so I think with this clip right here, I think I want to get rid of that because as we're going through the video clips here, I think what they're saying around this clip pertains to the clips we see on our scene. So I'm going to select this part. I'm going to delete that. And let's see if I just bring this back here. Let's see this one. What does it say? That has. Well, on our mental health, that that has. So let's put these together and we're going to bring this guy down because the goal is we want to tell the story, right? We want the audio to go along with the story of the video. So that's what we're trying to do here is piece together what we've got to tell a story of what's happening, right? We want to try and build in some emotion if we can and just make sure that the dialogue, the voiceover goes along with the video and tells a good story. So that's what I'm trying to do here is build out the story. Go alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health that that has. OK, so we don't need this one that that has. We can get rid of that. Feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. Suicide, addiction, self harm. All right. So I think that's good. I don't think it should be that way. All right, we're going to bring back the next clip, next two clips, actually. And what I want to do is actually maybe instead of starting it right on the new clip, back it up a little bit, almost like, you know, a J cut, L cut, I guess that's a J right that way. And see how that sounds. And we do the same with the clip before that. Back it up a little bit, a couple of frames. I can use my period and comma key to bump that audio clip left or right if I need to, and then I'll move it frame by frame. So that's a handy little tip there that I use all the time. Oh, by the way, if you don't have a cup of coffee, you should get a cup of coffee so you can edit, have a coffee and continue editing. I always have some coffee while I edit. All right, back to it. Chin, self harm. I don't think it should be that way. The sense of family we experience shouldn't just be inside these walls. That's why heart support exists. It's a community for our music scene that sense of family we experience shouldn't just be inside these walls. OK, so I don't think that this clip is necessary either. So let's go ahead and just drag these guys back next to clips over. See if this fits with our video a little bit better. Self harm. I don't think it should be that way. That's why the support exists. It's a community for our music scene that keeps us connected to the music. We love to the people who created it. That's why it's a sport exists. It's a community for our music scene that keeps us connected. To the music we love to the. It's a community for our music scene that to the music we love to the people who created it again just trying to piece these together and And to the people who love that music with us. So if you need to extend a clip back out just to see what was there or I deleted some things I just want to kind of double check it. You can always just grab the end and pull out your clip there. I'm going to just continue to listen in and see how we can build out the story. Keeps us connected. To the music we love, to the people who created it. And to the people who love that music, it's us connected. To the music we love, to the people who created it. And to the people who love that music with us. We bring people together through the power of music. And that you need somebody to reach out to. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and and this community has people who are trained to support their through the power of music to have. And to the people who love that music with us. We bring people together through the power. I'm going to try this clip here to see how that sounds. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. It's people who are trained to support you. Confronting your struggles and fighting for your mental health doesn't just change you. It brings change to everyone around you. It's okay to be broken. You're allowed to be human, but you are not alone because we have each other. Welcome to heart support. Let's try these three, bring them over. And to the people who love that music with us. We bring people together. We bring people together through the power. Okay, so we got a double there, so we're going to get rid of that. Bring this one back. Of that music with us. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. Confronting your struggles and fighting for your mental health doesn't just change you. It brings change to everyone around you. It's okay to be broken. You're allowed to be human. All right, so I think I want to move things around a little bit. I might want to take this clip here, which sounds like this. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to support you. And I want to move that back to maybe about here. So let's see if we can swap that with this. It's a community for our music scene that keeps us connected to the music we love to the people who create. That are authentic and vulnerable for the we bring people together through the power of music to have genuine addiction, self harm. I don't think it should be that way. That's why hearts are so important to us. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine addiction, self harm. That's why heart support exists. Okay, so let's just drag this over here. This little extra clip there. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. So I like that good because when it says you need somebody to reach out to, it corresponds with the girl on the screen here that looks like she needs somebody to reach out to. So I'm liking that. Times that you need somebody to reach out to. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine confronting your struggles and fighting for your mental health doesn't and this community has people who are trained to support you and encourage you so you can grow and heal in your own confronting your. Alright, so I like this one. Let's bring this back here because it is talking about the people who are going to be able to help you while it's showing on screen people helping people and you know maybe working together a schedule here or something to help out people who need it. So try that. Authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. And this community has people who are trained to support you and encourage you so you can grow and heal in your own unique path. So you can grow and heal support you and encourage you so you can grow and heal in your own unique path to have genuine relationships that are authentic. Conferencing your struggles and fighting for your mental health doesn't just mean unique path. Conferencing your struggles and fighting for your mental health doesn't just change you. It brings change to everyone around you. It brings change to everyone around you. It's okay to be broken. You're allowed to be human. But you are not alone because we have each other. Welcome to Heart Support. Okay, so let's watch it through once now. It's a little long so we may need to cut a little bit more out of here but let's kind of see how it's coming together here. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something different. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. Suicide, addiction, self-harm. I don't think it should be that way. That's why Heart Support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. And this community has people who are trained to help you. We have a community that is open to all of you. We have a community that is open to all of you. We have a community that is open to all of you. We have a community that has people who are trained to support you and encourage you so you can grow and heal in your own unique path. Confronting your struggles. Okay, so I think we might be able to shorten up this long clip here a little bit. Let's take a look at this. Heart Support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic. Okay, so let's take out this middle part through genuine relationships. Let's just see if we can tighten this up a little bit. We bring people together through the power of music. I cut that. To have genuine relationships. Okay, let's try that. We bring people together through the power of music that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. And this community has people who are trained to help you. I don't know if I like that. I'm going to Command or Control Z to undo that. Let's just take another look. Maybe we could just tighten it up a little bit. Let's see. We bring people together. So I'm going to back this guy up a little bit. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationship of music. To have genuine relationships. We're going to just tighten it up a little bit. That are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. Somebody to reach out to. And this community has people who are trained to support you and encourage you so you can grow and heal in your own unique path. And this community has people who are trained to support you and encourage you so you can grow and heal in your own unique path. Confronting... So you can grow and heal and heal... So you can grow and heal in your... See if we cut this up here, shorten that up and just see how that sounds. Curious. Do. And this community has people who are trained to support you. And encourage you so you can grow and heal... Confronting your struggles and fighting... So I may want to pull this out and just fade it out a little. Grow and heal. Confronting your struggles and fighting... So I may want to pull this out and just fade it out a little. Grow and heal. heal, confronting your struggles and fighting for your mental health doesn't just change you. It brings change to everyone around you. Health doesn't just change you. It brings change to everyone around you. It's okay to be broken. I'll shorten this clip up a little bit right here. Just change you. It brings change to everyone around you. It's okay to be broken. Too short. I shortened it up too much there so I'm just gonna commander control Z, undo that, pull it back just a little bit, delete the gap. Change to everyone around you. It's okay to be broken. You're allowed to be human but you are not alone because we have each other. Welcome to Heart Support. Alright so I think that sounded pretty good. Let's watch through it one more time in its entirety here and see how it's all flowing and see if it goes together good. But I think we're getting to a good spot here that I'm happy with before we actually start editing the audio and making it sound better than it already does because it does sound pretty good so far but we're gonna make it sound even better. So let's go ahead and play through it and see where we're at. When we found music it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls it's easy to feel alone and that takes a toll on our mental health. Suicide, addiction, self-harm. I don't think it should be that way. That's why Heart Support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. And this community has people who are trained to support you and encourage you so you can grow and heal. Confronting your struggles and fighting for your mental health doesn't just change you. It brings change to everyone around you. It's okay to be broken. You're allowed to be human but you are not alone because we have each other. Welcome to Heart Support. All right, so not too bad. It does sound a little weird how we faded it out in the one part there. I think once you add in the music, I don't think you're going to notice it, but let me just take another look there and see if there's a little something else we can do there. I don't know if we want to stretch it out. I don't know. Let's see. So you can grow and heal and you're confronting your struggles. Yeah, I don't know. I'm going to leave it faded out for now and we're going to kind of see how it comes together once we add in our music. But it's okay. It's all right. It's a good place to start. We can always come back and change it later if I need to. Now let's get into some editing of the actual audio. We've gone ahead and cut it up a little bit. First thing, I think the levels are okay. So we're going to leave those where they're at to start. Let's go ahead and jump over into Fairlight because what I want to do is work with some EQ. So I'm just going to zoom my entire timeline with Shift Z here. And actually, I'm going to zoom in a little bit more because my music tracks long. So we're going to zoom in, use Shift in my middle mouse wheel to make the tracks a little bit bigger. So first thing I want to do is work with a little EQ on my voiceover track. So I want to come to my mixer here. If you don't have your mixer open, just close our inspector because we don't need that mixer right here. And in our mixer, first, I actually want to come to the order, right? I want to change the order. I want to click on my dropdown here and I want to go effects, I'm sorry, EQ, dynamics and effects. So that's the order that I like to work in. Now let's go ahead and open up our EQ. Now in our EQ, there's a couple of things that we're going to start out with. And then we're going to look for some problem areas. So the first thing I want to do is get rid of any of the lower end frequencies that we don't need. So I'm going to turn on band one and probably bring this up around 120 somewhere around there. But let's go ahead and play through our clip. I'm going to turn this on, bring it up and see if it's making a difference and cutting out some of the lower end frequencies that we just don't need in our voiceover track. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. Suicide, addiction, self-harm. Okay, so you can see the difference there on our new frequency analyzer in Resolve 19. So that's making a good difference. Now I want to look around and see if I could find any areas that don't sound good. Because it sounds like there's a little harsh high end frequencies in there that I'm not liking. So we're going to see if we can find those, as well as any other areas that might be giving us a little problems that could just help clean it up a little bit. So what I'm going to do is come in my timeline, I'm going to grab my range tool, and let's just pick a little selection here that we can start with, right, that we're just going to loop so it'll play over and over again. So that way we can continue to make adjustments without worrying about having to like hit stop, move the playhead back, play again and all that. So I'm going to just select a range. You can use your in and out points, you can use the range selection tool right here. And then I'm going to use the looping icon. And then as long as your playhead is somewhere in between those two in and out points, you can just hit spacebar and play through your audio. So now I'm going to grab a point here, I'm going to bring it up, sweep it around and see if we find any problem areas. Beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, bigger. Music. Music. Music. businessman music it's. Music. Music. Music. Music is our home, these are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone Kunst is our home, these are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone, but beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger music is our home. Music is our home, these are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy. All right. So I So I think that helped. It seemed like a few areas that were a little bit of problems. Now it does seem like it thinned it out a little bit, but that's okay. We're going to beef it back up and kind of fill it back in here in a minute with with an effect that we're going to use. But I think this is a good place to start with just kind of cleaning it up a little bit. And let's just move ahead a little to a different section here just so you can hear a little before and after. I'm going to make a new range here so we can hear a new here a little before and after. So new range here is a little before and after. That's why heart support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. And this community has people who are trained to. Okay, so I think that's all right. Hopefully you can hear the difference there. It did thin it out a little bit, but like I said, we're going to use an effect to kind of bring back some of the body to our dialogue here. So another thing that I did was I just kind of took off a little bit of the high end there. It sounds very crisp up top. So I'm trying to take care of that a little bit, but maybe we're going to work with that with any effect that we'll get to in a minute here as well. So I think that's pretty good. Now one thing we did notice is that we lost some of our levels, right? So if I play through this section here and then we watch our meters here, watch where our current levels are sitting. Or of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need. So we lost a little bit. Not too bad though, but we're going to work on that next in our dynamics panel. So let's go ahead and open up our dynamics. And actually a quick note before we get going on the dynamics, there is a little bit of background noise or a little hiss in the background there that you can hear. Now if you have studio, what you can do is actually, let me just close our dynamics. You can actually just come to your track and right here in Fairlight or in the edit tab, you can turn on voice isolation. And by turning that on and using just a little bit of voice isolation, maybe 20% or something like that around 20, that's going to take care of that for you. You're not going to have to worry about it. You'll be good to go. But if you don't have studio, another thing you can try is to open the inspector or under your track effects here in Fairlight, but inspector, if you're in the edit tab, and you can try the dialogue leveler because inside the dialogue leveler, there is a background noise reduction. Now I don't think it works as it doesn't work as good as the voice isolation in this case with some of that background noise, but it's an option for you to try that will level out some of your levels for you there. We're going to do it using the dynamics panel and an expander and the compressor, but you can use the dialogue leveler here. If you just want to turn something on, click a few buttons and just move ahead and just go. So that's just two other options that you can use there. So I'm going to turn those two off and just assume that you don't have voice isolation. So let's jump into our dynamics panel and I'll show you what I'll do. So in our dynamics panel here, I'm going to go ahead and turn on my compressor and we want to just see where our levels are falling. We want to add a little bit of compression, which will be shown by our middle meter here. We can see the C down here. And then our first meter here is going to be our expander, which we'll add in a minute. So let's take a look at our compressor and see what we can do. So I would start with my ratio. I like to put this around 2.5 for dialogue. Let's go ahead and play through and see how it's looking so far. To bring back some more of my levels there and my gain to boost it back up, I'm going to use my makeup slider to push it back up and make it a little bit louder. Genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. And this community has people who are trained to support you and encourage you so you can grow and heal. That's why Heart Support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. And this community... So I think that's okay right there. Well, what I'm doing is I boosted up my makeup a little bit to make it a little bit louder. And I've adjusted my compressor to the 2.5 and I'm dialing back the threshold until I see some gain reduction happening here. Now, in general, you probably don't want to see more than, you know, minus six or so of gain reduction on your dialogues there. I did adjust the knee a little bit, which the knee just says ease into the compressor a little bit. Don't just hit that point and bam compressor kind of ease into it. So that's kind of what your knee does. Now the rest of the settings in here, you can just leave as is for now. And then I just kind of compensated by using my makeup to push it up a little bit more once I adjusted my threshold. It's kind of a back and forth thing, right? You work with one, you work with the other, you kind of watch your meters on the output meter right here and kind of see what will work best for you. I need a sip of coffee. So to get rid of a little bit of that background noise, I'm going to turn on my expander and you can see right now we've actually boosted the background noise because the light gray line here is where any of that lower noise is going to sit. And you can see we've actually made it a little bit louder. So by turning on my expander, you can see it lights up my meter here. It's going to drop it down a little bit. And then you've got two options. You can change your ratio here. The range doesn't do too much in this case, but you can change your threshold here too to bring it. If you move that up, then you can see the range doing a little bit of work there. But depending on where you have the threshold, the range might not do too much for you. So let's just play through it and I'm going to turn that on, see if we can hear or see a difference on the meters. That's why Heart Support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. And this community has people who are trained to support you and encourage you so you can grow and heal. That's why Heart Support exists. So let's drag this out towards the end here. I just want to hear how this fade is sounding so far. Let's play through that part. Support you and encourage you so you can grow and heal, confronting your struggles and fighting for your mental health. Does it? That's why Heart Support exists. Okay, so we can see the expander working there and it's just kind of reducing any of that noise that folds below minus 30 dB here, right? A little bit of that static noise, for example. If I took one of these clips here, in between the dialogue here, for example, you're going to hear what that background noise sounds like. And you can see it on our meter right here, right? So it's quiet, but you can hear it. Maybe if I turn up the volume, you can hear it more. So if I just select this part here, you should be able to hear it. Let's loop that. If I turn on my dynamics, see how it got a lot quieter there and you can change it as much as you need to. And essentially, we're getting rid of some of that noise that's going to happen in between the words of the person talking, doing the voiceover. So that's kind of what we're trying to accomplish there. So I'm just going to delete that. I think this is going to be good enough for our dynamics at this point. I'm going to clear my in and out points here, my timeline using an option or alt on a PC plus the X key. And let's go ahead and zoom back out a little bit, close our dynamics. We're going to leave that as it is for now. And we're going to move on to using some effects. So let's jump back to the beginning of our timeline with our playhead. Under our effects, there's two that I'm probably going to use right now. And I'm thinking we're going multi band compressor to help bring back some body to our dialogue. And I'm thinking a de-esser, right? Because we still have some of those higher harsh S frequency sounds and the de-esser should help us kind of tame that back a little bit, right? We could have did it with a little more EQ or shifting around our EQ a little bit, but I think the de-esser is going to do a good job for us. So we're going to give that a try. First thing I want to do is get my multi band compressor. So the first thing we're going to do is come to our effects, click on the plus, come down to dynamics, fair lady effects and multi band compressor. So if you haven't used a multi band compressor before, what this does is it kind of takes certain frequency ranges. And in this case, we have four bands and it'll add a little bit of compression to those different bands. Now the bands are adjustable, we can change them around a little bit. So what I'm going to do is just play through my dialogue here and I'm going to watch it and listen to it and make some adjustments. And then I'll talk about the adjustments that we made after we were done making those adjustments. So let's go ahead and play through and tweak this guy a little bit and make it sound better. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. Juicide, addiction, self harm. I don't think it should be that way. That's why heart support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. And this community has people who are trained to support. Okay, so I made a couple quick adjustments here. Now what did I do? So looking at our different bands here, our low end band here, we don't need, right? We EQ that out already. So the audio signals hitting our EQ, we've already taken out the low end. So by the time it goes to our dynamics and then our effects, our multi band compressor, we're not even getting anything down here below 80. So I don't care about that, right? So I'm not going to make any changes there. Now to bring back some of the body and the warmth of the dialogue, I'm going to look in our second area of the multi band compressor here. And you can make an adjustment. You can drag this back and forth where I put it at 520. It sounded kind of good there. But anywhere between maybe, you know, two to 500 somewhere in there, you can move it around and then I gave it a boost, right? And by giving it a boost, that kind of brought back some of the body of the dialogue there. So if I just play through this little section here and turn this one on and off, you'll hear the difference. Community has people who are trained to support you and encourage you so you can grow. So can you hear that? It just brings back a little bit more fullness to the dialogue there. Now the next section here from 500 to around 3K is where a lot of the vocal lives. And I don't want to boost that too much because then it's going to sound too hollow, right? So I kind of just did a slight, you know, adjustment there as far as where the range is, but as far as the actual compressor and the gain on it, I kind of just left it where it's at because it's not that bad, right? It sounds pretty good. And then in band four, so anything above 3000 on our, you know, our frequency analyzer there or in the EQ, I wanted to bring them down just a little bit because to me, it's just a little harsh on my ear, right? It's a little, it's a little too sharp, a little too, too crisp, if you will. So I wanted to just tame it back a little bit. So I think by reducing the gain on that a little bit, that's going to give us what we want. Now I'm going to play through it one more time and I'm going to watch my output meter to see are we still around that minus 10 dB because by making some adjustments there, we may lose some of our audio volume or our audio gain. So what I can do if we are losing or gaining too much is adjust the gain in the effect right here. So I'm going to play through it. I'm going to watch my meter here, see where we're falling and see if we need to make any adjustments. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. All right. So I think that's good. It looked a little low to me. So I boosted it up 3.7. Again, I just watched my meters boost it up a little. Now it's okay if it goes over 10 a little bit. Not a big deal. It's going to be just fine. So I think this is good. I think we're good with our multi-band compressor. So I'm going to go ahead and close that out. Now next I'm going to add on the de-esser that we talked about. So I'm going to come to my effects. We're going to come down to restoration, Fairlight effects and de-esser. Now in our de-esser here, I do like to make a couple of changes off the bat. You could come up here and go to male ESS for the harsh S sounds. And I like to change the frequency range here to the tighter one. I don't want to affect that many frequencies. So I'm going to play through this, just try it, see how it sounds, see if it's doing anything. I'll notice on my reduction meter right here if it's working. We'll see this light up. If I move this point back and forth here and the reduction lights up more, maybe that's where we have more of an issue. If I only want to hear those harsh S's, I can click on this and it's going to make me hear only the harshest sounds wherever this is boosted. So I can sweep it back and forth and kind of try and find where the problem area is. Let's just play through our clip, see what this is sounding like and then we will make adjustments if we need to. And if we want to change our frequency, I would just grab this and move it back and forth and kind of see what looks like on the meter it's doing the most as well as sounds like it's doing the most. I don't think it should be that way. That's why heart support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. And this community has people who are trained to support you and encourage you so you can grow and heal. Confronting your struggles and fighting for your mental health doesn't just change you, it brings change to everyone around you. It's okay to be broken. You're allowed to be human, but you are not alone because we have each other. And the heart support. It changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. Suicide, addiction, self-harm, I don't think it should be that way. Alright, so I think Boat moving this up a little bit there does a good job. I think we're kind of catching some of those harsh S's. You don't want it too much. If you crank it up like this, it might almost sound like you have a little lift or something like that. Like it's going to just cut out too much. So just a little bit is all that you need there. And that should do a good enough job for you. So I think that sounds pretty good to me. I think we're set there. So the last thing I'm going to do is just play through a little bit more of it. I'm going to watch my meters down here in my mixer to make sure our levels are still looking good. Now I can adjust it here on my faders if I want. Or I can always go back to my effects and boost the gain there. If I need to. But let's just listen to a little bit more of it, watch our meters here and see if our levels are still in a good spot. That way. That's why Heart Support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need. Alright, that's good. I think I'm happy with that. I'm just going to go with that and we should be good to go there. So now let's move on to working with our music, right? We want our music to be present but not overpowering. We want our dialogue to sit within that music well. We want to make space in the music for the dialogue to sit in the middle. So let's talk about how we do that. So I'm going to unlock my music track here. And looking at my music track here we can see that it starts and actually I'm going to lock my voice over track there. Let's zoom in. And I can see that the music doesn't start until, you know, a little bit after the clip starts. So I'm going to just back this up because I think I want the music to start right away. Zoom in nice and close here. Let's have the music start right in the beginning of the video. I'm going to bring this back. Now we could use some of the new tools here in DaVinci Resolve 19. We could use our ducker if we wanted to, right? If we... I'm going to jump back to the edit tab and show you guys there. So in the edit tab here I could select my track by clicking on it, open my inspector and we've got our new ducker right here. I could use that. I could try that if I want and have the source be my vocal track. So we could try that. I don't know. Let's just crank it up to 18. Let's see what it does. See how it sounds. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other. So we can see all of the bad. I don't think it's working good because it's just jumping around too much, right? So if I open up my ducker here, I can move the look ahead up a little bit so that way it works a little bit quicker. The rise time, how quickly does it bounce back to full volume, right? So I wanted that to like fade in, right? I don't want it to be too fast. So I mean, maybe, you know, it's actually not even going to do it till the end of the video because I don't want the sound to jump up in these small breaks that I have in my dialogue, right? I want that music to stay down because it's going to sound weird if it's like popping up and popping down with volume as there's like some breaks in the voiceover track. So I don't want it to do that. So to make sure that I'm preventing that, I'm going to increase the hold here. I want to make this half a second and I think that should be good. Let's just see what happens here. And recovery, three quarters of a second, that's fine. So let's see how this sounds. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. Suicide, addiction, self-harm. I don't think it should be that way. That's why heart support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have... Okay. I'm pretty loud and I don't know if I want to keep with the ducker here or I just want to kind of do it a little bit more manually. I think I'm going to go and do it a little bit more manually. So while you can use the ducker here, it may work in your situation. It may not, but it's worth a try. And it's a great tool, you know, quick and easy to just throw on there. I think we would still need to make more adjustments to it. But I'm going to work with this a little bit manually here. So I'm going to turn the ducker off and let's zoom in here. Now as they're talking, so obviously our music track is way too long, right? So I know I'm going to want to grab the end of it to have it end video here, just so it kind of ends in a natural, normal spot and it makes sense. I'm going to zoom in and see what we can do here. I think I almost want the music to come in before the video actually starts. So I'm going to unlock my video track because I might move all of these over a little bit. So let's just see here. So I think what I'm going to do is unlock my voice over track. Let's grab all of our clips there. And I'm going to move it over to kind of like this beat over here. Let's see, where is this? So like right about there, I think. Let's try that. Make that clip a little longer. I'm going to just fade it in a little bit here. I think I just might add a few keyframes by holding Option or Alt and clicking on my game line here just to kind of start to get the sound that I want. Let's see. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected. I'm going to bring it down maybe minus 23. When we found music, it's... So I'm going to bring this out, fade it a little bit more here. And a quick tip here, I'm using my Shift key when I click on the little keyframe so I can move it perfectly, you know, back and forth, left and right. You could also move it perfectly up and down by holding the Shift key. So quick little bonus tip there for you. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. Suicide, addiction, self-harm. I don't think it should be that way. That's why Heart Support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and... Actually, there's almost like natural ending here. Let's just zoom in and maybe just try and cut the clip here and just see how that works out. I'm going to fade it out just a little bit at the end there. Let's say... You're allowed to be human, but you are not alone because we have each other. Welcome to Heart Support. Actually, that's not bad. Maybe I'll just leave that. Maybe I won't even grab the end of the clip, you know, because there might be some titles and stuff in the beginning and the end here that can round this video out because if I look at my paper here, Mr. Casey Ferris is up next to kind of finalize this video project here. So I'm going to leave that a little bit of space. I'll let him decide on how he wants to handle that. But one thing I think I need to do is... Like I'm okay with the way it kind of sounds in this quieter part of the song. I think it's okay where it kind of kicks in a little bit louder here once the video clips change. But I think it gets a little too loud on, you know, this section here. You can see it a little bit brighter there. So I think I'm going to add a couple keyframes and just quiet that down just a little bit. So let's just listen to a little bit of it and see what I think. And actually, I think this part can actually be a little bit louder over here. So let's boost that up a little. Connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. Suicide, addiction, self-harm. I don't think it should be that way. All right, so we're kind of built up here and then at this section here, it's a little loud. So I'm going to add a keyframe there and let's just put one here. And I'm just going to bring this side down a little bit and see how that sounds. Let's just see what we got here. And that takes a toll on our mental health. Suicide, addiction, self-harm. I don't think it should be that way. That's why heart support exists. We bring people to... So watching my levels here, it's up around. Minus 27, 8 dB. Let me just drop that back a little bit. And actually, before I even adjust it more, there's a few things that I do want to do to our music track here. One is a little bit of EQ work and then two is separated out a little bit, right? With our stereo spread effect. Let's go into Fairlight. We're going to see what that is. So jump over back into Fairlight. Musical notes at the bottom. On my music track, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to change this right here to EQ, FX, and FX. I'm going to come down to my EQ. And on my EQ here, I like to take my band 4, just widen it out with my middle mouse wheel or make your cue factor really small, and just make a little dip somewhere around here. I'm going to play through and just create a little dip there just to make some space for the dialogue because we've got a lot of the vocal in the dialogue that lives in this frequency range here. So let me just play through a little bit of that and see if we can make a little space. Self-harm. I don't think it should be that way. That's why Heart Support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. And this community has people who are trained to support you. All right. So can you hear the differences? Let's do a quick little before and after. Listen in. And encourage you so you can grow and heal, confronting your struggles. So it just takes some of those competing frequencies down a little bit. Okay. I think it helps just kind of punch the voice out a little bit, right, for the voiceover. So that's good enough for that. Now then the other thing that I like to do, which I mentioned is an effect. So if I come to my effects on my music track, we're going to come down to spatial, Fairlight Effects and Stereo With. That's the name. Stereo With. We're going to go ahead and add that guy on. And all you have to do is select the preset. So come on up here. We're going to go Max, Separation. And sometimes this works good on certain music clips and sometimes it doesn't. So you just got to try it out and see how it works. Let's do a quick little before and after, see if you can hear the difference. All right. So let me solo that because it'll be a little easier to hear it. So listen to how it pushes it out, especially if you're using headphones or you've got right and left speakers. Listen to how it pushes it out. I can even max out the diffusion there. So I'm going to go with that. I think that's, that's helping. Let's just listen to it now a little bit. Go back to the beginning here. Got our effect. I'm going to go ahead and jump back into the edit tab here and just play through, listen to it and see what we've got going so far here. Shift Z to zoom my entire timeline. Here we go. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. Suicide, addiction, self-harm. I don't think it should be that way. That's why heart support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. All right. I still think I feel like this is a little loud. Now I'm going to check it on my monitor speakers. Once I get done here, I can't use them while I'm filming because it just creates feedback and doesn't work. But I'm going to check it after because sometimes in my headphones, it sounds like too much, but on speakers, it doesn't sound like enough. So I'm going to lower it back just a little bit because in my headphones, it sounds a little too much, a little overpowering. But I'm going to check it on other speakers when I finish this recording up so that way, if it needs a little bit of adjustment, I'm going to go ahead and adjust it. So typically, it sounds louder in your headphones than it will on speakers. But I'm going to go ahead and make an adjustment, drop it back a little bit, and let's see how that sounds. And this community has people who are trained to support you and encourage you so you can grow and hear. All right. So I think that's all right. And at the end here, let's maybe just have it build back up a little bit. I don't know. Let's see how that sounds. So if I just add two keyframes, build the end up a little bit, not a ton, just a little bit. Let's see how that sounds. You're allowed to be human, but you are not alone because we have each other. Welcome to heart support. We have each other. Welcome to heart support. All right. Not bad. I'm going to move this point over a little bit. See. Because we have each other. Welcome to heart support. That would be kind of cool to add a little delay on there. Should we do that? Should we do a little delay on the end? Let it ring out a little bit? Why not? Why not? Let's throw it in there. So what I'm going to do is actually just create another track real quick. I'm going to create another stereo track. I'm going to jump over into Fairlight real quick and on my stereo track here, going to open my mixer up a little bit. I'm going to add in an effect. We're going to go to delay, Fairlight effects. Let's go with Echo. You can come select. Let's do slow swirling close. We will try swirling close. So now what I want to do is zoom in on my timeline here. And I just want to grab the last little bit of music here. I'm going to actually make a cut. And I'm going to copy this down into my other track by holding Option or Alt, click hold and drag it down. So now that it's in that track, it's going to be able to ring out a little bit. So let's just see if that sounds any good. It may not. I don't know. We're going to try it. Let's see. We have each other. Welcome to Heart Support. All right. So swirling close in the sound. Let's try large hall. I don't know about that. Let's try the slow crossover. I'm actually going to shorten it up a little bit. Shorten up my clip a little. Oh, what happened to it? I'm going to shorten up my clip a little bit. Get less of it there. Let's go with increase the wet dry mix here. That's just the amount of the delay there. And we may actually change from echo to delay. I'm not sure. Let's just, we're going to try it out here. This is how you do it. You just try things, see how it works, see how it sounds and then decide if you want to go with it. Welcome to Heart Support. I don't know. I don't know if I'm liking it. I got to be honest. I'm not liking it. I'm not liking it. So I'm going to get rid of that. Let's try the delay and just see if that one's any better. Barely affects delay. Default settings here. I'm just going to crank up the wet dry mix. Let's see how that sounds. We need to make that delay time longer. Let's go with, I don't know, half a second. Let's try that. See what that sounds like. We're going to drop the high cut back a little bit because I think those high frequencies don't sound so good. Let's try it. Not terrible. Not terrible. Is it great? I don't know. Let's just listen to it in context a little bit more. But you are not alone because we have each other. Welcome to Heart Support. So I'm going to drop back the high cut just a little more there. I don't know if I like it. I don't know if I would keep it, but I'm going to keep it in there for now and I'm going to pass this file along to Casey, who's next up on the list to work with some edits here. So if we just close down our effect, we jump back into the edit tab here. I'm going to zoom all with shift Z. So the last thing that I actually want to do here is I want to check my overall loudness levels for the entire project, right? I'm going to assume that this is going to be hosted on YouTube maybe and then they're going to link to it on the Heart Support homepage. So jumping back into Fairlight here, I want to make sure that the overall loudness, everything together meets the minus 14 left. We don't go over that, right? I like to be a little bit under it, but I don't want to go over it. So how do we do that? Well, what I can do first is to come up into my loudness section in Fairlight here, make sure we've got YouTube selected. If you don't see that, click on that, bring it down to YouTube. It's going to set our minus 14 lefts right here as the target that we want to meet. Next, you want to click on this guy right here, toggle open your automation controls, because if we scroll down to our bus one right here and you may need to, you know, open it up, make it a little bit bigger, grab the bottom of it if you need to. And you're going to see this icon right here, loudness history. And I'm going to turn that on. So I'm going to bring my playhead back to the beginning of my timeline here. I'm going to hit reset on my loudness and start. Now, as I play through this, we're going to see a line form on our graph down here. And that's going to tell us where is the overall loudness for our video. Now we want to be below this minus 14 lefts right here, right there. We want to be below that. We want to be below that. I typically aim for minus 16 or so. So that way I'm not too close. There's no chance of going over and the two loves different. Like you're not going to notice it'd be fine for YouTube. So let's just play through it and give it some time and we're going to see where our levels are falling for our overall loudness. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. So we can see we are down fairly low here. We're below, well, between minus 20 and minus 25. So we can raise that up and make it overall louder. Now, how do we do that? So what we can do is we've got a few different ways we can add on an effect to do that. I like to, when I'm mastering, this is kind of like mastering, right? All of your audio. Once you've edited it all together, you've blended it, mixed it and all that. You did your track effects, all that. The final process is mastering it and putting everything together. Right? We could do a couple of things. We could add just a touch of EQ to everything as a whole, just to, you know, make it sound a little bit, a little bit better. And to do that, I would open my EQ on my bus one. I might grab my point two here and give a little bass boost. Right? And then grab my point five here. I give a little high frequency boost. So let's just play through it and I'm just going to do that. And you can see the little bit of a difference that that's going to make. And then we're going to also continue to raise up the overall loudness of our video. So let's start with this and then we'll move on to boosting the loudness more. Okay, so that little bit of a change there. I think you can notice it. Let me just do a little quick before and after for you. Okay. Now I also boosted up the gain in the EQ here a little bit because we need more volume, right? For everything as a whole. So since we're boosting the gain on our main bus, we're going to bring the volume of everything up together, which is going to increase the loudness for us. So I can do it here. I can do it on my fader down here. I can do it in another effect. You've got a lot of different ways that you can do it. So actually, instead of doing it here in, you know, the, the EQ, let me just double click to reset that. I'm going to close my EQ. Let's go ahead and add on another effect that'll allow us to do that really easy. And I'm going to use the soft clipper to do that. So I'm going to go ahead and click on my plus for my effects. We're going to come down to dynamics, fairlight effects, and we've got soft clipper. Now in the soft clipper here, this is just going to make sure that we don't peek over, you know, my zero dB. We can adjust our threshold here, right? Maybe I want to bring it back just a little bit because I don't like it going too close. So I'm going to say let's go up to maybe minus one at most, right? So I'm going to play through the video and I'm just going to boost the output level here until my graph and my meter here gets up closer to that minus 14. Now, if I don't have enough room here, I can come down here in my fader, boost that up a little bit and that boosts everything up as a whole. So let's just see what we've got here as we try and boost it. We're going to start back at the beginning and let's just see what we can do. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone and that takes a toll on our mental health. Suicide, addiction, self-harm. I don't think it should be that way. That's why Heart Support exists. We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. And this community has people who are trained to support you and encourage you so you can grow and heal. Confronting your struggles and fighting for your mental health doesn't just change you. It brings change to everyone around you. It's okay to be broken. You're allowed to be... Okay, so we can see since we boosted that up, 3.5 dB, right? We can see our overall loudness now is going up. Now we're between minus 14 and 20. You can even look up here where it says our short is minus 16.7. Short max is minus 14.6. So that's not bad. Now if you have a max spike over 14, that's okay. Just the overall loudness, the integrated, right? Which is this number down here. That's what we're looking at. We don't want that to be over 14. So like I said, I like to be minus 16 or so a little bit below it. And I find that that works pretty good for YouTube. If you're uploading to a different platform, you may be shooting for a different target. You need to look and see what that level is. But let me just play through here a little bit more. We're going to make sure it's looking pretty good. And then we should be good to go here. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone.

We bring people together through the power of music to have genuine relationships that are authentic and vulnerable for the times that you need somebody to reach out to. And if you want to reset your effect too, you can always come up to, you know, you're allowing us up here to reset, start, and then let it start over, and see how it works out. When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger. Music is our home. These are our people. But beyond these walls, it's easy to feel alone. And that takes a toll on our mental health. Okay, so I think that's pretty good. I dialed my output back to four. Our integrated level right here is minus 15.4. I think that's pretty good. Again, I usually go around minus 16, minus 15 somewhere in there. I don't want to get too close, right? We have a little peak of a short-term max at 13.8. That's okay. It should be fine. We should not get any, you know, compression once we upload it to YouTube there. So I think that our mastering and our LUFS levels, checking our loudness and stuff at the end of the whole process here is good to go. So I'm going to go ahead and close that effect. And that's it. Well, I'm going to play through it now in its entirety at the end here. And you're going to be able to hear everything that we just did, all of the edits all together. And I want to hear what you think about how it sounds. So I hope you guys found this video helpful. If you did, let me know. What did you learn? Leave it in the comments down below. A big thank you to Heart Support for allowing some of us, some of us, resolve creators to team up with them and help bring awareness to mental health, as well as work on this awesome project, provide files to you guys so you guys can work alongside us and just learn some resolve together and support a great cause. So if you guys are interested in helping support Heart Support, we are trying to reach $5,000 and we'll get a $5,000 match to help people who struggle with mental health. And I believe that every $5 equals a one hour session that somebody can have with somebody who works with Heart Support to help work on their mental health. So big thing, big important thing here, I think that, you know, sometimes YouTube is great here, but we need to look at the bigger picture here. How can we help each other out? Not only with resolve, but when it comes to mental health, something I've struggled with and I'm sure a lot of people out there have struggled with and it's not an easy thing. So any support that you guys would be willing to give or support, you know, maybe it's even just finding somebody in your own life that needs some support, needs somebody to talk to, you could be that person that is there to support them and to help them through some mental health struggles that they may be dealing with. Sometimes we just need somebody to talk to, right? And again, a big thank you to all my other DaVinci Resolve creator friends as well as Heart Support for, you know, just working together on this project for a great cause. With that said, if you have questions, leave a comment down below, do my best to get back to you and I will see you for some more audio editing and just DaVinci Resolve editing in general in the next video. Alright, you take care, have a good one, I'll see you in the next one. Peace. Music When we found music, it changed our lives. We felt connected to ourselves, to each other, to something bigger.
