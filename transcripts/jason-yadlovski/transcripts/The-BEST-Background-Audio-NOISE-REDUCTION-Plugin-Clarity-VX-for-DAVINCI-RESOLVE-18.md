It's on and it just takes that noise right out of there. I didn't stop the video here It's just full recording here and the tractor still going if I turn it off Here's what it sounds like the tractor still going to turn it back on check that out. I'm amazed at how good this thing works I'm gonna show you a few other examples and then I'm gonna show you what the tool is show you how it works and It might be something that you're interested in because it is the best. That's right the best background noise reduction plug-in Then I've seen for different resolve. Let's get into it Hey, Betty yet. What if I'm on the tractor not mowing, but I got it going. It's pretty loud I mean, that's why I'm kind of yelling a little bit. But will this tool take out that background noise? Let's see what we got here it is with the background noise tool applied the clarity VX from waves this plug-in is awesome All right guys, we're back in the studio So what is the plug-in that I found that is just awesome at removing background noise and isolating your voice It's the clarity VX and clarity VX Pro plug-ins by waves. This video is not sponsored by waves I'm not getting paid to make this video or to talk about their plug-ins. I am set up as an affiliate So if you do go and buy any of the plug-ins using the link in the description below I do get a little commission on that kind of like an Amazon affiliate same type of thing I just want to share this with you guys because this plug-in is phenomenal And if you don't know who waves is real quick they just make a lot of plug-ins for audio stuff primarily in the music world in the music area for different kinds of Dawes and things like that when you're mixing and mastering music But those things can be applied here in DaVinci Resolve as well And I haven't seen really anybody talking about using the waves plug-ins in DaVinci Resolve So I reached out to waves and I said hey, I think your guy stuff is awesome. I've seen a lot about it in the music world What about we bring that into DaVinci Resolve? I think it can work and sure enough it does work and just off the bat too none of the plug-ins are free This one is on sale for 38 39 dollars totally worth every penny the pro version is gonna run you 249 dollars But the 38 dollar version does an awesome job and probably for most you that's all that you need So I'm gonna show you the plug-in show you how it works real quick It's super easy and then I've got a whole bunch of examples of different situations where this plug-in does an awesome job And it's different situations that you guys might be in like traffic Maybe you got people in the background talking maybe got wind noise Maybe you're using your GoPro and you got that wind noise you want to deal with so I got a whole bunch of examples I'll time stamp all of them so you can go through and check out which ones you want But first let's jump in and resolve. I'm just gonna show you the plug-in and how it works and then we'll get into the examples So I'm throwing my headphones so I can hear what's going on So let's get into resolve here and take a look at this effect So in order to add this effect on to a track, which is what I want to do in this case You want to come to the Fairlight tab? So make sure you're in Fairlight you want to open up your mixer So here's your mixer right here Then you want to go to the track that you want to apply this effect to you have effects right here If you don't see that for some reason click on the three dots you've got effects right here You want to make sure that that's checked on so I'm not gonna show you how to install the plug-in in this video But if you want to see that comment below I can make a video on how to get these plugins installed But I'm not gonna talk about that. It's already installed. I just want to show you how it works So effects and click on the plus I'm gonna come down to restoration VST and here I have a clarity VX Pro stereo and Clarity VX so I'm gonna go with the VX one which is the $39 one I want you guys to see that so it's gonna bring up the effect and this is what it looks like and literally It's one dial. This is the dial right here the farther up you crank it the more it's gonna reduce that background noise Now there are a few options here You've got two different types of neural networks that you can use to analyze your clip if you just hover over it It's gonna tell you what they do the broad one here is better for keeping voice detail and secondary speech And if I click on it we have broad too which is better for severe ambience and keeps mostly voices that are close to the microphone Which if you're vlogging or filming yourself or maybe you're in your studio You got some background noise. This might be a good option for you for the analysis type You can use single which sums up the right and left channels and just analyzes it together Or if you want to analyze your right and left channel separately click on this and it's gonna say double and you can see down The bottom there. It's just gonna analyze them both separately and process it that way I find single works out fine for me in almost every situation then you have with here So with is how why does the sound sound your headphones? Does it sound like it's around you or is it sound just like narrow straight coming for you? But essentially you can leave all these at their default There's even some presets up here. You click the little preset you can try out some of those if you want But really all you're doing is grabbing this dial listen into your clip and cranking it up So let's listen to the tractor clip in the beginning here, and I'm gonna crank up this dial and you can just hear the difference Here's what it sounds like Let's have that guys you ever run into this problem got some background noise. I got my tractor running back here Well, I found a plug-in that is the best that I've ever found for DaVinci resolve what that's crazy, dude crazy Crazy and you're gonna see in all these other examples. I've got how well this tool works Let me just do that again. Let me do that again. Here's me driving the tractor I'm gonna turn on this tool and you tell me Tell me what you think leave a comment down below. Hey Betty. Yeah, what if I'm on the tractor not mowing, but I got it going It's pretty loud. I mean, that's why I'm kind of yelling a little bit. Well, will this tool take down that background noise? What we got? What that's insane. Tell me that's not crazy, right? This is by far the best noise removal plug-in that I've seen for DaVinci resolve at this point It's better than any of the tools that are built into resolve and it's better than the other plugins that I've tried as well One of the things that I do notice is that there's not a lot of Artifacts and weird distorted sound to it now. You don't always have to crank it all the way up to a hundred You can leave it at, you know, 50% 25% Maybe you just want to lower that background noise a little bit. You don't want to completely remove it It's one dial. It really doesn't get any easier than this and this plug-in is just Fantastic and real quick just to show you what the pro version looks like check this out I'm gonna delete this off our track here and I'm just gonna go ahead and add in the pro version restoration The VST and the pro so the pro version basically gives you more options on how you can control What is being removed versus what is not so if you just look at it real quick down here? You have your main dial kind of like in the simpler version You can adjust the effect so that you're only pulling out the voice and you get rid of the background noise or You can go with only the ambience. Maybe you just need some background noise You're in the city filming you can get just the ambience. So if I play through here I'm gonna reset this to zero check it out. Hey Betty yet. What if I'm on the tractor not mowing, but I got it going It's pretty loud. I mean, that's why I'm kind of yelling a little bit. Well, will this tool take out that background? I Blown away this thing is so good and making this a little bigger in the clarity VX pro We do have some advanced controls where you can control the different frequencies You can again change the type of neural network You have three options here instead of just the two like we do in the more basic clarity vx effect You could change your your analysis to single and double change the sensitivity You can add in some reflections, which means a little bit of that original audio kind of like mixing them back together a little bit You have the ability to do that in the advanced version here You can change the processing amount so I can raise and lower the amount that's getting processed You can also adjust the gate So when is that background noise gonna cut out completely? You've got the option to adjust that right here and you can also adjust your levels a little bit on the end over here as Well as the width similar to how you can in clarity vx Now just because clarity vx is a lot cheaper than the pro version doesn't mean it's not as good this thing is fantastic So now that you saw what this effect is and how easy it is to use it literally a dial Let's go through all these examples. I'm gonna timestamp them all check them out comment down below with what you think Does it sound good to you? Is it the best that you've heard? You know something better there might be better ones or other good ones out there Comment below so we can help each other out and just really get rid of that background noise All right I was rolling to those examples and I will see you at the end of this video All right, so check this out. Here's another sample. We got the wind. It's blown right into the microphone here I don't have an expensive microphone on here. This is a fairly budget microphone. We've got some wind coming in You should be able to hear that so now if we throw on this effect this plug in here the clarity vx from waves Here's what we got do you hear any noise in there? Do you hear any wind noise any background noise anything like that? We're gonna have some more samples coming up So stay tuned. I want to hear your comments. What do you think? Can you hear it? Does it sound good? Does it not? Let me know what you think comment below All right, here's another example. We got a pretty windy area here You can see the flag blowing up over there and this is what it sounds like if we turn on the clarity vx I think it's gonna do a pretty good job cutting out that wind noise and just hearing my voice Here's if we turn it off you can hear the wind if I even turn into the window a little more now It's blown into the microphone. How's it doing in cutting out that wind noise and just getting my voice through All right Let's go see if we can find some traffic and get some traffic in the background I'm sure you guys film where it's a little noisy like that. So check it out All right, here's another example for you same microphone inexpensive microphone. I'm out here. There's a little bit of wind There's actually not any wind right now, but there's somebody riding a scooter around I don't know who it is, but they're going in circles and they're making noise so let's see if the clarity vx plug-in can get rid of that noise and Just make my voice be clear. So this is what it sounds like when it's turned on We've got the scooter riding by I almost got hit there. Did you guys see that? I almost got hit so so Let's see what the clarity vx could do here Alright is another sample that we got we got some cars passing here on the road I'm gonna try and find a busier road But here's it what sounds like without the clarity vx turned on and then I'm gonna go back and play it again With the clarity vx turned on But here's it what sounds like without the clarity vx turned on and then I'm gonna go back and play it again With the clarity vx turned on so it's turned on now to see how it sounds Here's another example. We got a little more traffic going on actually same spot as yesterday We got some wind noise got some traffic. This is with clarity vx turned on is it gonna take those cars out? And can we hear me clear without any cars in the background? You can even dial it back a little bit so you can hear a few cars which might work out good You want a little bit of background noise? Maybe I don't know maybe you don't but here's what it sounds like with it all the way Cranked up and just hearing my voice hopefully and blocking out those cars. All right. Let's get to the next example All right, here we are we're next to an air conditioner here. You should be able to hear this this guy's loud, okay? It's it's an air conditioner, right? So if we turn on the clarity vx, here's what it sounds like Does it make my voice clear does it get rid of the air conditioner? You tell me what it sound like on your end comment down below Joe we're in Hornet country not Ozy a little windy. I got a motorcycle off in the distance. We're in Hornet country Let's get out of here. By the way, how does the clarity vx sound on this? So here's another example for you. Maybe you're out on the street You're filming an interview filming something on the street and you're gonna have noise And people going by that's what it sounds like without the clarity vx But let's roll the tape back and play it again and turn on the clarity vx and see how well it sounds Let me know what you think comment down below So here's another example for you. Maybe you're out on the street You're filming an interview filming something on the street and you're gonna have noise and People going by that's what it sounds like without the clarity vx But let's roll the tape back and play it again and turn on the clarity vx and see how well it sounds Let me know what you think comment down below Let's say maybe you are outside in the jungle You're trying to film some cool animals or something going on and you got critters in the background making crazy noises like that Well, let's see if with clarity vx can get rid of that so that you can only hear me What we're talking about will the tape back roll it back Let's say maybe you are outside in the jungle You're trying to film some cool animals or something going on and you got critters in the background making crazy noises like that Well, let's see if with clarity vx can get rid of that so that you can only hear me What we're talking about. Let's roll the tape back. Roll it back. Here's another good example for you. I got machines working in the background here. They're pretty loud. They're busting up some concrete and I got to build some warehouses. So this is what it sounds like without the Clarity VX turned on. And now I'm going to turn it on and show you how it isolates my voice. I am using a microphone. That's a little bit better. So hopefully that kind of helps too because obviously the quality of your equipment makes a difference. So this is with Clarity VX turned on. And this is what it sounds like. I think you can get rid of all that construction noise back there. I think so. All right. Let's get on to the next example. Here's one for you. Anybody who's used the GoPro knows you got wind noise in the GoPro, right? So if I turn on Clarity VX, here's what it sounds like right now. Going, what am I going? 10, 12 miles an hour, something like that. Here's what it sounds like. We use the Clarity VX on GoPro footage. I'm cruising into the wind here. So we all deal with that if you use a GoPro. Lots of wind noise. Lots of wind noise. How's it sound? Comment down below. In the last final example here, we got some music playing in the background. Hear it? Let me go ahead and turn on Clarity VX right now. And we're going to see if it can get rid of that music in the background. Now it's still playing. Same video. Let me turn it off. And let's go ahead and turn it back on. Can it pick out just my voice and get rid of that background music? Now that is huge because I know a lot of people always want to remove background music if it's in a video and maybe they don't want it there. So that's how it works here. What do you think? Comment below. So that is the Clarity VX plugin here from Waves. Waves has a ton of awesome stuff. There's a link in the description below. You can go check out this plugin as well as the Pro version if you're interested in that. Check it out. Hey, maybe it's something that you're interested in and for 40 bucks, not even 40 bucks for the Clarity VX one, you can't go wrong if you need some high quality noise reduction in your videos. And they are always running sales. So if you're looking to get it and it's not on sale because none of these are cheap, man. But they do run sales a lot. So keep an eye open for any sales that might be going on. And like I said in the beginning, right now, as of the filming of this video, it's like $39 for the Clarity VX. So if you have questions, comment down below. I'm happy to answer your questions. Talk more about this plugin, the details of it, or anything else that you might want to know about when it comes to removing background noise here in DaVinci Resolve.
