So you want to learn about sound design. That is exactly what we're talking about today. You're going to walk with me through the process of coming up with a complete sound design for this little inspirational video that I've been working on. Not only are we going to talk about how to use the sound effects, how to find sound effects, but we're also going to talk about how we can tweak them a little bit and really make them our own when we put them in our video so they fit and sound the way that we want them to sound. Today's video is sponsored by Motion Array and the first thing I want to do is jump into Resolve. We're going to talk about the sound design a little bit and think about what can we add into this inspirational video to help make it feel a little more inspiring. So let's just jump in Resolve. Check this out. So we're in DaVinci Resolve here and this is our project. It's a little inspirational video I thought I'd put together and I've got a bunch of different clips here of all kinds of different things. I came up with a little voice over which we have in our voiceover track down here and then I've got some music in there where I've kind of had it you know fade up, fade down and that kind of stuff. So I'm going to play through this video once on its own here if you want to jump ahead, jump ahead, but just so you can see where we're at as a starting point and then we're going to talk about sound effects that I wanted to add into here to really help build out the feeling of this video. So here is the video as it is with our cuts, with our music and with our voiceover. If you woke up one day and could do anything, what would you do? Who would you be? Travel the world with friends? Spend days on horseback? Explore the wonder of nature. Camp in the countryside with the love of your life. Experience the fire from within. Stretch your creativity and connect. Perform at elite levels. Feel nature's power. Capture life's moments. Bring ideas to life out of nothing. Feel the adrenaline rush of man and machine. We're sitting in amazement of this beautiful creation. What would you do? And who would you be? So that's where it's currently at. Now I may adjust the music a little bit there too. I think it could use a little bit of tweaking, but let's talk about sound design. So when it comes to a project like this, when I see these different clips, I feel like there should be other sounds that I hear that are associated with that clip. Almost so that if I turned off the music completely, you would have the sound, the feeling of what the clip is showing. So once I look at a particular clip in my timeline, I start to think, well, what kind of sound do I want? And then I got to go find that sound, right? I have a library of some sound effects. You can get the free sound effect library from Blackmagic Design. Got a video on that if you're interested. But I'm thinking I want to go find all my own original sound effects to put into this particular video. So that's where a website like MotionArray comes in handy. So I'm going to jump over to MotionArray. I'm going to come on over to their sound effects section right here. And I'm going to search for what sound effect I want to look for. So in this case, that first clip made me think of breathing. So I'm going to type in breathing, and I'm going to see what comes up. Now we've got snoring, I've got different body sounds, a dog breathing. I'm just going to go through and listen to a bunch of these until I find one that I think works out pretty good and accomplishes what I want to hear for that particular clip. For example, breath. Now the one that I ended up picking is one of these ghost breaths. I don't remember exactly which one, but you're going to hear it once we jump into resolve. Now some of the other things that I would think to look for when I'm looking for sound effects here on MotionArray, if I jump back into resolve here, are just going through the clip. So with the eyeball, I might think of like just search for eye opening and see what kind of sounds come up. Maybe running to my friends, right, a group of friends in this particular clip right here, I would be looking for something like road noise, right, because she's driving in the car. The next clip, I know it's kind of like relaxing, maybe it's like some kind of environmental sound. For this one with the horse running, I want the sound of the water, right, and maybe I can slow it down or do something with it to make it sound and fit with the particular video. So I'm going to go through each one of my clips, the ice, for example, I want a sound like ice freezing, because that sounds like it'd be kind of cool. Maybe some wind, right, because in a clip like this, we see it's windy. So I want that wind noise in the background. Lava, I'll literally search for lava. But all these different things here you can search for, you just kind of have to have an idea. And then once you start looking for sound effects, you might stumble on other sounds that will actually work for what you're trying to do. Some of the other things that I searched for were waterfall, right, we've got tons of waterfalls here. I looked for lava. So if I just clear that looking for lava, like a volcano erupting, right, because that's exactly what is in the scene. So I could probably use a sound like that. Other things I would look for is wind. We've got all kinds of different wind noises. I would look for whooshes, right? Always need a good whoosh, right? And it can come in handy with our flicker effect that we might be trying to make there. What about when the people are painting, right? We've got people painting in some of those pictures, so I could type in painting, and we'll get brush strokes or brush sounds. And it's not something that's going to be overpowering in the video, it's just going to help sell the video or the visual that we see. I want to take a quick minute and thank the sponsor today's video, MotionArray. Have you guys heard of the MotionArray Hub? The Hub is going to allow us to use a whole bunch of awesome plugins right inside of DaVinci Resolve. On the MotionArray website here, if we come to the plugins, we can install the Hub. If you scroll down the page, you can see some of the kind of plugins that are going to be available once you install the Hub to find all these cool plugins in DaVinci Resolve. Go ahead and open up Resolve, come to your Effects Library, Open Effects, and scroll down to the bottom of the Open Effects, and you're going to see all of the MotionArray plugins installed right here in DaVinci Resolve. One of the ones you guys might find cool is called Page Curl. If I drop that on my clip, you can see it curls down the corner of my clip, kind of like it's on a page, and I can come and adjust it right here in the Inspector if I want to. And I can even keyframe this so it looks like the page is turning. I think MotionArray did a really good job with these plugins, and I think you'll find them easy to use as well. A big thank you to MotionArray for sponsoring today's video. Now let's get back into our sound design. Here, what I really like when I download the sound effects from MotionArray is that, one, it comes in a zip, so it's not too big, but then you unzip it and you get multiple sound effects as part of that main sound effect that you want. So I like that. We've got multiple options in the particular sound effect that I like. So I've already gone ahead and brought them all into DaVinci Resolve. In my media pool here, I have a sound effects bin, and I've brought in all the things that I want in order to make this video sound better and add in my sound design. So I'm just going to start with this first clip. I know I want my ghost breathing, so I'm going to find my ghost breathing. And right here, you can see I've got three of them, so I'm just going to preview them. I'm going to listen to them, see which one I think fits the bill for the sound that I want, and that's what I'll put in my timeline. So let's give them a listen. All right, they're pretty similar. Let's go with this third one here. Now I'm just going to zoom in. I'm going to watch my video here, and I want it to fade up, right, as the lights come on on the screen here. So what I actually want to do with this particular clip is I'm going to move it up to my sound effects track one, but I'm going to reverse it. I'm going to play it backwards. So I'm going to right click on there. We're going to go change clip speed. And I'm going to say reverse speed. So now I can change the length of my clip a little bit. And let's see where is it at its fullest? Right there. So I'm going to shorten up my clip. So it's kind of right there, then it starts to die off. And then I'm going to fade it in and fade it out a little bit just to help sell the effect a little bit more. And I also think I probably need to drop down the volume because it would sound a little bit loud. So I don't know, let's try minus 12. Let's see how that sounds. All right, not bad. Now I'm going to grab one of the other effects and just put it in the track below there. And I'm going to try it the way that it's supposed to go without reversing the clip faded in see what we got. All right, so maybe this one I need to reverse a tube just the way that the visual is looking with the way the sound effect sounds. I'm going to go ahead and reverse that. So I'm going to go change clip speed, reverse speed change. Again, I'm going to shorten up my clip. We're going to bring it in, find the brightest part of my clip there. We'll just move it up like this. And I think this should work out alright. So we're going to have that fade in, fade out a little, let's see what we got. All right, not too bad. All right, but let's see how does it sound with the music, right? Let's add in the music, see what we got. Okay, now we got to add in our dialogue, right to see how it sounds there because the music comes down. So let's hear it all together. All right, so it's definitely too loud where the where the dialogue is. So I'm going to just drop that back. Let's go maybe minus 17, see how that sounds. So I think that kind of works. And now I could even add on a little echo or a little delay to these two tracks, just to help it kind of like ring out a little bit. So maybe I'll do that in a little bit. But for now, I think it's in a decent spot to start with. Now the next effect here I have is the eyes opening and closing. So what I think I'm actually going to do for the eye opening is again, use one of those ghost breaths. So I'm going to use the first one here. Again, I'm going to reverse it. So change clip speed, we're going to reverse it. Because as the eye opens, I want it to make that that whooshing ghostly kind of sound, right? So we're going to go like this, I'm going to drag this down, we'll fade it in and fade it out a little bit, drop down the volume and let's see how it sounds. One day, you could do anything. What would you do? Who would you be? So I definitely think I want to add in a little delay there. So I'm actually going to just I could do it in the edit tab here, but I like fair light. So I'm just going to jump into fair light real quick. And on my sound effects track one, make my mixer a little bigger here, I'm going to come and add in a standard effect here dynamics now I'm not dynamics we're going to go delay. I'm going to go with delay. So let's just see how that sounds off the bat. What would you do? Who would you be? All right, we're going to crank up the wet the delay time a little bit. And let's see how it sounds. What would you do? I'm even going to push it up a little higher so we get a little more of the effect in there. All right, it's not too bad. I might actually try the echo. So we're going to come to delay fair light effects and echo just going to remove the delay. And on the echo here, we're going to go swirling close, we'll just see how that sounds. Not bad large hall. All right, I'm going to go with the swirling close for now, we're going to leave it at that. I'm going to copy that over boom, we're good to go back to the edit tab. So now I'm just going to work through each clip that I've got here, and we're going to add in some sound effects. So for this one, we've got somebody running towards a van with their friends, and I downloaded a sound effects that was a female crowd, short, happy, cheering, that kind of stuff. So here's what we got. All right, I like that. I think that's perfect. I'm going to set an out point by pressing O there, we're going to drag this down. I'm actually going to add it to a new track because I don't know if I want the delay effect on there or not. Now, when it comes to sound effects, you're probably going to add a whole bunch of tracks, just so you can do a whole bunch of different things with them. So I'm just going to keep naming these SFX3, and I'll just number them numerically as I go down. So now I'm just going to tweak this one a little bit, see how it sounds, and kind of just go from there. And I'm going to make sure I've gotten all of my audio on so I can kind of see how it kind of blends together a little bit. So I might actually extend this out a little bit, because we have the girl driving in the car here, but I'm going to fade it, right, so that it kind of fades out a little bit over time. And then for the girl in the back of the truck there, I want some of the road noise, right? So I know I have a road noise sound effect, here we go. All right, so I don't need a ton of noise. So I'm just going to press I there, we're going to come forward a little press O, going to bring it down into my timeline here. Again, I'm going to add it into a new sound effects track. So we're going to name this SFX4. And we're just going to try and fade this in and fade it out a little before and a little after each clip, or each end of the clip, I should say between the limits of the clip, probably going to drop it down in volume a little bit. Let's see how that's sounding. All right, it's a little loud, so I'll probably drop that back a little. And now we're into them just kind of hanging out in, you know, a wooded area there. So I do have some wind sound, so maybe I'll just throw a little bit of that in there, right? I'll just pick one. There's a little birds right there. So I'm just going to make it pretty quiet. So I'm just going to set some in and out points. We're going to drag that down. Because I don't need a whole lot, just need a little something to help sell the scene. So a little before, going to fade that in, I'm going to drop the volume down a bunch. So I'm going to grab my gain line, drop it down. Now, if you hold your shift key, you can be a little more precise there with how you're adjusting the volume. So I'm going to drag that down. I don't know, maybe minus 17. Make a little cut here. Let's just see how this is sounding. All right, that's too bad. It's got some birds in there. I'm kind of liking it so far. Next, we have a woman riding a horse. So I want the sound of water, right? Water splashing. And let's see what we can do with it. I do have a few water splash sound effects here. Here's what we got. So let's grab this splash number three. I'm going to see if maybe I can slow it down a little bit. I don't know. Let's say if I come in here, going to right click, change clip speed. And let's say I slow it down by like 50% change. See what that sounds like. I stretch out the clip too, because I slowed it down. So now it does sound a little not so great there. I'm going to come back to my change clip speed. We've got pitch correction. Let's not change that. Let's go ahead and hit change. So let's try that. So now I kind of want to line this effect up. Like I think it's okay. It sounds good enough. It's not too glitchy sounding, kind of like when it's full volume. We're just going to use it a little bit there. So let's see if we can get the horse's foot hitting the water, does it? Like right there. I'm going to move this ahead to about there. I think we also need a little bit of water kind of just in general splashing around going on, right? So let's see what else do we have here? Do we have other waterfalls? Let's see. I may need to get another effect, something that's like, you know, water drops maybe. Let's see maybe with the freezing ice. What does that sound like? So hey, maybe this would work here, the freezing ice. I don't know. Is it going to sound like water drops? I don't know, but we're going to give it a try. So I'm going to drag that in my timeline. I'm going to stretch it out. I'm actually going to drop it down again into another new track. I like to keep things separate a lot when I'm working with sound because it just gives you a better opportunity to either add effects later or do other things with, you know, a particular clip. So let's see. Here's what we got. I'm going to lower down our audio a little bit. So it's kind of just in the background, the water drops. Let's see how it sounds and see if it's something that might work for the clip. I think I can even bring the volume down more on there. Let's maybe make it minus 24. All right. So we definitely need another water splash before this one. So let's see which one I use on my timeline here. We used 03. So I'm going to come in and grab 02. I'm going to put this in there. I think we need it right in the beginning here. Let's just see how that sounds. So I probably want to slow down the other effect here. I'm going to right click, change clip speed. We're going to slow it down 50 percent, turn off pitch correction, change, and then I can stretch it out a little bit here and see how that sounds. So I think this one's even a little bit crispy yet. So I'm going to come in here and actually one thing I could do is just apply a little EQ on this clip to take out some of those highs. All right. So I'm going to select my clip, come up to my inspector, turn on my EQ. I am going to scroll down here, turn on band four, and I'm just going to bring this back a little bit. Let's try that and see how that sounds. I'm going to solo that track real quick just to hear it. All right. Let's try it. See what happens. Zoom out a little before. Here we go. So now it's a little hard to hear. So I'm going to push it back up because we cut out some of those frequencies. It's playing D's on horseback. I think that'll work. I think that's okay. Good plays to start. Now we've got these flicker effects, right? So I did have a quick tip Tuesday on the flicker effect, or if you didn't see it yet, it's coming out soon. So we want to add in a little sound to this flicker effect, right? And I'm thinking we're going to add in some kind of whoosh so that as the video flickers here, each flicker has a sound to it, right? So I'm going to find my whooshes. We've got a bunch of different whooshes. I'm just going to try a few and see which one I like, and then we're going to pick one. And I do want one that is pretty quick. So let's try this one right here. Come down, add it into another new track. And I know I need two tracks for the whoosh sound effect that I wanted to accomplish here. So I'm just going to create another track should be naming my tracks. So we're just going to take a second and name them real quick, going to zoom in on my timeline here. And we want to try and just line up these whooshes with the flicker effect that we have going on. So I'm going to again, put a little fade there. Now these are pretty short. These clips are only two frames long. So it's definitely a short, short sound. So I'm just going to do my best to line them up. You can use your period and comma keys to shift things little by little. And I'm just going to copy it and paste them back and forth for each one of my solid color effects here. And the reason I have two tracks is just so it's easier to overlap them. And you can go ahead and then even change the pitch of some of these. So maybe I'll keep these couple the same. And then as it gets faster here, in the next section here, I might bring in the fade a little bit more. I am going to have to change the volume of these, but we'll worry about that in a little bit, because right now I just want to get them in place. Alright, so I think that looks pretty good. Now they're going to be too loud. And I know that so I can select all these guys, open my inspector, come to my audio tab, and I can just drop down the volume of all of these right at once. So let's say I wanted to do a minus 13. Let's listen to it and see how that sounds. Maybe we'll just start right from the beginning of this clip with the horse and just see how the whole thing sounds together. It's been days on horseback. Alright, so they still sound a little loud, but I think the idea is there and the effect and the sound that I want is kind of coming together there. So I'm going to just go ahead and lower the volume of these guys. Let's drop it back. I don't know, maybe minus minus 20. Let's try that. And let's say on the last few here where it speeds up a little, I want to make those pitched lower so I can select all those. And I'm going to drop down the semitones here just a little bit, maybe minus four. Let's see how that sounds. Alright, maybe I don't like the way that the lower pitched sound. So I'm just going to go ahead and actually double click that to undo it. But I think that sounds pretty good. Might even need to lower the volume just a little bit more there. Alright. Sounds pretty good to me. Alright, I think we're going to go with that. So now I'm just going to cruise through the rest of my timeline here, go to each clip. I'm going to grab the sound effect that I think works for that particular clip. I'm going to fade things in, fade things out, put it all together in the timeline. And then I'm going to go do that so you don't have to watch me do all that, or maybe I'll speed through it here. And then we'll hear what it sounds like at the end and decide, do we need to make any more adjustments? Are we good to go? Where do we need to go from here? So off I go to put in some more sound effects. Alright, so I went in and added in a bunch more sound effects. We speed through that really quickly. Now you can spend a lot of time here playing with your levels, fading things in and out, making sure sound effect fits good, going back, downloading new stuff. It can be a really long and tedious process. But as you go little by little here, it just really makes all the difference when it comes to your videos. And in this case, there's a little inspirational video I was putting together just for fun, just to see if I could do it and see how it would come out. So now I'm going to just watch through it from the beginning here. You're going to watch it with me and we're going to decide, do we need to do anything else? Do we need to adjust some levels a little bit? How's it sounding overall? Is there anything else we need to do? Or are we happy with it? And I'm sure we're never or at least myself is never going to be quite fully happy with it. But let's just go ahead and watch through it here and see what it's looking like. Explore the wonder nature. Camp in the countryside with the love of your life. Experience the fire within. Stretch your creativity and connect. Perform at elite levels. Feel nature's power. Capture life's moments. Bring ideas to life out of nothing. Feel the adrenaline rush of man. Sit in amazement of this beautiful creation. What would you do and who would you be? All right, so not too bad. I do think you can still use some improvement. I think some of the music volumes where it goes a little bit louder. There's just too much of a difference there. I don't like the way that that's sounding. There's a few sound effects. I think I might adjust the levels on here. So I'm going to go back and kind of a little fine tooth comb go over it a little bit more here. But you get the idea of how we kind of built together the sound design by looking at the clips, figuring out what sound kind of makes sense, putting it in there, adjusting our levels, fading it in, fading it out, even adding on some effects. You could really go crazy with this stuff and take a sound. Maybe it doesn't quite fit the bill. You could add effects. You can change frequencies, EQ stuff, dynamics, squash stuff. You can do a ton of different things here to make that sound the way that you want it to really help sell your video. Now I'm almost done with my edit here. I'm just jumping in because I wanted to mention this to you guys that I've been editing with my headphones on. Now I'm going to go through and do a final pass through here with my monitor speakers, which you guys can't see. They're just out of frame over here. But I'm going to pull those out and see how it sounds because it always sounds different in here. I'm going to hear a lot more detail and a lot more sound than I will in monitor speakers or on something like my phone. So I like to check back and forth between headphones, monitor speakers in different places just to see how it's all coming together. So I'm going to do that real quick. You guys are going to hear the final thing after this and then I'll see you guys in the next video guys. All right, if you've got questions, let me know. Leave a comment down below. All right, peace. Spend days on horseback. Explore the wonder of nature. Camp in the countryside, the love of your life. Experience the fire within. Stretch your creativity and connect. Perform at elite levels. Feel nature's power. Capture life's moments. Bring ideas to life out of nothing. Feel the adrenaline rush of man and machine. We're sitting in amazement with this beautiful creation. What would you do and who would you be?
