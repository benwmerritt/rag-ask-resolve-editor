If you're looking to speed up your workflow here in DaVinci Resolve, MotionArray has you covered with their new plugin toolkit. This is a really cool set of tools that gets installed directly into DaVinci Resolve, so you don't have to go to the website, download things. You can just find everything you need right inside of DaVinci Resolve, and it speeds up your workflow by allowing you to just drag and drop these things right onto your clips or onto your timeline. Today's video is sponsored by MotionArray, and if you're like me, I'm always trying to crank out my videos here for YouTube as fast as I can so that I can get the good content out to you guys. And having tools and assets like these from MotionArray allow me just to drag and drop things really quickly, helps speed up my workflow a ton. Today I'm going to show you how you can download and install these plugins, and then where to find them in DaVinci Resolve, because it may be a little confusing, but I'm going to show you where it is. It's pretty easy. Let's jump onto the computer and I'll show you how it all works. First things first, use that link in the description to jump over to MotionArray's website. Once you hit that link, you're going to land on the MotionArray homepage, and we want to go to the new plugins section right up here at the top. So go ahead and click on plugins. Once you do that, you're going to come over to the plugins page, and here you'll see we have the option to download the plugin set up for either Windows or for Mac. Now I'm on a Mac, so I'm going to be showing you the Mac installation, but on a PC, it's going to be very similar. So keep this window open in your Explorer or in your Finder, in your Internet browser, download the version that you need, and then go ahead and install it. So if you're on Windows, follow the installation procedure for Windows. I'm on a Mac, so that's how we're going to do it here. You can see I've got it right here. I'm going to go ahead and double click it. It's going to bring up the installer, walk through the steps, and then it'll go ahead and install it for you. And while you're installing it, it may ask for access to your files. So you can go ahead and say yes, so that way you can put everything where it needs to go. Once the installation is complete, you'll get a message that says so, then you can go ahead and close that out. Now, once you've installed it, you come on down to your toolbar here. You may have to look in applications on a Mac, and we've got motion array plugins right here. You want to go ahead and click on that to open it up. Now, when it does open up, you're going to still have your web page open. You're going to see right here, it says motion array plugins, and it's going to tell you that you have to log in in order to be able to use these plugins and get them into the program of your choice. So go ahead and put in your account information and log in. Now, keep in mind, you do need an account to be able to use these plugins. You're not going to be able to use these with the free account that you can get at motion array, but there are lots of other good freebies on there. So if you want some other freebies, just search their site, look for the free assets, and you'll be good to go. Once you're signed in, you're going to get this message. You know you're good to go. You can just click OK. And at that point, you don't need your web browser open anymore. You can go ahead and close that if you want. The next step is to go ahead and launch DaVinci Resolve. So I am in Resolve here, currently in the edit tab, and I just have two random clips that we can try some things on in my timeline here. But in order to find these plugins, they're actually installed in DaVinci Resolve. So you want to come on up to your effects library. You want to come down to your open effects and then just scroll down towards the bottom and all the ones from motion array are going to say MA dash, whatever it is. I'm going to throw a list up on the screen here so you can see all of the cool plugins that are installed as part of this package here from motion array. And they're all drag and drop. There's a lot of cool things in here. Taking a look back in the effects library, we have blurs where we can do different kinds of zoom blurs. We've got channel mixers here. We've got different tones for color correction. We've got different cinematic looks that are just drag and drop. All we have to do, for example, if we want this cine style look on our clip, click, hold, drag and drop it onto our clip. Boom, there we go. Now we have that cinematic look right on our clip. There's some other ones down here. If we look, there's distort. You can do some distortion here. This is kind of cool. So if I drag and drop this on my clip, you can see now we've got our distorted image here. And if you want to make any adjustments to any of these, all you got to do is click on the clip. Come on up to your inspector. Make sure you're in the effects tab and then you're going to see the effects you have on your clip listed right here. And you can make any changes that you want. Now this works great to do it on an individual clip, but if you had a whole bunch of different clips, you don't have to apply it to every single one. You can actually use an adjustment clip on top of everything. So that way your changes and any effects you might want can apply to the entire set of clips that are below it. So if I just reset this clip, I'm going to get rid of these two guys and I'm going to go to my effects, grab an adjustment clip, throw it on top here, stretch it out. And let's say with this clip, I'm going to just cut it up in a few spots. So now let's say I go back to my open effects library, scroll down to my motion array assets and let's say I want that Cine style, I'm going to drop it on my adjustment clip. Now everything under that adjustment clip has that cool Cine style to it. And I don't have to apply it to every single clip individually. Now one of the cool ways that you can also adjust a lot of these effects is if we come to this little drop down right here and you select open effects overlay and you notice on the screen here, I've got like a little crosshairs, right? So if I click hold and drag that, it's going to change how this effect is being applied on my image. So you can adjust it here like this if you want for a lot of these effects, or you can just come right into the inspector and change the parameters in there to be whatever it is that you like it to be. And if you wanted to see a quick before and after of any of these color grades, for example, you can just come in your inspector and you can just turn it on and off and see what it looks like. Another one that's kind of cool here that can be used from some cool effects is this one auto volume metrics. So if I drop that on my adjustment layer, everything below that is going to have that really cool kind of light beam coming out of it look. That's kind of cool, right? And it might take you some time to create that by yourself. But here I can just drag and drop it on a clip or an adjustment layer, make a few changes in the inspector boom, and I've got a cool effect that I didn't have to spend a lot of time on. Let's say I just wanted to throw some film green on there, some film damage, right? I'm going to throw that on my adjustment clip. And if we play through it, you can see it's got the effect going there. And if I want to get rid of those crosshairs, because that's really just a way that you can adjust some of the effects, I'm just going to click this off right here. You can see turn it on, turn it off, play through, and it's got that film green damage kind of effect to it without me really having to do anything other than drag and drop. Another one that I thought is kind of cool is the lens flare. I like when I have a flare move across the screen sometimes. You even have auto light flares here. If I hover over it, you can see the auto light flares happening. Pretty cool. I want like a dreamy look. Maybe it's like an angel walking through the field here. Look at this one. MA Gleam. It's kind of got that angelic vibe to it, right? It's kind of cool. And it takes no time to just drag and drop it onto a clip. Now here's a cool one that I've had a lot of people ask for in the past and I didn't know how to create it. So here's one that Motion Ray has. It's called MA Page Curl. So check this out. I'm going to just drop this on my adjustment clip. And look, it looks like a page is curled up. And if I change the curl radius here, it looks like you're turning the page of a book. I've had a lot of people ask about how to do this. And honestly, without looking into it more, I don't know how to do it off the top of my head. I'm going to be honest with you, but with this drag and drop asset here from Motion Array, dude, I could just create this. You can keyframe this, right? So if I start here with it open, I'm going to put a keyframe. I'm going to come ahead a little bit and then I'm going to drag it this way. Maybe it goes something like this. Little page turn and it can turn into another clip or something, right? You also have a few gradients in here and some Luma Keen that you can use. You also have the timecode, right? You can put the timecode right on your video by just dragging it and dropping it on a clip. And then it's going to give you that timecode. We can change the size of it and make it bigger if we need to by selecting the clip and just scaling it up using our inspector. Sometimes you want that in there, right? You've got an automatic picture and picture. So you don't have to scale it down and do the work. You just come to this guy, drop it on your clip. Boom. You're good to go. There's a lot of cool features here in this plugin toolkit from MotionArray. Guys, if you're interested, definitely hit the link up in the description below.
