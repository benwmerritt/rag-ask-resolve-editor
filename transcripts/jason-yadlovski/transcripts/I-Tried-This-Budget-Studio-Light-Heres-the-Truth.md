Bad lighting can make even the best video quality look amateur. Let me show you what it looks like to have the proper light for your video setup. This is my new key light. It's a great video maker SD200B Pro Light. This thing is amazing and if even if you have a camera that is not the best quality camera, if you get your lighting right it's going to make a huge difference in the quality of your video. So today I just want to tell you a little bit about the great video maker light. They did send it out to me and I just want to share it with you guys because I've been looking for an upgrade and I am no newbie to great video maker GVM as you may know them because I actually have some of their other lights that I use in my studio all the time. I actually have a couple LEDs, one over here that's blue, one down on the floor here that's orange and then I've got a little rim light kind of coming from the back over there. Been using them a long time but lighting makes a huge difference and this new key light is no exception. These new lights from GVM are amazing. Let's take a look at them. So this is it. This is the light right here and I'll tell you GVM has come a long way in the quality of the products that they make. These lights I've been seeing around for a little while here. This one is a relatively new model and let me just tell you a little bit about it. I mean the things got some weight to it. It's got a metal case around it here. It feels really well built. It's very solid. It feels like you know this thing feels like a tank almost you know it's a little it's not too heavy. I mean it's definitely heavier than the light that I'm using now just to you know cover while I'm explaining this to you here but this light is it's nice. I was really impressed when I first opened this thing up and just felt what it feels like like if the build quality feels good and solid here. Now this is a Bowens mount so you can mount up any your soft boxes or things like that. Mount it right up on the front. One of the big things I noticed right away when I plug this guy in versus my old light which is currently up over here is that my old light is at full blast right now. It's at 100 percent. This one's a lot brighter than my old one is over here. So I like that because I've got more flexibility as far as being able to get more light out of this light here and actually I turned on another light on that side just to kind of brighten me up a little bit because the one key light here wasn't doing it enough. But this thing is bright. It's got a ton of output on it. It can change from white light to yellowish light if you want. Just starting at the front here. The LED on the front. It's great. I mean it's nice. It's compact. Everything's solid. It does have a nice little switch right up on top here that you can use to take off your Bowens mounts which is really nice. I like the bracket on here. This stand that they have is it's beefy. It's serious. You know it's pretty thick. You're not going to have to worry about it breaking or anything like that on all the screws here. It's got little teeth on there to like really make sure that it grips in so however you want to set the light you know it'll hold it there all day long no problem. You can just hold it right just like that. One of the other really cool things about this stand is right here you can actually put the light power box I'm going to call it right on the side here. So on the box itself there's actually a little little bracket right here and that slides right into here which is nice because you don't have to just let it dangle. You can hook it on there. It's out of the way and you don't have to worry about it just dragging all over the place right because that's some problems that I run into sometimes that you know this will come on hooked and then you're like oh what do I do like it's a pain right so that's nice I like that feature. Now looking at the back of this light here we've got a lot of things going on here and I'm just going to actually plug it in so that we can get a little bit of LEDs going here and I've got some B-Roller where we'll cut it in and show you exactly what this thing's looking like. I'm gonna go ahead and plug it in here I'm gonna go ahead and turn it on just got one easy little switch to turn on I'm actually gonna turn down this light because it's too bright I don't need that let's turn that down turn it off there we go turn it down to zero now some cool things on this is that I notice once I turn it on this side the GVM lights up that's kind of cool right adds a little style to it but it doesn't affect you know your lighting of your environment or anything like that it's just a nice little touch there on the back here we've got a bunch of buttons and knobs and dials going on here and we have a little screen that's going to tell us what we're going through with the different menus we've got a mode button we have a menu button a back button and a cool button where you can work the fan however you might want to you can turn it on more use it automatic you can adjust that however you want it'll cool itself down because the light does get pretty warm so it'll cool itself down and you know make it so that you can touch it a little bit easier it's not too hot or anything like that if you need to pack it way quick that said you can hear the fan just a little bit when it's over there I don't notice it too much when it's right in front of me yeah you can hear it but I would say in most cases it's not going to affect your your your sound your audio at all because as an audio guy that's important right gotta have good audio and you don't want interference from things like fans and whatnot so if we come to the main menu here we have different settings we've got a dmx setting so this light can hook up to a dmx system which is essentially like a lighting system where you can hook a bunch of lights together you can run whether it's software or hardware there's different ways to do it you can hook it up to a whole dmx system set up a lighting you know display if you wanted you can change the lights and everything from either a software like I said or a console that maybe sits in front of you so that's kind of nice you've got the option to work with that the the power plug right here it's it's it's in there really good too so you've got your power and then your dmx in and out so you can link a bunch of these together so you've got dmx settings that's the first thing in your menu there you've got a dim curve on how you change the curve we've got wi-fi settings where you can hook it up to an app there's an app on your phone that you can use and hook that up if you want we've got different settings and frequency settings and fan settings uh language settings and all that kind of stuff right in there and all that's there if you need to adjust anything now if we go to the mode button over here that's going to be where uh you're probably gonna want to spend most of your time right we've got three different options here we've got cct we have source and then we have effect so if i go to the cct that's going to turn on the light for us here and it's going to show us the amount of light right what percent light are we doing we do have 100 percent we have 10 percent right now it's like an 85 so let's go ahead and turn that down i'm going down to like 50 now we can change the color temperature of it so right now it's at 56 so if i shine it behind me 5600 there i can crank it up to 6800 or i can bring it down to 2700 so depending on what you want to do what color you're looking to match uh i'm going to come back to say 5600 right there it's like a whitish light oof it is bright let me tell you what it is bright so you can adjust the color temperature there however you want if let me turn down our our light there if we hit the mode button again we can come over to source and now there's different types of sources that we can use there's some presets in there like tungsten and different colors of light there's studio lamps you can do a sodium lamp it's got kind of emulations of different types of lights because sometimes if you're on set or you're in an environment or you're filming somewhere where you need to match the light of that situation this has a bunch of built-in presets that will mimic or match that color for you you may need to adjust it but overall it's probably going to get pretty close so you've got arc lamps candles sunsets sunrise you've got daylight overcast guys cool white so you've got a lot of options there if we come back to mode then we have effects so you've got a lot of different cool effects on here effects like lightning you've got cctv loop you've got candle you've got a bad bulb tv paparazzi explosions pulsing lights strobe lights fire fireworks and welding so a lot of lights nowadays have these kind of presets in there that you can use if you're trying to you know emulate something in your scene and depending on what you're trying to film it could work out really good to just have those in there you load it up you set it boom you're good to go all right we got the gvm light back up here i shut off my light over there and i mean this thing just throws a ton of light i also want to mention that it comes with this little spotlight cover here if you want to use that you can use that and i do currently have a softbox on there it's a i think it's an 18 inch octagonal box with grids on it so that's going to help direct the light a little bit more but if you take those grids off this thing is bright and if you throw on this as a spotlight i mean this thing is going to throw a ton of light it's super duper bright it was too bright for me to even use down in my studio without the softbox on it so if you are looking for a good light that you can use in your home studio kind of like i do here or maybe you want a smaller light that you can bring on set that's still got a lot of power to it this gvm sd 200 v pro level light is going to do the job for you i mean i'm impressed with it it's definitely better than the light that i was using before and this is going to be my main go-to key light from now on on my youtube channel here the quality of light is good it's easy to use it's durable it's built well and really i mean i think there's no reason that you shouldn't go out and pick up one of these guys so if you're interested in picking up this light i'll leave a link down in the description below right now i know you can get it on b and h for about 185 um and i'm gonna not sure on amazon i'll have to check that but i'll throw an amazon link down there too you can check that out but a big thank you to gvm for let me try this out i'm no stranger to gvm lights and i've watched them over the years just come out with better and better products that are better built the lights better the leds but everything's just better and i mean i'm still using like i said with the colors that i have here the little light back here so um those still work great i've had them for years i may have busted off a little bit of the barn doors dropping them on accident that's my fault but i mean the lights still work there's no problem with them they still do a great job and i use them all the time on my youtube channel here or if i have to go out and film like a little interview or something like that they work great the little panel lights are uh are still doing a good job so this new one i expect it to last me a pretty long time and uh yeah it's it's great i'm really happy with it so a big thank you to gvm for sending me out that light let me try it sharing it with you guys i'm just trying to give you guys the info you need to start creating awesome videos because lighting is super important you can even have a bad camera but if you got good lighting your video is going to kick some butt so thank you guys so much
