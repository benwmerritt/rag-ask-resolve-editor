If you are just getting started in Resolve, you're probably like me. You're sitting there, you're trying to figure out how to resize your clips or your objects. You can't do it other than using the inspector. You're like, there's got to be an easier way to do this, right? And you're right, there is an easier way. And that's what we're talking about in today's Quick Tip Tuesday. So without further ado, let's just jump right into Resolve and I'm going to show you this quick and easy tip on how to resize your objects. Let's check it out. So check it out. I'm in the Edit tab right here, Edit tab. So make sure you're there. Now, usually you have to come to the inspector right here. And if you want to change the size of it, right? You're new to Resolve. You're like, man, I got to do this. I got to move it over. I just want to be able to grab it and change the size of it. Here's how you do it. Come on to your viewer. Make sure you've got one viewer, two viewers. Doesn't matter. Come on down to the lower left-hand corner of your viewer. And right here, click on this little drop-down. And you see right here, we've got Transform. Click on that. And now that's going to bring up some handles here that we can just resize our element. We can move it around. We can stretch it up. If we grab the middle one's here, we can stretch it out if you want. You can use this guy to rotate it. So you've got a lot of options here on how you can quickly move it around and size it based on, you know, visually looking at it. Which sometimes I like to do better than jump it in the inspector and have to go precise numbers. And I don't want to do that. I just want the handles, right? You just want the handles, right? And once you're done, if you don't want to see the handles, you can go ahead and click that same icon. And it's going to turn off the handles. And now notice I can't click on it. I can't move it. I can't do anything with it. I can, however, come back to the inspector here and continue to change my sizes of things or rotation or whatever, any of this other stuff. You can still change that in the inspector. And a few bonus tips here. You can use some modifier keys like shift or control or command on a Mac to change the sizes of this thing. So if it's not going exactly how you want, or maybe I grabbed this middle point and I wanted to stay the same size, you know, or same proportions, I can hold shift and it's going to allow me to size it like that. Versus if I don't hold shift, it's just going to stretch out the sides. So you've got a lot of options on using those modifier keys to help change the shape of your object that you want to change. Now here's another cool example. Let's say maybe I've got this splashing paint and I actually want it to be coming out of this person's eyeball right here, right? I don't know why. Why? I don't know because it's cool. That's why. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to slide my paint over top. I'm going to select my paint layer here with the paint splashing. And again, I'm going to turn on this guy right here, which is my transform feature. Then I'm just going to scale it down and you might be thinking, okay, that doesn't look so hot because I can see the edges of it. Well, check this out. We're going to do this here. I'm going to come to my cropping section. I'm going to soften those edges a little bit. And then I'm actually going to come on down to composite and I'm going to change this to color dodge. Move this guy up to the eyeball a little bit. Is it perfect? No. Is it cool? I think it's kind of cool. And maybe I got to bump this over a little bit right there, right? Fader in. Check this out. There we go. We've got some bubbling in your eyeball there. Of course, you could do different blend modes. I mean, you can make this look way better, but hey, I thought these were two cool clips. So you can see how easy it is to use this transform feature to change the size of your clips, your objects, your text, anything that's on your screen here. You can use this transform and be able to change the size of it really quick and really easy.
