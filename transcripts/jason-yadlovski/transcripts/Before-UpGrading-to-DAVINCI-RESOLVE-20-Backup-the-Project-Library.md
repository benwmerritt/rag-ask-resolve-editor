Do not risk losing everything when you upgrade to DaVinci Resolve 20. That's right, you need to back up your project library before you upgrade to DaVinci Resolve 20 or any version of DaVinci Resolve. Here's how you do it. It's quick and easy. Check it out. So I just opened DaVinci Resolve. I get my project manager right here and I want to back up all of my projects at once because I don't want to lose anything or if I ever need to go back to version 19 for whatever reason because 20 is in beta, I want to have it as a backup just in case. So in order to back up your project library, come to your project library. So in this case, I'm going to use my local database, which has all my projects in here. You're going to go to the little I and then we're just going to go ahead right here and click back up. It's going to ask you where do you want to save it? I'm going to go and pick my project location. I usually put the date on there just so I got an idea of when that database was backed up. And then I'm just going to go ahead and hit save. You'll get this little message right here. So if you've got a lot of projects, it might take a little while. I have literally hundreds of projects. So let's go ahead and hit backup here and see how long it takes. Once the backup's complete, you'll get this message. Just go ahead and click OK. Now that took not that long a minute or two at most. And I've got like literally hundreds of projects in here. So now if I check out my file directory here, it is right here. Now with my hundreds of projects, this backup file is only 1.61 gigs. It's not really that big. And all of your projects are all backed up at once there. You've got it all in the database. You don't have to do projects individually. You've got everything in your project library here backed up. Now if for example, you needed to restore this project library, here's how you do that real quick. In Davinci Resolve and the project manager, you want to come to this section over here. If you don't see it, click on this little icon to open up your libraries. And you've got this icon right here. You can go ahead and click on restore. Then just go and find your database. And then you can load it up and you'll be good to go just in case you ever need to reload that database. So always back up before you upgrade to any version of the DaVinci Resolve. You might want to do other backups like maybe backing up your power bins or other assets that you might have that are used all the time in Resolve for you. So you want to back those up or make sure you've got them somewhere else just in case. Now I've been going to the beta versions of DaVinci Resolve as soon as they come out for the last, I don't know, every version, I guess, since like 16 and or maybe even 15. And I never have any problems. I'm running on a Mac. The Macs always seem to work out great. I rarely have problems. Sometimes there's little bugs, but I never lose a database or lose projects or anything like that. But it's always good practice just to back it up just in case because you'd rather be safe than sorry. Now that I'm all backed up, I'm going to make some DaVinci Resolve 20 videos for you guys getting there and play with it because a lot of cool stuff there. I'm excited. So I'll see you in the next video.
