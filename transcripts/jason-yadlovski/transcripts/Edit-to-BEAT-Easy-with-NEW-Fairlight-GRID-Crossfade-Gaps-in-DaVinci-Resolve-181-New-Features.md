Yo, what's happening guys? We are talking audio updates here in DaVinci Resolve 18.1. We're talking about how to cross-fade over gaps in your music, and we are also going to talk about how to edit to the beat using the new grid feature here in Fairlight in DaVinci Resolve 18.1. It makes it real easy for you, and no, you don't need to know anything about music. You don't need to know how to figure out beats. You don't got to know any of that. Resolve is going to do the work for you. So this is a super handy and sweet feature to help you edit to the beat, so it looks a little something like this. So the first thing we want to check out is how to cross-fade our audio over a gap. Pretty cool here. So you need to be in Fairlight. So if you're not there yet, click on the musical notes at the bottom. Now let's say I've got a gap here between two of my songs. I've got one song on the left, one song on the right, and I need to have a gap between them for whatever the reason, and I want to cross-fade that gap. So check it out. Here's what it sounds like with these two songs, and I want to blend them together, but I need that gap for whatever reason, right? So here's what we got so far, and then I'm going to show you how to drop a cross-fade on the gap. Okay, so two different styles in music, right? Now in order to drop a cross-fade on that gap, use your range selection mode right here, letter R if you want to use keyboard shortcut, select the section that we want to drop the transition on. You make it a little bit bigger there, and then you want to come on up to your trim menu, come on down to cross-fade selection. You can use the keyboard shortcut, which you'll see at the right hand side here, but I'm just going to go ahead and hit cross-fade selection. Boom, it's going to drop in the cross-fade there and fill the gap for us. Now listen to this guy and see what it sounds like. Pretty good, right? I mean, it blends them together real nice, takes care of that gap for us, and then we can also come in here and make any changes if we want to. You know, you might want to change the way they blend or fade together. You can change the transition length a little bit by grabbing the ends if you want, bringing it in and bringing it out. Real quick, real easy, and actually it does a real nice blend between the two songs there, putting them together and dropping that cross-fade over a gap. So super handy, super useful, dropping cross-fades on gaps here. Now let's jump into checking out the new grid feature here and how we can use the grid to help us edit to the beat. Even if you don't know anything about music, that's fine, don't worry about it. Resolve can do the work for you. Let's check it out. In Fairlight again, you need to be in Fairlight, musical notes at the bottom. In case you left the Fairlight tab, jump back in there. So let's talk about where can we find these new grid tools? Well, if we come up to the top left of our timeline right here, we've got the new grid tools. Go ahead and click on that. Now a few options in here, you can turn on the grid by just clicking this first guy right here. We can allow our playhead to snap and our clips to snap to this grid that we're creating by turning this on right here. We can adjust our grid by time or time code if we want. And when it's set to this, you can see down here resolution, we've got different options on how we can have this grid laid out right by seconds by half a frame by quarter frame. So you can use it that way if you'd like. Now the way that you're probably going to want to use it when you're trying to edit to the beat with music is using the musical note right here, which is going to give us more options on getting the beat of our music, right? So we can edit our footage to the beat of the music kind of like this. So coming down here, you've got a few options when it comes to how you can edit to the beat and the grid lines that will show up based on the beat of your music. So you've got resolution right here, you can click on that, you can do it by bar, half note, quarter note, eighth note, sixteenth note. Now if you don't know anything as I'm hitting stuff on my desk, if you don't know anything about music, just pick the quarter note and that's going to be a good place for you to start. Now when we take a look at the time signature here, this is how was the music created, what is the beat of the song? And typically if you don't know anything about music, a lot of songs and music are going to be in a 4-4-4 format. So it's like 1-2-3-4-2-2-3-4-3-2-3-4, okay? So you don't need to know that it's not necessary in order to be able to do this, just pick 4-4, most likely you're going to be okay. And we're actually going to have Resolve do some of the work for us here in a second. Then you've got tempo right here. So you can select the tempo for your music if you know what that tempo is. For example, if you jump on something like Epidemic Sound or maybe Artlist or something like that, they're going to tell you what the beats per minute are and you can plug that in right here. But if you don't know that and an easier way to do it is just have Resolve do the work for you, which I'm going to show you in a second here. And start song, you don't need to worry about that for right now. So here's what we want to do. We want to come down into our timeline and with our grid turned on, we're going to zoom in a little bit here and I want to select in, in, in and out range, right? So I'm just going to say I want to start right here at the beginning of my song and I'm actually going to re-extend out my song here because I made it a little shorter. So we're going to extend this guy back out. So I'm going to come to the very beginning of my song with my playhead. Now we're going to select an in and out range and I'm going to do that by just hitting the letter I for an in point. And then I'm going to play through it a little bit. And if you know how to count some beats, you can count some beats, but if you're not sure how to count beats, don't worry about it. Just jump ahead a little bit and you can hit the out point and we're going to get resolved to do some of the work for us here. One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, boom. All right, so that sounds good. There was a couple bars there at four, four. Again, you don't need to worry about that. So let's just say you set your in and out range and you're like, all right, now what do I do? Let's tell resolve to set the beats per minute based on this song. So just come on up to your range where you selected up here, you can right click, and then come on down to set tempo grid BPM or beats per minute. Go ahead and click on that. It'll bring up this little window right here. And you can set the number of bars if you want. And then go ahead and hit set tempo range. And now notice it's doing it from the playhead here, right? So that's where it's starting. So I'm actually going to move the playhead back to the beginning of my audio clip. And then I'm going to do this again. So go ahead and exit out of this, I'm going to bring my playhead back to the beginning of the clip. And what we can actually do is we can either redo the set grid tempo or just go ahead to set tempo grid start. And that's going to shift the grid for us. So it starts with the beginning of the song, which is what you want to do. And if I zoom in even a little bit more here, you notice my music doesn't actually start to right there. So that's the point I want to use. I don't want to use the very beginning because we have just a little bit of dead space. And that could throw off your beats. So again, come up to the top right click, set tempo grid start. Boom. Now if I zoom out, you're going to see we should be hitting where all the beats are, right? Let's take a look and see how it does. Now just watching it real quick, it looks like these bars are hitting right on the beat. Okay, so now how do we use this to help edit our footage to the beat? Now if you're working with audio, it's easy to drop a piece of audio in here and the audio will snap to these grids, right? But if we've got some video, it's a little bit tricky because you can't see these lines in the edit tab. And we don't have as many tools to work with our footage here in Fairlight, but we can still do it. Let me dump some footage in the timeline here and I'll show you how to do it. All right, so now how do we see our footage here in Fairlight, right? I dumped in my footage, but I don't see it here. How can I find it? Well, if I come over here to my timeline view options in Fairlight, I can click on this little guy right here, which is going to show my video tracks for me. So I turn that on, you're like, Jay, I still don't see it. Here we go. We got to make our tracks a little bit smaller here and kind of scroll up to the top because we've got our video tracks on the top of our timeline here. So we've got our beats in here, which is great. And we want to edit our video to the beats. So let's say I want each one of my video clips to be, you know, maybe, maybe two beats before it changes. So I can use my playhead. And actually, I'm going to come up here and hit mark and clear my in and out points and zoom in. Now I can use my playhead to jump to these different points in the timeline where my grid is, right, which is where the beats are in my music, right? Now, if you drag your playhead, it does snap there, but it's kind of not great. But if you just click on it and just do a one click thing, it's going to snap right to it for you. So let's say I've got my first clip here and I want to go two beats, right? When I'm going to come here, I'm going to select my video clip, and you can use your keyboard shortcut for the razor tool, which by default, I think is command or control B, I think, but I've got mine set up as S. So if I just hit S, boom, it's going to make a cut right there. So now that I made my cut, I need to delete the next part there that's highlighted. So I'm going to use my delete key to ripple delete that clip. Boom, it's going to bring up the next clip. And let's say I want to go ahead another two beats on this clip. So that would be here, I'm going to make another cut and you can use the scissors right here if you want, but the keyboard shortcut is going to be quicker and easier for you. I'm going to hit highlight my clip, I'm going to hit S. Again, click the part I want to get rid of, ripple delete, move ahead one, two more, select my clip, S, ripple delete on the part I don't want, jump ahead, two spots again, use my razor tool to cut, select the clip I want to get rid of, get rid of that. And we're just going to keep going through and do this for as long as we want to have our music match with our cuts in our video, right? So that's just how we can do it. And make sure when you make your cuts that you select your video clip, otherwise you're going to be cutting your audio clip, you're going to be ripple delete and audio, you don't want to do that. You can always lock your audio tracks too, so you don't actually accidentally change them. If you click on the little lock down here, just so you don't actually change things. And then you wouldn't have to select your your video clip, but you just want to be careful, you don't mess things up and move things around that you don't want to be moving. So I'm just going to go ahead and finish up the rest of this, we'll take a look at it. Alright, so I got all my cuts where every two beats. So let's go back and I'm going to pop out my viewer here so we can see it a little bit bigger. And let's just play through our clip here. And let's just see how it sounds. Just shrink it down a little bit, you know, so we can see what's going on in our timeline here. Slide this guy over, so you can see it. All right, let's play through to see what it looks like here. Here's what we got. That's awesome. Super easy, super quick there. If you've got video clips, you just want to edit to the beat and hopefully they continue to improve this to make it even quicker and faster to just drop it in and maybe automate some of this in DaVinci Resolve. But that's how you edit to the beat using the new grid feature. Super easy, does a lot of the work for you. You don't have to actually pick out the beats yourself and all that. So great tool here in DaVinci Resolve, the grid. Guys, Blackmagic Design, you guys are awesome. I can't even say that enough. I just can't say that enough. Love you guys. So there you have it. Two more awesome features here in DaVinci Resolve, 18.1 Blackmagic Design. You guys are awesome. You're doing fantastic. And you just keep making this program better and better for us. I mean, I think I say that in every video. I can't, you can't say it enough, right? If you guys have any questions on these new Fairlight features, drop a comment down below. We're going to be getting into some more cool new features here in Fairlight Automation. That's something I've been wanting to get into for a while, make a video about it. And I just need to spend the time to actually put together a video for you guys because it's really handy. It's really helpful. And I think that you guys would benefit a lot from knowing how to use the automation on your audio here in Fairlight. All right, guys, with that said, that wraps up this video. Look forward to seeing you in the next one. Peace. Bravo Blackmagic. Bravo. I can't say it enough. And hasten. Need a drink. Check this out. I had to use a pink bottom on my water bottle here. Why? I don't know. I couldn't find the black ones. And I live with all women. So, you know, I got a lot of pink and purple around here. It's all right. No shame. No shame. But yeah, you know, what are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? All right, I'm off to edit. See you in the next one.
