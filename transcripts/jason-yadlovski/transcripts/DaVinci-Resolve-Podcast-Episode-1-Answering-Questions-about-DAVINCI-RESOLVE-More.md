What's going on guys? So I had an idea for a new little series here where I'm gonna go through and answer some of your questions. Now I go through comments every day on my YouTube channel. I try to help everybody out and answer as many questions as I can and if I don't know the answer try to point you in the right direction or I'll just flat out tell you I don't know the answer right. My idea is to just kind of make videos about answering your questions because a lot of you guys have the same questions and you don't necessarily look through the comments on a video. So that's what this series is gonna be about just kind of looking through our comments here answering questions that you guys have that you've left on videos and really it's just another way to try and help you guys out and answer the questions that you have here in DaVinci Resolve. So we're just gonna go ahead and jump on YouTube here and start looking at some comments here and we're gonna answer you guys questions. So if you're not familiar with how YouTube works on the back end right anytime you get a comment on a video it all comes into your comment section right here and we can see what video it was on if we look over here on the right and we can see the comment and then we can reply to the comment right there. So that's kind of how how the setup works here. So let's just work through these and see what we got and see how we can help you guys out today. First one, Systems Master Computer Training. Thank you. Love when people say thanks. I'm always gonna jump on there and just give you a little thumbs up, a little smile, face something, say thank you for watching. I'm gonna go ahead and give you a heart too and a thumbs up. Alright so here we go from Songbird. Hi Jason. I have updated Resolve after taking a year-long break from video and I can't get it to connect to my database. I think it might be because my database projects are under the guest user with the path. I hit add a project library navigated to the folder containing the database and entered the database file in name. Resolve created a new folder called ResolveDiskDatabase in the same folder as my database but with no project in it. I tried selecting the database folder itself and under the add project library it just recreated a ResolveDiskDatabase folder inside the database with no projects in it. I can see my projects when I navigate through the database through File Explorer but I can't get them in to Resolve itself. I would appreciate if you could shed some light on the situation. Thanks for the informative video. Really wish I'd watch before upgrading. So one of the things that I'm thinking if you've taken a year off I don't know if you were on version 16. DaVinci Resolve 16 but every time they release a new updated version you've got to update the database. So if it's on 16 maybe it can't go from 16 to 18 or whatever version you last use maybe it can't update itself all the way. So I mean I think the best bet might be to just create a new database and just kind of start from scratch there. You should be able to update, upgrade it I would think but if for some reason you can't maybe that's why because you were on an older version of Resolve that's you know too far back and it can't take the version of the database you have and upgrade it to the current version 18 point whatever it is. So maybe that's why. So that's your answer there I'm gonna go plug this into here and we'll be right back with the next answer. Alright next one we have here from LP. Can this trick be used to sync multi-language streams got by ripping two different DVDs of the same movie. I'm trying to convert them in one MKV file but even if I fix the delay of the language of A language at the beginning it then drifts from the main audio. Do you have any advice thanks in advance. So this was on a video called Sync Audio Hack. How to manually sync video and audio in the media tab. So I think you can probably sync multiple different streams of audio with your clip. I'm not sure I haven't tried it so I think you can in the media tab there. So let me just jump over to Resolve here. So if you're in Resolve and you are this in the media tab you can select a file from your media pool here select an audio track and sync them together you can do that and I don't see why you couldn't do more than one because for example if I look at a video clip any random video clip and I say clip attributes right if I've got audio synced up we're gonna have embedded channel 1 and embedded channel 2 and then we would have synced audio 1, synced audio 2 and I don't see why you couldn't have more than one synced audio track. So that might work you could probably do it that way. I don't know you have to give it a try and find out. So I'm gonna go ahead and say that I think you could be done you just got to try and find out. A lot of times comments that people might have you know my suggestion is well just give it a try and see if it works out for you. So that's what I'm gonna tell LP here. So just following up on this one too they said do you have any suggestions because our audio drifts right I sync it up but then the audio drifts a little bit and it doesn't match up. Maybe it's like a frame rate issue or something like that where the audio just it's not lining up. The only thing you could do is just line it manually then and sync it up in your timeline and shift it a little bit as time goes on right in parts where maybe there's no dialogue you can shift it back a little bit. That's probably the best way that you could handle that so I'm gonna add that in there too. Alright there we go I'm gonna go ahead hit reply little heart for you and a thumbs up. Thanks man. Alright the next one we got a comment on a DaVinci Resolve short I lost my audio clip match frame to the rescue thank God for this. Match frame is awesome if you don't know about match frame I do have a video on that you can check it out but comes a real handy when you accidentally mess up your clips and stuff so we're gonna go ahead and say thanks for watching and give you a heart and thumbs up. Alright Jarrah what's up here Jarrah commenting on the Samsung Q9X video which is this microphone right here which is awesome it's a fantastic mic appreciate this candy review of the Samsung Q9X maybe my first XLR mic as a hobbyist I'm using the DJI wireless mic system the dual kit in case in a case is so convenient and flexible and a road video might go to and two recorders in a zoom H1N and an F3 so XLR being my next step forward so if you haven't gotten into XLR mics yet they're awesome I mean there's some fantastic microphones granted they do get a little more expensive you do need a few more parts got the audio interface down here and whatnot but the XLR mics are awesome there's just so many great ones out there and I think an XLR mic for you know a nice upgrade would be a nice upgrade to what you've got there not that those mics are bad they're fine too but depending on your situation if you need a microphone like this one it's a fantastic job and that's why I'm using it now because I like it why not right and you get a little heart and thumbs up. Alright moving along looks like we've got the same person commented on to same video here same video with no audio and resolve I've got a couple videos if you got no audio and resolve you're having problems so that's what those videos are about we got he's saying I'm new sub that's awesome so I'm gonna say thanks for the sub welcome to the community I really do appreciate all you guys and everybody who jumps in you know subscribe to the channel and just watch his videos and comments and stuff it's awesome I can't thank you guys enough for just watching the stuff that I put out there and I'm just glad I'm able to help you out so I really appreciate everybody who does subscribe to the channel so for that you're gonna get a heart and thumbs up and then the same person said most thank you most grateful it worked and I'm gonna say awesome glad it worked actually awesome glad you got it working and a heart and a thumbs up. Alright this next comment here was his Maddy Puff had an old video about audio visualizer so once I load the audio file into the modifier it locks the size at zero which makes my image not visible and does not animate. Now I haven't tried out this feature effect whatever you want to call it effect I guess I haven't tried it out in a really long time I made this video probably at least two years ago if not more so I'm not really sure why they might be having a problem so I'm just gonna be honest with them and say I haven't used the effect in a while I'm not sure why it's not working and just for dropping a comment I'm gonna go ahead and give you a heart let you know I appreciate you dropping a comment. Next comment on the Wednesday morning behind the scenes short thank you for your channel but I don't like shorts. Okay that's cool hey everybody's entitled to their opinion no problem thanks for watching the video though so I'm gonna say thanks for watching even though you don't like shorts I appreciate you and I'm gonna go ahead and give you a heart because I appreciate you dropping comment. Next we've got a video on the best sound from the Blue Yeti this is a probably I think my most viewed video actually which has nothing to do with the Venture Resolve actually has to do with the Blue Yeti microphone so we got Gray here says super helpful and concise explainer video thanks Jason so I'm gonna say thanks for watching man I appreciate it and we'll give you a heart and thumbs up. Next comment on my make dialogue sound better part two it says great video Jason from Benjamin John Development great video Jason gave me the confidence to jump in and have a go using Fairlight question when in the process when in the process do you make all of these audio edits do you drop your clips into the media pool put them together then edit the audio before editing and cutting the content or the other way around what are the pros and cons so what I'd like to do when I'm working with audio is essentially I'm gonna edit together my video first I'll have you know my my video track with audio or I'll sync audio up from an external mic I'll put it in the timeline I'll edit my video and then once my edit is done it's looking good then I'll go back and start working with my audio so I typically only have myself talking so I have got all my audio in one track I'm usually in my studio here for most of the videos I make on YouTube if I'm out and about and I have different situations where the audio might be different then I would put that audio into different tracks so I can work with it in different ways maybe I need different EQ different you know settings or effects or dynamics whatever it might be it may vary depending on my location so it depends on you on your clip so for example this I'm all recording off of here it's gonna be one long track because everything's gonna be the same situation I'm in my studio here right so kind of depends on on your situation but what I'll do is I'll like I said edit together my video and then I'll go back and start working with my my audio I will make sure that I've got good levels you know just kind of from the start there when I'm putting my audio clips in before I start chopping stuff up just so that I can hear it good enough I'll aim to get my audio levels from a dialogue and that minus 10 minus a DB range somewhere in there and I'll leave it there until I edit the entire video or get most of it done and then I go start to work with the audio I'm gonna do a little EQ I'm gonna dump well actually back it up to double check my levels then work with the EQ then do some dynamics and add effects or whatever else you know I might need or want to do with my audio so that's kind of in a nutshell what I would do and then I'm gonna go ahead and reply to Benjamin right here alright reply we're gonna give you a heart and a thumbs up thanks Benjamin alright next up why your DaVinci Resolve 17 voiceover is not working right we all get frustrated right if your voiceover is not working you can't record right in a resolve nice so Ask Film School said awesome it was really great full it was really grateful I'm just gonna say thanks for watching man alright next comment we have here is on a video called make your dialogue sound better part one this is where I talked about setting levels and some other things I forget I'd have to look it up but the question is from Victor is could you please make a video about how to edit video podcast with three plus people mute sections when one person is speaking and other edit tips and tricks to edit audio on DaVinci so I've got tons of videos on editing your dialogue in DaVinci Resolve I think I cover pretty much anything you would need to do as far as dialogue and audio is concerned when you are making a video podcast and that's kind of what I'm doing here little video podcast I think what you want to do ideally is get I don't know what kind of microphones or set up you're using but if you've got microphones like this one that's a dynamic microphone it's gonna be real close to me it's gonna pick up mostly just me if there's anything going on around the microphone or even a person sitting across the table a microphone like this one right here is not gonna pick up too much of that other person so I think that's the first thing is getting good microphones that are gonna work for the situation that you're in now if you are picking up extra noise and things one of the things that you can try is to use a gate to drop off or essentially mute the audio in between the different people speaking so for example when you know person number one is speaking and person number two is not even if that number two microphone is picking up the other person speaking you could probably set a gate around you know minus 35 dB minus 30 dB I don't know and it might cut out that other person so then you don't even have to go through and mute it all or drop levels or keyframe or anything like that so I would try that using a gate to see if it will work for your situation and I'd also if you're gonna be doing this podcast long-term I would just look to get microphones and equipment that are gonna help make the job easier for you instead of using something like for example my Blue Yeti which picks up everything even when you have it on a cardioid pattern it picks up a ton of stuff and you know that could just sound messy and sound dirty but if you could get you know three dedicated microphones for each person and then you know have a dynamic microphone like this where it's gonna really eliminate a lot of that extra noise and picking up the other people make sure you set your levels properly while you're recording you know think about all those kind of things and I think that will help you in addition to maybe using a gate or expander to kind of help drop out some of those voices in between you know the person who's actually talking live on the mic you know get rid of everybody else and any extra background noise or you know the other people speaking that that you might get so that's kind of my recommendation there and I'm gonna say that in less words replying to Victor's comment here ah loves me some coffee gotta have some coffee right alright reply heart and a thumbs up thanks man alright next best background audio noise reduction plugin I found the pro version useless for dialogue to be honest just good for music alright so this is a about a background background noise removal plugin clarity VX from waves the thing's fantastic but it needs to be used in the right situation right it depends on what the background noise is as far as how well of a job it kind of gets rid of that background noise so the pro version is just a more advanced version of the basic version it just depends if you'd want more options I'd always recommend download trials for things before you go ahead and purchase something just because I say it's good doesn't mean it's gonna work good for you so you should always do trials first most places offer trials with pretty much anything you could give it a shot so let's see so I found the pro version useless just good for music so I'm gonna tell this guy like you know it depends on the situation that you're using it and then we're gonna go ahead and give you a heart because I appreciate your comment alright next we've got same video there the background audio noise reduction for anyone saying that isotope RX is better for noise reduction compared to this sniffs glue for a living I don't know about that I've actually never used isotope RX although I did talk with Jay Lippman a lot at resolve con about isotope RX and you know some of the tools and things that they got in there and I do want to give it a try one of these days I have not tried it out yet so I can't really speak to that so I'm just gonna be honest say I've never tried isotope RX but I do hear that it's awesome and we're gonna give you a heart because I appreciate you alright on the blue yeti once again I use a PC what's the easiest way of getting a lower base level when recording with the blue yeti is this possible straight out of the box if not what's the best way to boost base levels so the blue yeti if you guys aren't familiar with it it's actually on my shelf over there but it's a USB microphone and it does have a gain knob on it now some microphones have a gain knob some don't for example this one right here it's an XLR mic does not so I have to adjust my levels either between my computer and my audio interface so on the audio interface I can adjust it with the blue yeti itself it has a gain knob on it but you want to be careful because if you bring that up too much it just starts to pick up all kinds of like crazy noise all over the place I mean any little noise in your room house wherever you're recording is gonna get picked up and it's it just picks up everything so my recommendation is keep that gain up as low as it can go so that way you're not picking up all this extra stuff that you don't want to be picking up but the other way that you can do it if you can't get you know a good base level using just the gain knob on there is you want to jump in your computer settings your sound preferences and you want to set your levels for the microphone the input levels there on your computer and I'm on a Mac now so I'm gonna show you here but on a PC you jump into those sound settings find the microphone as the input and then you can adjust your levels there should be a slider in there and you can adjust that and that's how you're gonna be able to set the level so that's what I'm gonna tell Brian here on how to set the base levels for your blue yeti and as I was typing this up here one other way that you can adjust the levels is in your recording software right so if you're recording into the venture resolve for example you've got path settings where you can adjust the input level of your microphone say you adjusted it you know on your computer and on the mic itself or whatever your audio interface whatever it might be you adjusted it as much as you can you can jump into your recording program doesn't have to be resolved but that's what I use a lot and you can adjust the levels in there so keep that in mind that's a third way that you can adjust the levels for the blue yeti here so I'm gonna go ahead here reply and give you a heart and a thumbs up next is a comment on a video about power bins here in resolve does Premiere Pro have an equivalent system to power bins I don't know I've actually never used Premiere Pro I wanted to get into it but then I stumbled on Casey Ferris's videos and DaVinci resolve here a bunch of years ago and I was like well I'm not gonna pay more than for just the photography plan from Adobe if I can try out resolve for free and it worked out great and the rest is history so I've never actually tried Premiere Pro so I'm gonna be honest and just say I don't know never tried Premiere Pro and a little heart and a thumbs up alright next about media offline I love your videos so much you are knowledgeable and put so much effort into making these videos the best quality they can be appreciate that man thank you I'm so glad I found your channel you're an amazing teacher well I really appreciate when people just leave you know a comment you know just saying that they appreciate the videos that I make cuz you know a lot of times sit here by myself and you know what it doesn't always feel like you're doing anything good in the world here right but it's nice when people say how much you're you're helping them out and everything so I'm just gonna say thanks man I appreciate you and I appreciate you watching next up here we have a super thanks check this out on a best export settings from DaVinci resolve five bucks thanks really appreciate Flora Lux thank you so much for for that five bucks and for support my channel here I appreciate you thank you for watching I'm gonna say thank you so much and then looks like she has another question too that we're gonna answer here in a second and we're definitely gonna give you a heart and a thumbs up on that five bucks and then she asks you are a god send oh man thanks so much between this video and you're rendering with nodes for iPhone it seems the issue is officially resolved thank you so much alright I'm just gonna say you're welcome glad I could help alright next up fixing sound in resolve when there's problems you can't get any sound thank you you made my life easier you're welcome I am backed up I usually don't have you know too many comments but I haven't answered comments since then the last week so I try to do it every day because a little bit at a time isn't so bad but sometimes they kind of pile up and hey this is the first episode here so we're giving you tons of questions that we're answering and I hope you guys are finding this helpful if you are comment below hit the like button thumbs up there for me and let me know what you think about this little series is something that you might be interested in I don't know we're gonna try it out for a little while see what happens alright next is on DaVinci resolve transitions for beginners I've been using transitions in resolve for months it's been great however in my latest video when I drag and when I or when I drop a transition I get a few frames during the transition where the colors go weird like pink when the transition ends the colors return to normal I'm using 30 frames per second one second transitions has never happened before I'm in multi cam mode putting several angles together make one video this happened to every single transition I put on this project I thought it was just an edit mode and in edit mode and the pink transitions I'm just gonna assume would not render out but the pink frames are there in the finished video I ended up just removing all the transitions because it looks so bad any idea why and how I can correct this I make several videos and this never happened I'm shooting on a Ken R5 a 5d mark to and an iPhone Tom alright Tom I'm not really sure what might be going on there the only thing I can think is if you're in a multi cam clip and maybe there's something in there is there anything in there that's pink I don't know I mean if one of the tracks was pink maybe for some reason it's pulling that through worst case what I would do is I would just copy everything into a new timeline try that see if that helped it and if that doesn't work I would then take everything and I would bring it into like a new project you know just paste everything into a new timeline in a new project see if that works and then otherwise I'm not really sure why you might be getting a pink I don't know which transition you're trying to use maybe there's something in that transition that is just reacting with some of the colors in your video not really sure so I'm gonna say something like that and my response here probably in fewer words but that's what I'm thinking so far and the things that I would try to see if it helps fix the problem so a lot of times when people are having problems I you know like with the transitions here in resolve it just takes kind of playing around with it and from sitting on my end it's hard if I can't just get in there and fiddle around and and try things out it's hard to figure out what might be going on with it so I usually try to just give a few suggestions and then just kind of leave it at that and say I would just try these couple things and maybe it'll work maybe it won't I don't know so we're gonna go ahead and reply I'm gonna give you a heart and a thumbs up all right no audio in resolve from part two thanks so much has really helped me out you're welcome best export settings from resolve 17 glad I came across this video about the presets I'm working on a video here where I need to be high quality or else but also a smaller file size unfortunately balloon five times its size thanks again just a word of advice don't use the YouTube export settings from resolve they're terrible it ain't gonna look good if you want to know some good custom settings that I use definitely check out this video right here to venture resolve 17 export render settings for YouTube that's gonna give you some better settings and also if you're only exporting in 1080 even if you're editing in 1080 you want to export it in 4k because when you upload it to YouTube YouTube will give you the better VP 9 codec if you upload 1080 video the codec's not gonna be as good your video ain't gonna look as good you're gonna be like why is my stuff not look good on YouTube well that's why because you uploaded a 1080 so I think you need to do at least a 1440 size video or whatever but I always I did all my editing in 1080 I don't film in 4k and 1080 and then I will export from resolve in 4k and then upload that to YouTube and you get the better VP 9 codec and then your videos are just gonna look better alright had a color grade iPhone footage in DaVinci Resolve 18 alright Lewis says amazing how many people know nothing of color management if you use wide gamut DaVinci does the color space transform automatically selecting the right input for or input color space alright cool man that's good to know hopefully that helps somebody out I'm gonna say thanks for sharing your advice and we're gonna go ahead and give you a heart alright next on the Samsung QX9 video Ryan says that might sounds great it sounded a bit thin for my taste when you turned on the vocal processing and I would agree with that I like it without the vocal processing we get more of that low end and in post we can always take out the low end if we want right but if you record it without the low end you can't add it back in right not usually so whatever I leave that turned off and and I think it sounds great too and give you heart and thumbs up next how to save text in DaVinci Resolve 16 a lot of this stuff is the same for 16 17 18 like a lot of these DaVinci Resolve things like it doesn't matter what version it's the same in all of them so let's see off Laura she's the one who gave us the super thanks a little bit ago concise and exactly what I needed another guy made a 17 minute video and I just couldn't ha ha ha ha ha thanks again all right I'm gonna say thanks so much for watching all right moving on down here we have DaVinci Resolve 18 transition for beginners video hi Jason wow here's the first tutorial that explains that you have to have an overlap between the two clips and how to get the overlap but needless to say the first time I tried the clip to the right won't move I sometimes feel like throwing DaVinci Resolve out the window nothing works nothing ever works the first time or as you think it should 100% true that's why one of the things that makes DaVinci Resolve learning curves so steep is that you know there's a lot of things that are just not very intuitive for whatever reason I don't know I don't know why and granted I haven't used many other editor programs but there's a lot of things in DaVinci Resolve that are just not intuitive or that like they don't work the way you think they might so that makes resolve take a long time to learn so I'm gonna head and reply this guy and say thanks for watching glad you're getting it figured out there go ahead give you a like and a thumbs up and same person another comment on the same video hi Jason as beginner I find DaVinci Resolve very problematic your video shows it's easy to add a transition but when I try and then playback nothing happens between the two clips no transitions so if you see the transition on the between your clips there it's probably just a playback issue and that could be because your computer doesn't have you know doesn't have good good good specs or whatever there's some things you can do to try and change that but it sounds like it's just a playback issue versus the clip not actually going on there if you don't see the transition on there then you're gonna have to shorten each one of your clips a little bit so hopefully based on your last comment that I just answered you're able to figure that out so that's kind of what I'm thinking about that alright another comment on the QX9 review that looks very much like the Rode Pod mic cardioid dynamic broadcast microphone which as of today is selling for $90 on Amazon I'd love to see a comparison if you have time in the future thanks for the Samsung QX9 review nicely done as always looks promising so I've never used the Rode mic I don't have one if Rode if you want to send me one that would be pretty sweet because then I would happily compare it to this see how they how they work out 90 bucks is a little bit cheaper this one's 130 but even at 130 this one is a great deal I think it sounds great I'm sure the Rode one does pretty well too I know it's a fairly popular microphone I've just never tried it out but thanks there mr. digital for for dropping a comment little heart and thumbs up alright next we have how to make music songs longer in the venture resolve 17 I don't know how you did it's not working for me well I'm not sure what you're doing did you watch the video I think I showed how to do it in there I'm not really sure why it might not be working for you because I don't know what you're doing you didn't really give me enough information here so I'll just say what parts not working how can I help I'm always happy to help people out more if I can alright so it looks like we got everybody I'm just gonna filter these out here by response status ones I have not responded to see make sure we got everybody here let's see a little comment here on no audio into ventures off hi Jason not sure if you know this when I'm having problems with OBS audio brought into the ventures off the first half of my clips still show no waveforms sometimes the audio is still there sometimes it's not sometimes it comes in through just one speaker for a few seconds and then the other speaker comes in if you had any issues or fixes with this if I play the clip through another app it works fine sometimes you get weird audio issues like that in resolve and sometimes it's a codec issue with the audio so if you can convert the audio using something like I don't I think handbrake does it or there's other free audio programs out there I think that you can just like convert it to you know another mp3 or whatever I don't know this codec that resolve has a problem with and maybe that's why I don't know what OBS is using there I mean I've used OBS before not a ton I don't think I've really had any issues with it but I'm gonna try to start using a little bit more because I want to try do some live streams maybe I should do this is a live stream they don't gotta edit it huh hmm I don't know we'll see but yeah that's what I would try I would try convert no audio first I'm not sure why otherwise it might be having a problem there so that's what I'm gonna say alright just a few more here I'm gonna wrap this up soon on a channel discussion I actually posted a comment said what do you guys want to learn in resolve so I want to make videos that are helpful for you guys and helpful for people that are just getting started so what do you want to know and this person here said removing black backgrounds and composition so I'm gonna go ahead and give them a heart a lot of times for polls or you know if I if I post a question you know about asking you guys what you want to see I don't necessarily respond to that I'm just gonna make note of it and keep it in mind for future videos next easy audio compression the MV2 from waves is is really good if you're looking for a good easy to use compressor check that out but high-tech productions here says I have the L2 ultra maximizer from waves any thoughts on how it compares I haven't used the ultra maximizer yet I will give it a try because I do have all of the waves plug-in so I'll give it a try I don't know how it is yet but I'm gonna give it a try and see how it works out so I'm just gonna be honest and tell you I don't know how it works out but I'm gonna give it a try all right split screen for multiple clips in DaVinci resolve here's a question this is absolutely not precise if you have four clips how do you align them in each of the corners I don't want nearly aligned I want I need pixel perfect alignment with the screen divided in four equal areas this is is there a way to do this without spending a ridiculous amount of time so in this one I did just kind of move them around and eyeball it in there and you can still do that in resolve actually let's jump over into resolve right now so if I'm in here let's just grab this other timeline here just copy this over I'm just gonna make a couple copies here so now it's that we've got four different points of the clip here we want them in four equal corners let's see how do we do so just scale some of these guys down here a little bit right so I can see what's going on all right so we want them all in in the corner so one thing I think we might be able to do is come to our effects library open effects and we have worry at video collage so that's gonna give you equal spacing or can space it equally or whatever let me see if I just dump it on all these guys been a little while since I use this effect so let's say video collage onto a layer let's say I want this to be create a tile all right so I think this would work I'm not gonna fiddle with it now because it's just gonna take time that I don't have so I think you can use the collage effect or you could just do the math right because you know if you went down in this case I got a 1080 timeline here so I know it's 1920 right on the bottom side so I can just do the math and figure out what position X and Y where I should push it and remember for your video that X is the point is right in the middle of the video so looking on my screen here right there that point right there is where the anchor point is right so when I want to move it over so that you know it's on this side of the screen I'm moving over by 480 so how did I get there while I took 1920 right which is the size of the whole screen I divided it by 2 right because I'm gonna have one video on each side which gave me 960 but if I put in 960 right here 960 it moves that middle anchor point all the way to the edge of the screen right so we don't want to do that so I actually wanted to go halfway over right because that I know that anchor points right in the middle of the video that's just how it is by default so I'm gonna divide 960 by 2 and I get 480 so then boom 480 boom and there you go so this one would be 480 this one would you know over here would be minus 480 and then up here you just do the math to move it up you know and move it down because you're 1080 tall right so just a little bit of math trying to figure out you know the numbers and where to put stuff so hopefully that's that's helpful maybe should make a video on that should jot that down how to get windows exactly where you want them to be in DaVinci Resolve so that's kind of in a nutshell I'm how I'm gonna do I'm gonna suggest using the the the collage effect and then just doing the math and figuring out where you want to position your clips alright so we reply to him and we're gonna give him a little heart and a thumbs up and I think that's where we're gonna call it some quits today on all these comments again it's been a few days so I'm I was a little backed up which is why this video is so long hopefully in the future they're gonna be a little bit shorter we're just gonna nail some some some questions I mean I could probably do this every day I should do a live stream like every day would you guys want to see this live streamed or you like just a little video like this where I just kind of go through up and you know highlight the questions and all that kind of stuff I don't know you guys let me know do you think this is a good idea is it gonna be helpful to you guys answering some questions about different things that people have comments on and I'm going through and doing this anyway so if I can make a video on it and then just more people get to see the answers to these questions I think it could be helpful for you guys so you know it could be like a morning thing you know we grab our cup of joe we sit here we hang out we answer comments from you guys because that's why I'm here on YouTube to help you guys out and you know it's just it's it's an honor and a blessing to be able to help you guys out there and just you know really do what I do here on YouTube super thankful for the opportunity to be able to do this so I would love to hear your guys thoughts on this video what you think should we keep doing it if you've got other questions leave it on a video somewhere comment on this video I don't know I'm gonna try making a couple of these we'll see how it goes if you guys are interested and you know we'll take it from there hey this whole YouTube thing sometimes it's a little trial and error right but if there's more examples that are a little more in-depth to I can jump into DaVinci Resolve to and show you how to do different things or whatever the question might be there surprisingly was not many things where I had to jump in resolve today to answer questions but I will jump in there if I need to I think that could be kind of cool and could be helpful for you guys so with that said guys I'm gonna wrap up this first episode here of answering your questions and comments and yeah you guys have a great day and I look forward to seeing you guys in the next video peace
