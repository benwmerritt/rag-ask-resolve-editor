Do you ever run into problems you don't know how to fix when you're working on your project in DaVinci Resolve? I sure have, but today I've got six fixes for you on how to fix problems that are pretty common that you might run across while you're working in DaVinci Resolve. Today's video is sponsored by Skillshare, but let's get into these six fixes for your problems in DaVinci Resolve. So let's say you're trying to render out your project in DaVinci Resolve and it keeps crashing on you and you don't know why. Now there could be a whole bunch of different reasons, but if we check these two options in our preferences, that'll at least prevent some of the things that may not matter so much from stopping your render from completing. Check this out. In DaVinci Resolve, we're going to go to the DaVinci Resolve menu and bring up our preferences. Now in our preferences, we want to go to user at the top and then in our UI settings, down here we have these two options. Stop playback when a dropped frame is detected and stop renders when a frame or clip cannot be processed. Now by default, when I started in Resolve, these were checked on. I'm not sure if they are. If you've never touched these settings, they may be on, they may not be. I'm not sure, but check it and make sure that they're turned off. You do not want the check marks here because that's going to tell Resolve, hey, if there's a little problem with either a dropped frame or a frame can't be processed, stop the whole render. I found that once I turn this on, it would render out videos with no problems and any of those dropped frames never really made a difference in anything that I ever noticed when I was rendering out my videos. So I leave these turned off and if you're having problems rendering out your video, it keeps crashing and you don't know why, turn these two options off and hopefully then it'll go ahead and render your video all the way out. The next fix that we have here is when your playback gets a little slow. Now maybe you started your project, everything was working out fine and smooth and then maybe you added in some higher resolution footage or maybe your project just started slowing down and you didn't know why. Here's a few things you can check to help restore the workflow of your project and make it run a little bit smoother. So if you've got a lot of footage in your project, you may want to come up to the playback menu, timeline proxy resolution and change it from full down to either half or quarter. That's going to just make playback a little bit easier on your machine and make Resolve be able to play back your footage easier too. Then you can also check your render cache. Now this may be set to none, I like to leave it on smart and that allows Resolve to kind of render things in the background while you're not doing anything and that just kind of helps with the overall smoothness of your playback. Now where you might run into some issues is when your render cache is set to something like smart or user and you've got a lot of render cache. You've got so much that it's actually bogging down your machine because those render cache files can get really huge really quick. So I recommend every once in a while you go in and delete all those render cache files and it's not going to mess up your project and if DaVinci Resolve needs those cache files again, it'll just recreate them. So here's how you can delete those files. Again in your playback menu if you come down to delete render cache, you can do all right here or you can come to here manage cache data and what that's going to do is bring up a list of all of your projects and which ones have cache associated with them and which ones don't. For example, here's one that has 996 megs of cache, I could delete that, you can select all of these, you can select one of these, you can pick the projects that you want to delete the cache from and that's a great way to do it right here because you can see what you're deleting. Now real quick, the way I like to do it is just to go into my folder in Finder or Explorer and just delete all of the cache files. So for me, I go to my directory where I store all my cache files which is on an external hard drive. I've got my cache clip folder here and in here I've got all these different cache files that I don't know what they are but I'm just going to go ahead and delete them all because it's going to clean everything up and if Resolve needs them, it'll recreate them and for me, it doesn't really affect my workflow all that much for Resolve to have to recreate any of the cache files that it might need. So I'll just come in the cache clip folder, select them all, right click, move to trash, that's it, my cache files are cleaned up, you might get a lot of space back on your computer or your hard drive too. But those cache files could be bogging down DaVinci Resolve on you. And on a side note, I would put those cache files on an SSD external drive so you don't clog up your internal drive on your computer there because they add up quick if you're doing a lot of projects in DaVinci Resolve. This next one is one I get all the time and that's I don't have any audio in DaVinci Resolve. Now there's a lot of reasons why you might not have audio but here is the biggest one and the most popular fix for not having audio in DaVinci Resolve. So in Resolve, you want to come up to the DaVinci Resolve, the top left, come down to preferences. In preferences, we want to go to system, you want to go to video and audio I slash O, go to the audio in and out and down here we have output device. You want to make sure that that output device is set to your output device. Sometimes Resolve will grab a different output device from your computer and it's not your speakers or your headphones. So you want to double check that, that's one of the most common problems is that Resolve just isn't pointing to the correct output for your audio. Now if for some reason you select your output device here but you still don't hear it, just close Resolve and open it back up but make sure your output device is connected to your computer whether it's headphones, your speakers, whatever it might be. For whatever reason, sometimes Resolve just doesn't pick up your default speaker setup or headphones or whatever it might be and that's why you're not getting any audio at a DaVinci Resolve. I've got another four fixes for you here coming up but before we get there, I want to tell you a little bit about some of the classes I've been taking on Skillshare. You might know our friend Marcel, the modern filmmaker, he's got a DaVinci Resolve class on there that's really good. I've been going through it and watching it. He does a great job of explaining a lot of the basics and things you need to know about DaVinci Resolve when you're getting started. So if you're looking to learn more about DaVinci Resolve, I'd recommend go over to Skillshare and check out Marcel's class. Some of the other classes I've been checking out lately are ones that have to do with audio mixing, how to mix drums. I also like looking at how to grow your YouTube channel, how to make better videos but there is a ton of different kinds of topics and subjects that you can learn there. Maybe you want to get out of that boring 9-5 job and you want to get into something else but you need to take some classes to learn a little bit more about it before you make that jump to leave your full-time 9-5 and go with something that you enjoy a little bit more. So there's got those kinds of classes that you can jump on there, learn everything that you need to know to be able to make changes in your job or start side hustles. All of the classes that I've watched on there have been super helpful and gave me a lot of great information. And if you're one of the first 500 people to sign up using my link in the description below, you'll get a month for free. You can jump on there, check out any class that you want while you have that free month's trial. A big thank you to Skillshare for sponsoring today's video. Now let's get back into the rest of our fixes for problems you might have here in DaVinci Resolve. So a lot of people like to record directly into DaVinci Resolve and I myself do that pretty often. But a lot of people run into issues where Resolve won't record and they don't know why it won't work. Now there's four steps in that process and I'm going to talk about them real quick here and then I'm also going to show you what happens when you can't find where your voiceover was recorded. You're like, where did it go? I can't find the file. I don't know where it is. I'm going to show you where it is. So the four steps you need to do in order to record into DaVinci Resolve are this. Step number one, make sure your microphone is set as your input device. You're going to go to DaVinci Resolve, down to preferences. Again you're going to go to System Audio Video I slash O and under the input section for audio you're going to make sure you have your microphone selected. Now sometimes by default Resolve doesn't select your microphone so this is step number one, make sure your microphone is set as the input. Step two in the process is to come to Fairlight at the top, come down to Patch Input Output. That's going to bring up your patching and what you want to do is on the left side select audio inputs, you're going to select your microphone. In my case I know it's channel one on my audio interface. Select your destination which is going to be your track input and now you can select your track and then hit patch and that's going to patch your microphone into your track. Step number three to record into DaVinci Resolve is to arm your track to record. Whenever you have a track in DaVinci Resolve and you have a microphone patched into it, this little R right here is going to be selectable. You can click on it and you can see mine doesn't light up because my microphone is not patched at the moment because I'm using it. But if your microphone is properly patched in to this channel I can hit the R, it's going to light up red and then I can record into DaVinci Resolve. That doesn't start recording yet because that's only the third step in the process. We need to do step number four in order to actually start the recording in DaVinci Resolve. So step number four in Fairlight here is to hit the record button which is in our toolbar just above the timeline. So you need to hit that record button then DaVinci Resolve will start recording. Typically if your recording is not working you're missing one of those steps or you need to double check them. So those are the four steps you need in order to record voiceovers or a microphone directly into DaVinci Resolve. So you recorded into DaVinci Resolve and now you're like I can't find my file where did it go? I have no idea where it went. So here's the fix to find out where did DaVinci Resolve put your voiceover file. Now this is going to vary on a project by project basis depending if you told to resolve where to put this file. We want to come down to the gear icon at the bottom right, our project settings. Go ahead and open that up. Then we want to come to capture and playback and under the capture section we have right here save clips to. By default this is the location where all of your cache files are. So if you can't find your recording it's probably wherever your cache files are and whatever appears in this box right here. You can look and copy that and go find it in your either finder or your Windows Explorer. Now what I like to do is I like to save my recordings with the project. So I'm going to come to browse here and then I would just go browse to the directory for my project and it will automatically save those recordings into my project directory. And this is going to be on a project by project basis. The default for this field here where the clips get saved is the cache file location. So you need to change it on a project by project basis. And as a bonus fix here if you don't know what your file is even named you have no idea here's a quick tip for you. Your recorded file in DaVinci Resolve when recording right into Resolve will have the same name as your track. So in this case if I recorded on this track right here it's going to be titled Jays Recording and it may have some numbers or date or something after it but it's going to say Jays Recording so I know where to find it or how to search for it in case I don't know where it is and I can't find it based on checking out the previous fix in our project settings. The next fix I have for you is when you try and slow down a clip in your timeline and it just doesn't look smooth it looks jittery it doesn't look good. There's some settings we can change to make that playback a little bit better right here in Resolve check it out. So here my timeline I've got a video of a guy doing a flip on a dirt bike and I want it to be in slow motion. So the first thing I'm going to do is make my clip slow motion. So I'm going to select my clip commander control R open my read time controls I'm going to select 50% change the speed 50%. Now if I play through the clip now you're going to notice it looks a little bit jittery right because there's not enough frames there to make that smooth. Well we can use some settings here in our inspector so make sure your inspector is open come down to your read time and scaling settings for read time process we want to change this to optical flow then for motion estimation you want to change those as well. Now if your machine doesn't have a ton of power maybe you don't have a great graphics card you maybe want to use something like enhance faster or enhance better but if you want the best results and have it look the best that resolve can do you're going to want to go ahead and pick speed warp but do know that speed warp is going to slow down your machine a little bit until it renders up if you have your rendered cache turned on which you should so it's going to bog down the machine a little bit because speed warp is a pretty intense process for your machine to handle but I'm going to choose speed warp here so you can see what the results look like. So the clip has been cached we got the blue line and here's what it looks like if we play through it. Pretty amazing that resolve can create those frames and blend it together like they were always there to begin with. So if your slow mo clips don't look good try those two settings and it should help them look a lot better. And the last fix that I have for you that's a common problem that I hear is when you create a vertical video for something like YouTube shorts or tiktok or Instagram and it's a vertical format you create it in DaVinci resolve maybe your timeline is a vertical format and then you go to export it you upload it and on YouTube for example it doesn't see it as a short. Why doesn't it see it as a short I don't understand what's going on I made a vertical video it should be a short. Here's two things you can check to make sure your vertical video is actually vertical so you can get it onto the platform of your choice. So in the deliver tab here in DaVinci resolve let's say you set your project to be rendered maybe you pick the YouTube preset or one of these other presets for me I have my own presets I have a 1080 to 4k preset here and I have everything set up and I'm ready to go render out my video it's a vertical video but in order to render that vertical video you need to check this right here use vertical resolution if you don't have that vertical resolution button checked you're going to get a horizontal aspect ratio with your vertical video in the middle of it then you go to upload it somewhere like YouTube and you get a regular sized video and it doesn't allow you to use it as a short so that's a common thing people forget to check that box when you're rendering out the vertical video so make sure that that box is checked. So the problem that I've seen with YouTube shorts is if it needs to be less than a minute but you're really close to it say you're at 59 point something seconds and it's not quite a minute in resolve when you look at it but when you render it out it actually renders as like a minute or just over a minute maybe so when you go to upload it to YouTube you've got your vertical video it's rendered out vertical properly like we just talked about but when you put it on YouTube it still doesn't put it up as a short it may be because it's just too close to that one minute mark and it doesn't allow you to put it up as a short I've run into that problem so that might be something that you might come across as well. There you have it six fixes for common problems here in DaVinci Resolve if you found one of these helpful that you didn't know drop me a comment let me know or if you have another fix for a common problem that you usually have let us know help out the community leave that in the comment as well.
