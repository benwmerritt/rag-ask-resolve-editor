## Transcript
ifyouoptientspeedtoe What's happening guys? We are testing out the V-MIC 5 Pro. I should be here listening to this conference here, but I gotta be honest, I'm a little more excited about testing out some of this stuff here from Saramonic and working on some videos for you guys. I gotta get going with this. We gotta try this guy out. This is a super cardioid microphone that goes right on top of your camera. I think what we're gonna do is, uh, you're just gonna come around with me for a little while. We're gonna talk about some goals here, some goals I had in 2021, and then some goals that I have coming up here in 2022, kind of where one of this channel goes, stuff like that. All in the idea of testing out this microphone and maybe giving you guys some ideas of what's going on with me, what I'm thinking, where we've been, where we're going, all that kind of fun stuff and hopefully you find this helpful. And at the end, we're gonna wrap it up and see how this microphone does. Super curious to see how this microphone does here. The Saramonic V-MIC 5 Pro. So let's get going here. Yo, what's going on guys? Jumping in real quick. Forgot to tell you, you are gonna have a chance to win this microphone. There's a contest link in the description below. Check that out. Thank you Saramonic for giving us two of these guys, one for me to test out and one for you guys to win. So hit that link up. You're gonna want to try and win this microphone because I'm here to tell you this thing is great. Watch the rest of the video. You can see how it sounds. I'll do some tests. Things are time stamped. Check it out. Let me know what you think. I want to hear your thoughts and good luck if you get in that contest. Alright, so first step is we actually got to go grab my goals from 2021. So I remember what they are. We could check them off and hopefully we can check most of them off the list. We're gonna see here. Alright, it is a dreary rainy day here in February 2022. 222 actually. So I've got the goals here. Let's chat a little bit. So the first couple things that are actually on my list here. I'm a religious guy. So what I got on here is a few Bible verses that I like to keep in mind. So the first one I got here is whatever you do, work out with all your heart is working for the Lord, not for human masters. Another one I have is commit to the Lord, whatever you do, he will establish your plan. So for me, just put all my effort into it and do the best I can for you guys and try and serve other people. That's always one of my top priorities on my channel here. Okay, moving on to some other goals here. So one of the ones I got on here is get 50 to 75,000 subscribers in 2021. Now we were close. We didn't quite get to 50. We were about 48 and change something like that. So we were close. Didn't quite get there, but we were close. So you know what? We're over 50 now and I'm just gonna go ahead and say that that one got checked off. So we met that goal. Here are those birds out there man. I don't know where those guys are at, but they loud. They loud. Alright, next one we got on the list here. Looks like we have make videos that have come up in searches and look at my videos that are already doing well and expand on those ideas. I have done that a little bit. I kind of looked at videos that do well and try and make other similar videos because obviously if they're doing well, that's the kind of stuff you guys want to see and you want to know about or learn about. So I try to make more videos that you guys want to watch. No brainer, right? When you're trying to run a YouTube channel, you want to make videos that people want to watch. One of the best ways to do that is see what's already worked on your channel and start making more content that's related to that. I would have to give myself a check mark on that too. The next one is tricky. We got better titles, better thumbnails and taking a look at the analytics a little more. So better thumbnails. I don't know man. I struggle with thumbnails. I feel like mine are stinky. I feel like they ain't that great and I have a hard time putting my finger on what makes a good thumbnail. But I definitely think it's improved since from where we've been. So I give myself a half check mark on that. Making better titles. I kind of try to just have the title say what the video is because if you guys are looking at it, you want to know what it is. It's a tutorial channel. I don't want to click bait and all that. So I just try to name it what it is. Now I just got a little drop off from my UPS guy. Love that guy. He's always bringing me some good stuff. You know what I mean? Alright so the next goal ahead on here was reviewing the analytics. Now I haven't been great at this. I have been looking at them a little more. But what I really need to do is dig in there and figure out what is going on with particular videos and how can I use those analytics to help me grow and continue to make this channel better for you guys and just grow more. I've been looking at it a little bit but I feel like that's another area that I really need to improve in is analytics. Alright so another thing that I had on my list here is come up with ways to make more income through this channel. It takes a lot of time to run a YouTube channel and make these videos to do all this stuff for you guys. I need to have a way to support myself, support my family and coming up with different ways to monetize is going to help me do that. Now you get YouTube ad revenue. That's great. Affiliate links. I've created new products and I have more of the launch coming up here in the next few months. Working with different companies, brand deals and that kind of stuff. Those things are starting to take off. I have all the pieces in place which is great. That's been making a few bucks every month. My own products that I made have been making money so that's great. The big thing that started to take off lately is working with brands and getting paid to do brand deals and sponsored videos. For me I'm always going to do something that I would use or that might benefit you guys and you guys might find helpful. That's a big way that's going to help generate more income and just help me to continue to do this full time because let's be honest this is way better than a real job. Just some other little pointers I had on here for myself. Start a video with a question. Sometimes I do that. I try to make the intros short. I've actually gotten rid of my intros. I don't really even use them much anymore. Be consistent with posting. I have to say I've been pretty consistent. I think the last two years, each year I had it put out was it 94 videos, 95 videos, something like that. Engage with you guys. Let's on here. I want to get engaged with you guys more. I do that by just responding to all your comments. I try to respond to everybody's comment and just help everybody as much as I can. I think that helps differentiate me a little bit from other YouTubers. The last one I put on here is keep learning. I've got to keep learning. You've got to learn about YouTube, photography, videography, all this stuff. Keep up with technology, all those things. You've got to keep learning because if you stop learning, that's when in my opinion you start to fall behind. Those are my goals in 2021. I think I accomplished most of them. You could always do better. In 2022 here, let's go find out what those goals are and where I want to go and things I want to do in 2022. Off to the bus stop. Here we go. There we go. I've got to put the seatbelt on. Always get the seatbelt on. Alright, let's go. Hitting back, hitting back. Checking the mirrors. Oh, my bad. Just realized, what was that? Shut the speed of 50. I should have been at a shutter speed of 60. 80 things happen sometimes. When we get to the bus stop here, I got to tell you a little bit about this microphone from Ceremonic because man, this thing is awesome. I got some good stuff to tell you about it. You know what I hate? I hate when you record a whole thing and then realize you didn't actually push the record button all the way. You know what? Let me check this right now. Alright, yeah. It would be super helpful if they put a little record button on the front of the camera because man, just filmed the whole thing and I didn't actually record anything. I just talked to myself in the car here like an idiot. But that's alright. This microphone is awesome. So one of the cool features it has is it's got a high-pass filter built in. So what does that mean? It means that you can cut out low frequencies. So on this microphone, you can set it to either 75 Hertz or is it 70 Hertz? I think 75 Hertz. Or you can set it to 150 Hertz. Now the 75 Hertz is going to cut out anything below that and everything above that is going to pass through. So what does a high-pass filter do? Well, sometimes with these microphones or any microphone in general, you get a little bit of rumbling, right? And now when we're listening to music, you want that low-end bass. But when we're talking and I'm doing vlog stuff, you might not want that bass. So that high-pass filter is going to cut out some of that boominess or muddiness at the bottom. Now for me, I don't think I'd use the one that is a 150 Hertz high-pass filter because sometimes you want those a little bit of a lower frequencies in there. You don't want it to sound hollow. And for me, in post when I apply a high-pass filter, generally I'm going to set that around 100 to 120 at most. So for me, I would use the 75 Hertz and that's what I'm using right now for this whole video so far. I'm going to see how that works out and then I'll try some without it. I'll even try the 150 too. See how that sounds. Alright, we're still recording. I just checked it because I don't want to have that happen again. I forget to record. So another cool thing about this mic and probably the most awesome thing about it is that it turns off when you turn the camera off. It turns on automatically when you turn on the camera and it turns off automatically when you turn off the camera. I just realized that a few minutes ago when I turned it off and then turned it back on again after I got up here. I was like, what? This thing turns off on and off by itself? That is sweet because how many times, right? Have you left on the microphone because you forgot to turn off the batteries? You forgot to turn it off and you killed your batteries, right? So you got dead batteries and you're like, ah man, kill my batteries. Change batteries and all that. So it's real nice, like super nice, like nice job, Ceremonic, that this thing turns on and off with your camera. Pretty sweet. And speaking of batteries, this thing doesn't have any external batteries. It doesn't take AA's or AAA's, anything like that. It's got an internal battery. You charge it through USB-C. So that's pretty good. I don't know how long it lasts. We'll see. It wasn't fully charged when I got it. I don't know how much charge it had because there's no little indicator on it. So I don't know how much charge it has, but it'd be interesting to see what happens and how long it lasts. So USB-C charge, you charge it up. It turns on and off with the camera. That is huge. I think that's a really, really great feature here on this microphone. Again, nice job, Ceremonic. That is awesome. Awesome, I tell you. And another feature on here is the ability to adjust your input levels. Now, you do want to adjust it on your camera, but most of the time you don't want to turn it up too high on your camera because you could get some static in there, the preamps on these cameras. They're just, they're not good, right? They're not great. So you always want to keep those levels on your camera as low as you can. But if you need a little more out of it, you don't want to boost it on your camera, you do have the option to go plus 20 dB on the microphone itself. And it also has a minus 10 dB. So if it's too loud, you don't want, you can't boost your levels down anymore or drop your levels, I should say, not boost. Drop your levels down anymore. Then you can go ahead and use that minus 10 dB. For me right now, I just have it set at zero, so nothing added, nothing taken away. Just is what it is. And I set my levels good on my camera where I wanted it to be. So all in all, so far, I'm pretty impressed with this microphone. It'd be interesting to see what happens once we get it back into the computer and see how it sounds. So let's say with the microphone here, comment below with how you think it sounds. Really curious to see what your thoughts are. So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to grab the children here and then we're going to get into talking about some of my goals here for 2022. All right, here we go. 2022 goals. Let's see what we got. So the first one I got on here is we want to get to 100,000 subs. Might seems like a lot, kind of seems far to me too, but what I see on YouTube a lot is everything grows exponentially, right? So it starts like this, goes like this, and it's like, I'm just going to keep cranking out the good content, make the best videos I can. And hopefully we're going to get up to 100K this year. And that would be awesome. Next thing I got on this list is more collaborations, right? Want to work with some other people out there. There's tons of great creators. So if you want to see me work with somebody, comment down below. Maybe I'll just shoot them an email and say, Hey, would you guys want to make a video together? Of course, I do want to mention that up front. Now, you know, those Bible verse ahead also apply to 2022. It's always at the top of my list. Keep those on top of my mind because for me, that's important. One thing I do want to get better at is storytelling. I feel like I stink at telling stories, not only here on YouTube, but in real life too. I'm not a good storyteller. Storytelling. That's a big one for me this year. Here's one for you. I was going to take the Blackmagic Design test, try and pass all those guys. Although I took one and I didn't pass it. I was like, what? Some obscure stuff in there. And it was even the basic one. I didn't pass it, but I'm a terrible test taker. So I might rethink that goal, although I would like to pass all of them. But, yeah, dude, I stink at taking tests. I stink at taking tests. Another big one is more brand collaborations. And I've already started that. And one of the things I found is you just got to ask, right? You got to ask. You're going to get a lot of nos, but you might get a yes. And I happen to get a yes and you'll see some more of those videos coming out in the future. That's going to help you really just take YouTube to the next level and be able to go full time and just continue making videos. Because, let's be honest, this is way better than a real job, right? More photography. I want to do more photography. I kind of haven't been doing too much of it. I mean, especially with, you know, the way the world's been in the last two years or so. Another thing I want to do is make more digital products for you guys. Things that are going to be helpful. Things that you might be able to use that are cool that you might enjoy or that you might want to pick up and purchase. You got to give people a way to support you and support your channel. So by creating more digital projects, I think that's one way I can do that. I'm just going to enable you to go full time on YouTube. Another thing I would like to do is create some more merch stuff. Down below the videos, you always see there's t-shirts and mugs and stuff. So there's Focus. Well, this one says Kat, but says Focus and that's the name of my company, Focus Photography and Design. But I have those and honestly, nobody's bought anything the whole time I've had them there other than me. But I want to make, you know, maybe one t-shirt a month, you know, a limited run of it, maybe make 10 copies of it or whatever. And then that's it. It's done. So just something that is kind of unique, kind of interesting and, you know, can be something cool for you guys to have and be able to support the channel. And I don't know, something that I think would be kind of cool. All right, another one I want to do here, more shorts and community posts. And I had an idea to go back through all my quick tip Tuesdays and turn them all into shorts. So I might try to do that. I mean, most of them are pretty quick anyway, so I could just do a little re-edit and throw it up in a short format. So I thought that might be kind of cool. What do you think about that? Comment below. What do you think about that? All right, jumping back in the studio here. A couple more things we want to talk about with this microphone. So a little bit of information right now. What you're hearing is the microphone with no high-pass filter turned on. So we're getting all that low end in there. I don't know if it's going to sound rumbly or not. You'd be the judge and I'll hear it when I go to edit, but it should be fine. I tested it out and it seemed pretty good. I think I would most of the time leave the high-pass filter turned off because I can always adjust that in post. So now I just turned on that 75 Hertz high-pass filter. So everything below that 75 Hertz is going to get cut out and everything above is going to pass through. Now let me change it to that 150. Now here's the 150 Hertz setting. So everything greater than 150 Hertz on your EQ there is going to pass and anything below it is going to cut out. And now we are back to having no high-pass filter. So this is just straight to the mic, no high-pass filter applied. So could you hear the difference between those spots? Maybe go back, give it another listen and see what you think. So just a little distance test. I mean most of the time with a mic like this I'm going to be using it on the camera. I'm going to be holding the camera arms length right here. So I'm maybe a foot away or something like that. But let's say I back up right here is about two feet away and if I come all the way back back here it's like three feet maybe a little bit more. So you know how does that work out? I think it picked up pretty good in other situations when I was filming. I think it sounded good. I'm really impressed with this microphone. It's been doing a great job for me. One of the other things that is awesome that it actually says in the instruction books and one of the reasons why we read it is that the battery life on this thing is 120 hours. 120 hours? Is that right? Double check? 120 hours? What? That's a long time. I don't know anybody who's recording for 120 hours but it's going to last a long time for you. And that charging port on there is a USB-C. So you can always charge it from a power bank if you can plug a USB-C into it. Or if you run out of battery I believe you could just plug the power bank right into the microphone if you need to. So that's nice. 120 hours like come on son that's a lot of time right? The built-in battery is a 3.7 volt 2000 milliamp battery. So that's why you're getting such a long life out of it. Some other things that come in the box real quick. You get a dead cat that you can throw on top of there. Now I've been waiting for a windy day. It hasn't been too windy here in Jersey but as soon as there is a windy day I'm going to try this out. I don't know if it's going to make the video or not but it's nice that you get this and it's losing fuzz all over a little bit. But it's nice that you get this. It just goes right on top of the microphone. It's a great option to have on a windy day. You also get some cool little ceramonic stickers. Come on that's cool. Who doesn't love some stickers right? Throw them a toolbar. Another cool feature is that you can actually monitor your audio right through this microphone. So there's a headphone jack right on the side. You can use that if say your camera doesn't have a headphone monitoring jack. You can plug directly in the microphone and monitor your audio and just make sure you're getting a good signal and everything's coming in nice and clear. The microphone also does a great job of isolating noise coming around from the back. So if I stick my head up over here like this, can you hear me as good? No and it doesn't reject everything. Then again, no microphone really does. But it does help isolate that sound to just pick up what's in front of the camera. It does an awesome job at that. So where can you get this mic? Well you can find it on Amazon, Sweetwater, B&H, all your normal spots. It's going to cost you $250. Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I mean I think it's a fantastic mic. I think it is a more pro level mic. Hence it's going to cost more. But you're getting more performance out of it than you would a normal budget microphone. So you got to keep that in mind. Everybody's got a budget and you do need budget items sometimes. But when you're trying to level up your audio, you got to save up, do your research and figure out what is the best microphone you can get for the amount of money that you want to spend. That's how I do it. And this microphone would definitely be in the running for a on-camera microphone. That's going to be better than those, you know, like less than $100 kind of microphones. This thing is definitely a step up from that. I think it sounds a lot better. And I think it does a fantastic job. Overall guys, I got to say this microphone is awesome. Saramonic has done a fantastic job. And I got to say this is probably by far the best microphone that I've used that goes on top of a camera. It's also at the more expensive end of microphones that I've tried. So like a lot of things, you know, not only in cameras and gear and all that, a lot of times you get what you pay for, you know, you're going to spend a little bit more money on something, you're going to get a better quality product. One of the things that you'll notice with better microphones is that you don't have to edit the audio as much. The signal is cleaner, it sounds better, it's crisper. You don't have to do as much editing in post, at least from my experience. That's kind of what I found. So the V-Mic 5 Pro from Saramonic really gets the job done here. It's awesome. I'm going to be leaving this guy on top of my camera anytime I'm out and about or I need an on-camera microphone. Because this thing is awesome and it does a fantastic job. If you think this microphone is good, you're going to want to enter the contest down in the description below because Saramonic is giving me one of these guys to give away to one of you guys. So huge thank you to Saramonic for sending this microphone out for me to try out and giving us an extra one for you guys to win. So hit up the description, click on the link, go sign up for the contest and one of you guys are going to win this microphone and I guarantee you're going to love it. It's fantastic and I think it will really help bring your audio to the next level. Alright with that said, thank you again Saramonic. Thanks guys for watching. Hope you found this video helpful. And with that said, I will see you in the next one. Peace!
