What you are about to see has never been seen before. Deep within the northwest, forest lurks a creature of mystery. Don't be fooled. All of this was created with artless new AI image and video tool. Here's how it was created. First, you need an idea. I rattled my brain for something I found interesting. Sasquatch. Next, I began thinking of the scenes I want to create. Making brief notes for each scene. In all, I had 13 scene ideas. I got to work heading to art list and choosing the AI image and video tool. To start, I choose text to image a few prompts, then enhanced with AI, and an image is generated. Next, I animate that image with a few more text prompts, then animate. I repeated this process for each of the scenes. In moments, I had all the clips I needed to create the sequence. I downloaded the files, brought them into DaVinci Resolve, and got to work editing together the sequence. One more trip to art list for some epic music, a few more tweaks to the edit, and the end result is what you saw at the start of this video. That is artless new AI image and video creator tool. This thing's ridiculous. I mean, pretty much anything you can think of that you put in that text prompt, it can go ahead and create it. The process is what I showed there, where you put in a text prompt, create an image, and then you can animate that image. You've got the option of going with a 5 second clip or a 10 second clip. You can choose your resolution, either 720 or 1080. I did 1080 for these clips. Really amazing tool here that you can just think of something, anything, and put in a few prompts, and then you're going to get an AI tool that's going to create that for you. Now, while it may not give you exactly what you want every single time, you can just keep reworking it and try it again and see how it works. And I'm sure over time, these things are just going to get better and better. And AI is here to stay. So you might as well figure out how to use the tool the best that you can. Now, we still need you to be the creative one and jump in there and have the idea to prompt the AI to make these different kinds of things. So while AI is here and it can do a great job, we still need you, the creator, to use your creativity to come up with something awesome. Some really cool tools here from Artlist. I've been enjoying playing around with them and using them. And I think I'll probably use them more often too, just to create things that I can't necessarily create on my own or that might be, you know, too much of a project for me to do. I'm going to use some of the tools here on Artlist to do that. So big thank you to Artlist for sponsoring today's video. And with that said, I'm going to leave you with this AI clip and I will see you guys in the next video. Peace.
