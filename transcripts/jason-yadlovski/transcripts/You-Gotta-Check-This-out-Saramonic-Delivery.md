What's going on? Don't go anywhere. Hold on. Just, just, just wait, wait there one second. One second. Today we've got some mail time box. Check this out. We got a nice big box of some awesome goodies here from Saramonic. You don't know Saramonic. They're in the audio game. They make all kinds of great audio equipment and audio stuff and they were kind enough to send out some stuff for me to try out and test out. So today we're just going to open it up and see what they sent me and you know over time I'm going to try these things out. I'm going to make some review videos and there may even be some special things in those videos for you guys. So you want to pay attention and watch when I put out those videos. So let's open this guy up and see what we got here. It's been a little while since we did a little unbox here of some fun stuff in the mail. If you guys have watched any of my other videos, you know, love my mailman Nick, right? So let's see what we got in here. Oh buddy, check this out. What do we got here? First one we got. Oh, we got the Saramonic Super Cardioid Shotgun Mic. This is the Soundbird V6. Now this is a professional level shotgun microphone and that's what I use in my setup all the time. So really curious to give this a try and see how it compares to what I currently use. So that's pretty sweet there. That's awesome. See what else we got in here. We got the Saramonic UW-MIC 9S Kit 2. Now this is a professional wireless lav mic system and there's some really awesome features with this. So I'm excited to get in and try this one out and just really try out more professional level lav mic systems. I do have a setup that I'm using right now which works good and I've tested out a lot of other ones over the years and I always keep coming back to this setup that I have right now with the Rode lav mic because it's the most reliable and for me it works the best in my situations. I don't lose signal anything like that. So this is a pro level wireless lav mic so I'm really curious to try this out. It looks like an awesome kit. I did a little bit of research on it. Really excited to give this a try and see how it works. What else we got in here? We got some packing stuff. Ah, here we go. Look at this. They also sent out the Saramonic V-MIC 5 Pro. So this is comparable to like a, was it a Rode video mic pro? I've been looking at those for a long time and Saramonic has one that's a pro level mic as well that goes on top of your camera. So really curious to try this out. Again, I've tested a lot of these in the past. More lower end models. This is a higher end model so I'm really expecting some great things out of this guy. Excited to give that a try. See what else we got in here? We have a Saramonic female to male connector. So this is a little adapter here that you can use from TRS to a 3 pin XLR microphone. So you could basically hook up your mic like this. That's an XLR mic into a 3.5 millimeter jack like on your camera. And we also have a little microphone extension cable here that they sent out to try out. And that is it. That is exciting. Guys, I am super excited to try these things out. I'm going to be trying them out over the next, I don't know, couple weeks, month, two months, whatever it is, trying them out, sharing, you know, what I think of them, making little videos about them so that you guys can see how they do. Is it something that you want to kind of keep in your kit? And I'm trying to move towards working with more, you know, pro level equipment and stuff for myself. And I think that's something that you guys can benefit from too. Yeah, we all want budget stuff. It's important to kind of take a look at those things too. But I think it's important as you level up your game, you want to know what's better, right? How can I get better audio, better, you know, camera equipment, better setup, better everything, right? Because in this YouTube game here and in your filmmaking in general, you always want to be leveling up a little bit. You want to get better and better and better. And I think some of this equipment is going to help me level up here on YouTube as well as any other projects that I might be working on. So that is it. That's our little unbox of our mail here. Really excited. My mailman Nick, thanks for bringing this stuff out. Thank you to Saramonic for sending this stuff out. We're going to be making videos about it like I said. So stay tuned. And with that said guys, I hope you guys enjoy your day. And I'm going to go give these guys a try and start playing with these things and see how well they do. All right, with that said guys, I will see you in the next video. Peace. Got some comments. I sound like a used car salesman. I'm just a little pumped up to make videos. I mean, who wouldn't like to make videos for your job, right? Making YouTube videos helping you guys out, right? You know what I mean? This is awesome. I love doing this stuff. I'm always pumped up, fired up. And besides, would it be better if I was just like, hi guys, today we're going to look at some microphones. No, no, nobody wants that. You want energy, right? You want some energy. Anyway, all right, that's it.
