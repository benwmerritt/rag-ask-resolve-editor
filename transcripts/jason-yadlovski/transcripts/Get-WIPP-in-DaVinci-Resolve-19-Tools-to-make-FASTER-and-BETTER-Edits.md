## Transcript
We all love to edit here in DaVinci Resolve, but what if you could get the editing job done a little bit quicker and make it look a little bit better? Who doesn't want that, right? So I just wanted to take a few minutes here and tell you guys about some templates that our friend Jake Wip put together. It is a great set of templates. This video is not sponsored. I just told Jake. I'm like, hey, I think this stuff is great. So I just want to share these templates with you guys, show you some of the ones that I like, and if it's something that you need, you guys can head over to Jake's website, check it out. I'll leave a link in the description below. But I found them really helpful. They speed up my workflow and I think they're pretty darn cool too. So I've already gone ahead and installed the editor collection as well as the editor titles here. Again, Jake gave it to me for free and I'm just trying to help them out because I think these things are awesome. And I want to let you guys know about them. So in DaVinci Resolve here, I'm in the edit tab currently and in order to find these effects, I'm gonna go ahead and open up my effects library. Now we've got two different places that we can find them. We can find them under generators and you'll see whip templates and editor collection, or you can find them under effects, whip templates and editor collection. Now, what's the difference here? If I use the effect, I would click, hold and drag and drop this onto a clip. And then the effect, if I select the clip and take a look at my inspector, the effect is actually on the clip itself, which is right here. We've got all kinds of controls we can use to adjust the clip right here. Whip shake is what I just dropped on there. We can go ahead and make any changes that we want. Now, let's say I wanted that particular effect to span a couple of clips. I mean, I could copy it around, but if I don't want to do that, I'm gonna undo, I'm gonna actually come to my generators. And if I go ahead and grab the wick whip shake and drop it down in my timeline here, now I've got a clip and I can just drag this out over as many clips as I want. And then we're gonna get our shake on this clip right here and it's gonna be able to be extended over as many other clips as we want. So you've got a bunch of different cool tools in here, whip marker, whip panel, whip path, whip pivot, a whole bunch of different stuff here. One that I like that I've been using a lot in the effects section is this one whip cam. And that's how I'm making the little window here for my tutorials, right? Where I'm sitting down in the bottom corner here. I'm using the whip pan and it does a great job to just drop it onto my clip. It's got a little animated thing in, a little animated thing out. And just to show you what that looks like here, if I come on my clip and you can see I've got a transition here, let's just delete that for the moment. So if I start here, you can see as I scroll ahead, there's an automatic animation that comes with part of the whip cam, which is kind of cool, because if I didn't have a transition, then it would just be like a hard cut from the big shot down to the little shot. But by selecting on my clip here, taking a look in the inspector, we got whip cam, come to animate, I can animate it in and out really easy. You can make a ton of different changes here if you want to. You don't even have to because they're good right out of the box. But if you want to make a little change, you've got a lot of options here on things you can change with an effect like the whip cam that I use all the time. Now the other thing that has been really good and really helpful are the titles templates that Jake came up with. So if I jump under titles and I go to whip templates, there's a whole bunch of stuff in here. We've got chapters, we've got names and subtitles and different kinds of texts. We've got a ton of different titles from basic reveal titles to shaking titles. You scroll down, there's call outs. There's a ton of awesome stuff that comes in this pack and all different styles too, right? Maybe you want a particular style, you're going for a particular look. You can choose one of these guys. I really like the titles here, the cinematic titles and stuff that he came up with. And one of the big reasons that I like them, if I just take this title for example and drop it on my timeline here, is that it has some color to the titles. It's kind of cool. So if I select my title and I come into my inspector, right? Open your inspector. We can add in whatever text we want. I'm just going to say Jason Yolovsky, audio guru. And you notice here, okay, we've got some blue going on the text. It looks a little weird. Well, we can just adjust that really quick and easy. If I come down to accent color here, all I have to do is drag on the right on slider and I can change it to show wherever I want. I could even key frame it if I want. I could change the color by picking any color in the color wheel that I might want. Say we go with YouTube red, you can use the sliders here to change it if you want. You've got shadow controls built right in. Boom, I can turn on the shadow. So if I was on a white background, boom, just turn on the shadow. It can make it darker or lighter, softer or harder, depending on what you want. You can change the animation a little bit if you want. Change the mid animation if you want that. A lot of different stuff that you could do here. I like that it's just got a little different color in there that I can use. It just changes it up a little bit and makes it something a little bit different, right? Obviously, I could change the font to whatever I might want it to be. You could pick anything that you want. But he's got a lot of good titles in here that do all kinds of different things. There's even clean titles in here. I mean, there's a whole bunch. I didn't count them, so I don't know how many there are. You can even use a logo with some of these different animated templates. There's credits and different ways that you can show, you know, who helped out on your video. All kinds of good stuff. You've got modern titles here, tons of different modern titles that are all customizable. It's really easy to make some changes to the different titles that all come together in this pack. And for the price that you pay to get all these templates, like it's pretty ridiculous. They're really good. I've been using them a lot on all my videos because they just help speed up the process of editing. He's got a ton of great effects there. I don't have to reinvent the wheel and go ahead and create all these different things from scratch. I can just use some of these templates, make some little changes to customize it to look however I want. And I'm often running with my videos to make them awesome. So if you're looking for some templates to get your editing to the next level, bring up your, your, the look of your videos, make it a little bit quicker and easier to edit. You want to check out Jake's templates. I'll leave a link in description below. Jump over there, check it out. Again, this is not sponsored. I'm just trying to help Jake out because he made some awesome products here for us to use in DaVinci Resolve and I want to see him succeed. I want to see all you guys out there succeed. So I want to do my part and help each and every one of you out. All right guys, with that said, I will see you in the next video. Peace.
