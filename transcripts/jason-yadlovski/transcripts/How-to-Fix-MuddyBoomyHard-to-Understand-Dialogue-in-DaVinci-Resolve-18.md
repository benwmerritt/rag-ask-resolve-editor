Have you ever had some audio in your video and it just sounds a little muddy, it's not quite clear, a little too boomy sounding? Today I've got an example, I'm going to show you how we can quickly and easily get rid of that muddiness and boominess from your audio. Let's jump into Resolve and I'll show you how to do it. So in DaVinci Resolve here, I have an example I want to play for you and I want you to listen to the way the audio sounds. It's going to sound a little bit muddy, a little bit boomy and we want to take care of that. And then I'm going to show you how easy it is to take care of that muddiness and boomyness in your audio. So one of the things that lav mics are notorious for is needing some EQ work and in this sample you're going to hear it sounds a little bit boomy, like there's too much low end, it's a little bit muddy sounding and I'm going to show you how you can fix that up using two different methods. So let's jump into Resolve and I'll show you how to take care of the boomyness and that muddy sound in our audio. So you heard it sound like it's got too much low end in there, right? It's a little boomy, a little muddy and we want to take care of that. And I find that lav mics are notorious for having this problem. So we could do it on our clip level here in the edit tab, which is where I am right now and we can use the EQ that is in our audio section if we open our inspector audio and equalizer right here. But I want to jump into Fairlight and do it in Fairlight because I like the EQ there and it's on a whole track level. So we're going to jump into Fairlight, musical notes at the bottom here. I'm just going to go ahead and close my inspector and you want to make sure that you have your mixer open. Right here is our mixer. If you don't see your mixer at the top of the screen here, we've got our mixer. So I want to click on my track one and I want to open up my EQ. Now the easiest way to do this is to come to our band one. We're going to go ahead and turn that on and as we play through our clip, we're just going to grab this dial right here and we're going to roll it on up until it sounds like it's not so muddy and not so boomy. And what this is going to do is remove some of those lower end frequencies that are causing that muddiness and boomyness sound in our audio. So I'm going to bring the point number one all the way back and again, you can just click on it, hold and drag it around, bring it all the way back. I'm going to start playing through my clip and then I'm just going to bring that up until it sounds better to my ear. So let's go ahead and play through it. So one of the things that lab mics are notorious for is needing some EQ work and in this sample you're going to hear it sounds a little bit boomy like there's too much low end. It's a little bit muddy sounding and I'm going to show you how you. So that's sounding better right there, but you don't want to go too far because then it's going to sound too thin, right? And unnatural. So let me just show you what that sounds like. If you go too far, here's kind of what it sounds like. You can fix that up using two different methods. So let's jump in and resolve and I'll show you how to take care of the boomyness and that. Okay, so you can hear how it's a little different there. It's a little too thin. So I'm going to bring this back and if you only wanted to use one point here, you're a little intimidated by the EQ. You can just use this one point and that should help out quite a bit. So let's just get this guy set where we want it to be by playing through our clip again and just making some small adjustments. One of the things that lab mics are notorious for is needing some EQ work. And in this sample, you're going to hear it sounds a little bit boomy, like there's too much low end. It's a little bit muddy sounding and I'm going to show you how you. Okay, so I think that's pretty good. And if you wanted to leave it there or even maybe bring this up a little bit higher, you're good to go. But let's say maybe it sounded better, but it still sounds a little bit boomy. Like I think this clip does. Here's another thing that you can do. You can leave your band number one here that we already set, leave it as it is. And then we can come to our band number two. I want to change the type to be a bell curve, which is the second guy down right here. So I'm going to go ahead and click on that. Now with my point two, if I click hold and drag this point up, you can see it makes a little peak. I drag it down. It, it makes a peak going down. So what we want to do is find a frequency where that boominous or that extra boominous is coming from. And a lot of times you're going to find that frequency in the 250 Hertz range, give a little take a little somewhere in that range. If you reduce your frequencies, it's going to help clean up that audio for you. And just a side note, always keep in mind that you generally want to reduce frequencies or cut frequencies before you ever boost anything when it comes to EQ work. That's going to help clean up your audio a whole lot better than if you tried to boost levels up. You want to make cuts, not boosts. And that's not to say you never want to boost. There are times when you do, but for the most part, you want to make cuts on your EQ. So I'm going to grab my point. Number two, play through the clip and see if I can find that little bit of extra boominous and drop it out. So one of the things that lab mics are notorious for is maybe some EQ work. And in this sample, you're going to hear it sounds a little bit boomy, like there's too much. Okay. So what I did there was first I raised that point up so I could find a part that sounds harsh to my ears. Once I found that harsh part, then I reduced the frequency and you can see for me, it looks like it's around 280. And let me just play a little before and after. You can see how these two simple changes on the EQ really cleaned up our clip. So we're going to start with it often, then I'll turn it on as we play through the clip. So one of the things that lab mics are notorious for is needing some EQ work. And in this sample, you're going to hear it sounds a little bit boomy. Like, can you hear the difference there? How we kind of cleaned it up? It doesn't sound as boomy. Now you do want some low end to your clips because if you don't, it's going to sound too thin, but you don't want too much because depending on how you're listening to it, it may just sound too boomy and too bassy, right? We want to remove some of those lower end frequencies. And as a little bonus tip here with that band number one, when you apply that in the way that we did, that's called a high pass filter. Everything below our point gets cut out and everything above is allowed to pass through. And in general, I use that on pretty much every dialogue track that I use. A high pass filter can really help just get rid of unwanted lower end frequencies in your audio. So there you go. Now your audio is going to be sounding a little bit better, a little bit cleaner and a little bit easier for your audience to understand. Now if you want to increase the clarity and the crispness of your voice a little bit, you might want to check out the video over here. That's going to show you exactly how to do that. Thanks for watching guys. I will see you in the next video. Peace.
