To normalize or not to normalize? That is the question. And what got me thinking about that question is a video I put out just today talking about how we can improve the dynamics of our audio just to create a better listening experience for our viewers. And somebody had a great comment on the video. They said, well, hey, can I just normalize my audio? Isn't that the same thing as working with the dynamics that you're doing in this video? And the answer is no, normalizing your audio is not working with your dynamics at all. And to say it best, I think I should just tell you exactly what the DaVinci Resolve manual says on page 3668. It says this, the change made by the normalize audio volume command is only a volume adjustment. No dynamics are applied. So the result of using this command is that the loudest parts of each clip are going to match one another at the target level. So that's directly out of the manual. Now, what does that mean? Well, if we take a look into Venturi's off, let's jump in there real quick. So what normalization is, in case you're not familiar with it, you come to your clip either in the edit tab or in Fairlight, you can right click on it, and we have normalize audio levels. Now, when we go ahead and open that up, we've got different ways we can normalize our audio. And if we click this little dropdown, you can see there's all these different methods of normalizing our audio, Netflix, YouTube, Disney, all kinds of different ways to do it. So let's say, for example, I pick the YouTube one. And now it's going to show me that the target level is minus one dBTP. And the target loudness is minus 14 lofts or LKFS. So I can go ahead and hit normalize on here, but watch what's going to happen to my waveforms here. And hit normalize. It's going to analyze the clip. Now, it did meet those target levels that we talked about, right? But look at what we have here, the way that the waveforms look so our louder parts of our clip right here in the beginning versus our quiet parts, the ratio is the same. It just took everything and expanded up our waveforms relative to each other. It didn't apply any dynamics. Now, if we were to use something like the compressor, for example, and just to show you kind of what it would look like here, if we did use the compressor, I'm going to make my track a little bit bigger here so we can see it a little bit better. A compressor kind of does something that looks like this, right? It's going to compress the louder parts, right? So I'm just going to add some keyframes to demonstrate what the compressor is doing. So I'm going to add a keyframes on either side of our quiet parts there. So a compressor is essentially going to bring down the loud parts a little bit. And if you use the makeup slider in the compressor, it's going to bring up the quiet parts, right? So what we're getting is a more even audio track here for our dialogue. So if I bring that down a little bit, if I just zoom out. So now you can see our dialogue track looks a little bit more even than it originally did, even though we normalized it because normalizing is only changing the volume, right? We're not adding any kind of dynamics in there. If we jump over into Fairlight real quick, Fairlight right here, I've got my clip right here and I kind of just demonstrated kind of what a compressor is doing, okay? It's not actually keyframing stuff. But if I copy this down into a new track here, and I'm just going to select my audio clip here, I'm going to right click and say remove attributes, then I'm going to remove everything that's on there. We're back to normal. So when it comes to dynamics, let's say on track two here, I was going to work with some dynamics. So I would come into my mixer, mixer right here, double click our dynamics. Now I would turn on the compressor, right? So the compressor allows me to limit the loud parts a little bit. And then by using the makeup slider right here, I can make the quiet parts a little bit louder. Grab my headphones here so we can hear the difference. So let's do this. We are going to apply dynamics to our bottom clip right here. See how that sounds. And then compare that to the normalized clip and see how that sounds. I'm going to mute my track number one here because we're only working with our second track currently. I'm going to play through it. I'm going to set my dynamics in a range that I think sounds good. I'm going to make the quiet parts a little louder. I'm going to make the loud parts a little bit quieter and kind of get a more balanced type of audio or dialogue from this track. So here we go. So I'm going to make the loud parts a little farther away. Maybe they just decide to talk a little bit quieter because I got to tell you something about the game that's going on here that I don't want everybody else to know about. Well for your viewer, they may need to adjust the volume on your video. And if they're a little farther away, maybe they just decide to talk a little bit quieter because I got to tell you something about the game that's going on here that I don't want everybody else to know about. Well for your viewer, they may need to adjust the volume on your video and you don't want them to have to do that. So we can use compression here in DaVinci Resolve to help reduce our dynamic range and make it a better listening experience. Okay, so there we go. Now I just edited the audio. I applied a little bit of compression, a little bit of makeup there to make the quiet parts louder. And this is the kind of result we have. So let's go back to our first clip here. I'm going to close my dynamics window. And I'm just going to go ahead and reset everything here. I'm going to remove attributes, remove everything, apply. And now I'm just going to right click and we're going to go normalize audio levels. I'm going to choose the YouTube standard here and see what we get. So I'm going to go ahead and hit normalize. So now you can see everything got increased, but it's all kind of relative to each other, right? Our middle section here with the quieter audio didn't get any different. But let's listen to it and see how it sounds. So I'm going to just solo out my first track here. Let's see how it sounds. So sometimes in our videos, we talk loud like this. We set our levels based on us talking loud or our subject talking loud. But then there's times where people maybe they're a little farther away. Maybe they just decide to talk a little bit quieter because I got to tell you something about the game that's going on here that I don't want everybody else to know about. Well, for your viewers, they may need to adjust the volume on your video and you don't want them to have to do that. So we can use compression here in DaVinci Resolve. So that's what it sounds like normalized. Now let's try it again with the dynamics one. Let's hear that track again. I'm going to mute the track one, solo track two. Here's how it sounds with dynamics and how I would adjust the levels. So sometimes in our videos, we talk loud like this. We set our levels based on us talking loud or our subject talking loud. But then there's times where people maybe they're a little farther away. Maybe they just decide to talk a little bit quieter because I got to tell you something about the game that's going on here that I don't want everybody else to know about. Well, for your viewers, they may need to adjust the volume on your video and you don't want them to have to do that. So can you hear the difference there? In the first example, it normalized. Yeah, but it pushed everything way up, right? So the loud parts got quite a bit louder. And yeah, we can hear the quiet parts a little bit better, but it doesn't sound as balanced as it does if you use some of the dynamics there when you combine compression with the makeup, right? And for me, if I were to look at track number one here, I'm actually going to mute my audio here, I'm going to come back and I'm going to unmute my track so we can just watch the meters here. But look at where track number one is versus track number two. Track number one is getting way up there. Like when I'm editing my dialogue levels, I don't want it to be that high. Now I could pick a different method of normalizing and it might work a little bit better. But the technique is going to be similar where it's going to adjust all the volume of those clips relative to each other, right? It's not going to make the quiet parts a little louder and make the loud parts a little quieter and kind of balance it. It's just going to take everything and adjust it based on the method that you pick, whether it's the peak program, the sample program, or Netflix, Disney, whatever. We can even try, looking in Resolve here, try a different one, Normalize Audio Levels. If I go to, let's say, Netflix. Right, now it brings everything way down, but it's all still relative to each other, so it doesn't affect the dynamics of your clip. It only affects the volume and it says that right in the DaVinci Resolve manual. So I think normalizing, if you don't know anything about audio, is a fine place to start. Go ahead, do it, pop it on there. It's going to help you at least get some good basic levels and stuff. But I would prefer myself as an audio guide to jump in there and use the dynamics a little bit. But I think it's an important distinction that normalizing is not the same as using the dynamics panel, using compression, using the makeup slider there. It's not the same thing. Can it help your audio? Absolutely, yes, it can definitely help your audio. And it's a great way to get started. But if you really want to fine tune stuff, the dynamics panel is the way to go. It just gives you more control over what that audio sounds like, adjusting your levels, and just really doing it the way that you want to do it, and the way that you want your audio to sound, and meeting those levels that you want to meet. So just some quick thoughts there on normalizing your audio versus using the dynamics, compression, makeup. They're different, and it's important that you guys kind of understand a little bit of the difference there. So I hope this was helpful and just kind of clarifying it a little bit. If you want to know more about it, let me know. If you've got questions, let me know. Drop a comment down below. I'm happy to try and answer any questions that you guys might have. The other thing I did want to mention real quickly with the normalization is that you can normalize the entire track to one level, or you can normalize every individual clip on the entire track. So you've got that option too, to kind of set things individually or relative to each other. But still, if you really want the ability to fine-tune things and really make it the way that you want, the way to do it is with your dynamics, using compression, using a little bit of the makeup there, and just kind of balancing everything out better. So that way, your viewer has a better viewing experience while they're watching your videos. Alright, with that said, I am done. I am out of here, guys. I will see you in the next video. Peace.
