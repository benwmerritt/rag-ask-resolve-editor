We're going to use four nodes here in Fusion to make that effect that you just saw there and exploding logo. My name is Jason Dielofsky, let's jump into it. So the first thing I'm going to show you how to do is create this effect with a logo. Once we create that, you're going to be able to use this and really just swap out the logo for any image that you might want or any video clip that you might want. In resolve here, I want to get started in the edit page and I want to start by adding in a fusion composition. So I'm going to come to my effects library here. I'm going to come to your effects and grab a fusion composition and drop it down in my timeline. Now you can adjust the length of this based on however long you might want this effect to be. Let's say I want it to be four seconds. I'm going to hold my shift key one, two, three, four clicks of my arrow. That's four seconds. I'm just going to shorten up the fusion clip, put my play head over the clip and let's jump over into fusion. Now in fusion here, I'm going to show you how we can do this with a logo, the DaVinciresolve logo. But once we create the set of nodes, you can swap out that logo or even put a video in there and I'll show you how to do that later on. But let's get started here and create this cool effect. So the first thing that I need to do is bring down my logo into my node area here. So I'm going to grab my DaVinciresolve logo, bring it down into my nodes, drop it in. So we've got our media node. And if I press a number one on here, now we can see what that looks like. And we have our media out, which is in our second viewer here. I'm going to close my media pool. And now we're going to add in a few different nodes that are going to help us create this cool effect. I'm going to start by selecting my median one, and I want to press shift in spacebar. And that's going to bring up our tool that allows us to search for different nodes. And I want to search for the P image emitter. So we want this guy right here. I'm going to click add. The next node that we want to add, if we have our P image emitter selected here is P turbulence. So again, I'm going to hit shift spacebar search for P turbulence. You're going to add that in there. And now we need a renderer to render all this out for us. So again, I'm going to make sure my P turbulence is selected, shift spacebar. I'm going to add in a P render. And then I'm just going to connect that to our media out. And once I do that, it's going to think a little bit. And you notice we've already got a little something going on here. So I'm going to move my playhead back to the beginning of our clip here. And when I look at it, it doesn't quite look right, right? It's not exactly what we're looking for here. So a couple things. One, the logo is too big, right? We need to shrink it down. So let's take care of that first. I'm going to pull out my median one a little bit here, select my median one. I'm going to add in a transform node, which is this guy right here. And now we can just select our transform, come to our inspector right here. And I'm going to grab the size and just scale it down so that it fits in my window right here. Perfect. That's exactly what I want. Next, I'm going to come over to my image emitter in my image emitter here over in the inspector. We want to come to style and where it says point right here for style, we want to click the drop down and we want to say blob. After you selected blob right here, we want to come down to size control, open that up and under size, we want to crank this one all the way up. And that's going to make it look solid for us. As you've increased the size, come on back to our controls right here. And we want to make a couple changes in here. Under random seed, you can crank this up as high as you want. Let's say we go with somewhere around 205. The lifespan of the particles, we want to adjust that a little bit. I want to bring up some variants. And you're going to be able to change this to your liking once we kind of get things set up here. But if you do move your playhead forward a little bit, it'll give it a chance to kind of render up and you can kind of see what it's starting to look like there. You can adjust the lifespan here if you want to. Next, let's come down to velocity and open that up. And we want to increase the velocity a little bit as well as the velocity variants. And now you can see we're starting to get that particle look, right? So you can play with these and kind of set them where you like them. And if you want it to look like it moves slower, you're going to use a lower velocity. If you want it to look like it moves faster, you're going to want to use a higher velocity. So if I come back on my timeline and we kind of just go ahead frame by frame here, it looks like it expands out to the left and right. Now under the variants down here, we want to change our angle Z variants to minus 90. So let's go ahead and click on that. And that's going to allow it to look like it's kind of expanding out off the screen. So if we just jump ahead a few frames here, we can see it looks like it's kind of expanding out as it renders up a little bit there. So that's the kind of look that we're going for. So now we're starting to get that exploding effect that we're looking for, but we want to add a little bit more variation into the particles starting to fly out. And that's where our P turbulence comes in. So we're going to select our P turbulence, come up to our inspector. We can add in some random seed here. We can also increase the strength a little bit. You can again, all this is to taste, you can just pick some numbers. Maybe you want to go with like 0.4 to start here. We could just make all these 0.4. And then the density, if you want to increase that a little bit, you can also increase that. Now it's going to be a little slow playing back here in your timeline, at least it is for me because this is taking a lot of processor power for your computer. If you click at different points along your timeline here, you can see what's starting to happen here with your particular logo and how it's starting to look. Now, if you've got a stronger computer than me, you may even be able to play right through this. One thing that's going to help you is if you come on up to playback, go to render cache and make sure smart is selected. It should start to render some of this stuff in the edit page in the background. So if we jump back into the edit page real quick, you'll see this red line up here when you have smart selected. And that's going to say DaVinci Resolve is rendering or processing that in the background. And when that line turns blue, you should be able to play through it without any problems. So it looks like my line turned blue here. Let's go ahead and play through it and see what it looks like in our viewer here. Pretty good. I like it. So you can go through and just any of those settings that you want to to get the desired look and the desired like explosion pattern and particle pattern and stuff. You can play with those couple of settings that we already talked about and that's going to change the way that it looks for you. Now you might notice that the logo still looks a little bit fuzzy here right in the beginning, right? So before I tell you why Artlist wants to give you $100,000, let me show you how we can fix this. In the edit page here, we're going to kind of do a quick fix here. So this isn't as sharp as it should be, right? But what I'm going to do is slide over my Fusion Clip and I want to actually bring that logo into my timeline again. So I'm going to come to my media pool, grab my DaVinci Resolve logo, drop it in the timeline. And now I did change the size of my logo in my Fusion Clip here. So I want to make sure that they match up. And in order to do that, first step is bring this guy, our logo clip above our other clip. I'm going to select our logo clip, I'm going to drop the opacity a little bit. And now I'm going to scale it down to make sure it's the same size as the logo in our Fusion Clip. So that looks pretty good. I'm going to bring it back to the beginning of my timeline, bring my Fusion Clip over, make sure I put the opacity back up here on my logo. So now if I just play through my clip, it's going to play the logo and then it'll just go into our little explosion pattern here for the logo. And this is what it looks like. So now that you got the basics of how to get this cool effect set up, I'm going to show you how you can swap out the logo really easy, as well as a swap in a video clip so that you could do something that looks kind of cool like this. But first, I want to talk to you about the Artless 100K fund for 2024. Artless is excited to announce the return of the Artless $100,000 fund. It's a unique grant that offers one creator $100,000 to bring their most ambitious creative ideas to life. This is a huge opportunity for creators, filmmakers, and independent creative teams to bring their wildest video ideas to life. So what does all that mean for you? That means that you should come up with an awesome idea where you can spend $100,000 that Artless wants to give you to create some kind of awesome project of your choice. And if you want all the details on how it all works, what you got to do, all the other stuff that you might want to know or have questions on, jump on over to the Artless website and check it out. They've got a Q and A section over there that'll help answer all the questions that you have. I'll link it down below if you're interested in checking it out. But I look at it this way. What do you got to lose? You submit something there. Maybe you can bring your cool idea to life. Now let's jump back into Fusion and I'm going to show you how we can swap out our logo for pretty much any image that we might want and how we can add in a video clip to do something cool like this. So in resolve, we've already got our Fusion comp set up here, but let's say I want to swap out that logo. So I'm going to select my Fusion comp, jump back into Fusion. And all I have to do is just disconnect my median one here and then just put something else in there. So I'm going to hold shift, select my median one, and it just disconnects for me. Now I'm going to go find a new image. A PNG would work great if you want some transparency. So I'm going to go find a new image here. Let's say in this case, I've got the art list logo. I'm going to drag it down into my node area, connect it up, give it a second to render up, and then we are going to have the same effect there already to go with our new logo. And here's what that looks like. Now keep in mind, you may need to adjust some settings, but just dropping in a new logo. Here's what that looks like. Now keep in mind, you can always adjust your transform node here if you need to change the size of your particular image there. We can maybe want to bring it up a little bit. You can do that. No problem. And it may take a little bit for it to render out. It took a little while on my end here, but that's how you can swap out your image with any other image that you might want. In the edit tab here, let's make me disappear into a bunch of particles. This is fun. So I have two clips in my timeline. One is of me in the shot where I snap my fingers and then I'm going to turn into particles. And then I've got another one where it is just the background, kind of like a clean plate there. And I filmed them both. So, uh, you know, I want to be able to match them up, make sure your camera doesn't move, you know, that kind of stuff. So I'm going to turn this back on. Let's go ahead and make a cut right where I snap like that. I'm going to make a little cut right here. And on this section right here is where I want the, um, particle thing to happen and have me kind of disappear. So I'm going to select this clip, right click, say new fusion clip. Next I'm going to jump over into fusion. Now in fusion here, we need to do a couple of things. First, first we got to isolate myself, right? And I'm using studio. So I'm going to make use of the magic mask here. If you didn't have the magic mask, you'd have to rotoscope it all out and all that kind of stuff. But since I have studio, the easiest way to do it is to select my first node, shift space bar. We're going to say magic mask right here. Going to add that in. Now I want to just paint over myself. So we're going to draw some lines here over myself. And then we're going to go ahead and select better. And we're going to track this forward and backward. So I'm going to go ahead and hit that. Now we could add in the background. So you see it all here in fusion and have multiple clips, but in this case, I'm just going to do the, uh, the, the explosion thing with myself here, but you can add in the other clips. I tried it that way too. It does work out just fine. Just a little more processing on your computer, but should be just fine. So if you've already created the bunch of nodes that we've shown before that we worked with, with our logo and any other graphic that you might have, you can just go over to that clip, copy them by selecting them all, control C. And then control V or command V to paste them in here. And we've got all of our settings. They're the exact same nodes. So we can just go ahead and connect them up and move these two guys out a little bit, going to connect our magic mask into our transform. And in this case for the transform, I'm just going to reset this to zero. So I'm going to come in and double click on my size here. And then I'm going to have the P render go to our output. And it may take a few seconds for this to all load up here, but then we should see myself here kind of turning into a bunch of particles, right? So you can go into any of these items that we've already changed and make any changes that you might want to. So I'll just go ahead, change a couple of things. And now I'm going to jump back into the edit tab. And I'm just going to give resolve a minute to pre-render up our fusion clip here. So that way we could play back through it without any issues. Now, because I use the magic mask, it did make an alpha channel there automatically. So we're going to see our other clip right underneath me kind of exploding here into particles and looking in my timeline, I did leave a little clip of me in the beginning here. So it's going to look clear. And when I snap my fingers, then we should start to turn into the particles. All right, we've got our blue line here. Let's go ahead and play through the beginning of our clip and see what it looks like. So there you go. What do you think about that? Pretty cool, right? Turn yourself into a bunch of particles with only four nodes in fusion. Really easy stuff here. So if you guys liked this video, go ahead and hit that thumbs up button for me. Make sure that you guys put together an idea and submit it online for that 100k giveaway from Artlist. Who wouldn't want to win $100,000, right? So put your ideas out there. Hey, maybe you'll win. You'll be able to make something really cool and get 100k to do it from Artlist. So with that said, guys, thanks so much for tuning in for a little bit of easy fusion here and I will see you in the next video. Peace.
