When it comes to enjoying the beautiful outdoors or maybe just you need a little peace and quiet a good pair of headphones is a must and you know you might have like I do a little white pair of headphones that the company sounds like a fruit and you might think that they're the best that you can get and I'm here to just give you guys a little information about another pair of headphones that in my opinion sound a whole lot better and that is the Sand Sound Sandware headphones. These things are great. I'm just gonna tell you a little bit about them here today and we're gonna do a little unbox you can see what comes with them. They're not cheap I'll give you that but the sound on these things are ridiculous. I mean you can hear the low basses all the way up to the high highs and everything in between. When you go back and forth between this and other headphones in my opinion and I've been trying these out for months it does a huge difference. These guys sound really good it's crisp it's clear the bass I mean the low end that you get on these things is ridiculous. I was I couldn't believe it I was blown away by how well these things sound. They do a really good job of isolating the outside sound now they don't have you know active noise reduction or anything like that but they do a really good job of isolating the sound from the air ambient noise that might you know interfere or get in the way with whatever you're listening to. I've used these headphones on everything from my phone that I'm using right now I've used them on phone calls I've hooked them up to my computer I've hooked them up to other devices to Nintendo Switch for example and they do a great job all around. I mean they fit my ear good they stay in my ear which is surprising a lot of headphones that I've tried in the past that go in your ear they don't stay in very well they kind of fall out and you know especially if I'm running or exercising or something they fall out but the way these things are designed they just don't fall out and I'll show you you know when I take them off we get back in the studio show you the parts of pieces and kind of how they go in your ear there you'll see why they don't fall out right and they come with a bunch of different sizes and things that you can use to get to stay in your ear properly and that's been really good for me because I've always had trouble with the earbuds staying in my ear so I really like that they actually stay in my ear and they've worked excellent on all kinds of different devices and the quality of the sound it's really hard to describe but I've been going back and forth between other earbuds I have little white ones that shall remain nameless and these guys and there's a big difference you know when it comes to the sound especially of music and those low-end you know bass type frequencies that you just don't get with earbuds normally these guys do an awesome job back in the studio let's just talk about what comes with these headphones like I said I mean I can't tell you how good these things sound they sound so good one other thing just to tell you how good they sound and kind of explain it a little bit I've put on movies and listen to movies on these and these things do a great job of just giving you that spatial audio sound and it doesn't sound weird like some headphones you turn on the spatial audio and like it just sounds a little weird right kind of not not what I would consider normal these things make audio sound spatially all the way around you up down everywhere without sounding weird I mean they do a great job I'm really impressed and I know I just kind of keep saying I'm impressed and how good they are but that's because I really think that they do a good job so opening up our box here you would just pull the little tab and it's gonna open up the box you've got your headphones here in the middle and then on the sides we've got different headphone adapters for the part that goes in your ear along with the part over here that goes on like the outside of your ear and this part that goes on the outside of your ear here this is why these don't fall out of my ear while I'm running exercising jogging doing any physical you know activity where I'm moving around maybe even some yard work I do that often with these headphones but they do a really good job of keeping them in your ear so the really cool features about these headphones is one that this is the charging case so you're gonna charge up this guy right here and then when you plug in the headphones they're gonna charge from this device so it's got USB-C on the back here and you can use that to charge it up and they last long I've never had these die on me yet since I've charged them up I mean I do use them a bunch of times then I'll charge them up so it whoops as I drop them there and look they're very durable and they even have lights on the inside which is so cool check that out I take that out got blue lights on the inside how cool is that right this thing lights up everywhere and they're pretty durable like as you saw I just dropped it no problem I mean these things are built really well like for what they are they they work really good they're solid I just I like them a lot I mean I think you guys can tell that right now the other thing that you do get with these is obviously instruction booklet you get a cool little sandware pouch here you got that that you can put them in when you're not using them you also get a little USB charging cord and you get this a lanyard right so we can put this through the back here and then you can just hang it wear it like this on your shirt if you want or hanging on whatever you might want to hang it on but a lot of people gonna put this lanyard on and it's just gonna hang here and then you got your headphones right there although I haven't used the lanyard much I usually just pop this in my pocket I like the idea this because if I'm going out running or something I don't really have pockets but I want to bring this just in case I need it got take on my headphones it's good to just kind of throw this on and I think you could do a great job if you just want to wear it as like a lanyard instead of sticking it in your pocket or something I have tried using this for some audio and video editing and it I mean it sounds great there too it does a great job just as good as any other headphones that I've used you know the old big over-the-ear cans these do a great job because they isolate the sound really well and they replicate the sound really well so I editing with these no problem now if you're saying well hey what if I got a little bit of latency in there when I'm working with my headphones because you might notice that because they're connected through Bluetooth well Sandware actually has another device that you could use to hook up your computer that drops that latency way down so that it's not noticeable I haven't tried that but I've heard that it works really well and if you're experiencing latency issues and you want to edit with these you can go ahead use that and that's gonna help kind of take care of that problem for you another cool feature of these particular headphones is that there's an app that comes with it that allows you to do a whole bunch of different things if I just grab my phone here we're gonna connect these to my phone through Bluetooth you're gonna get a little thing on the screen here and it is gonna want to connect them it'll search around you'll find it when you see it this little icon that looks like this will pop up on your screen you can just drag it down and connect it and now you've got different options that you can do it shows you your battery life in here you can change the colors on it so if I hit this little button right here it's gonna change the luminance control on it I can change the way it looks make it white make it red it's gonna flash and do all kinds of cool stuff but in the app you can also come to this middle icon here here's the EQ you can change it however you want there's a couple presets along the top here and you just make it sound however you'd like it to sound then in the last little icon here you've got all the different gestures that you can use on your right and left sides to do different things like play pause previous song voice assist and volume you can change it however you want or you can just go ahead and use the default settings you can also update these guys if you need to you can see on the screen here I've got an update so it's going ahead and doing an update for me so a lot of good tools in that app most of time you don't have to jump in there too often at least from what I found I just hook them up to my phone I'll listen to music I'll use them to edit on my computer or any other device that you know I mentioned earlier in the video there switch whatever I'll hook it up to whatever and it always does a great job these things sound really good so if you're looking for some kind of headphones you want to level up a little bit from you know other types of headphones that many of us have you might know what I'm talking about then I think these are a great option they do a awesome job a really great job of creating that spatial audio sound and hearing things like in different spaces more so than other headphones that I've tried and that's just from throwing on some Netflix or throwing on some watching Richard anybody watch Richard so you've got all kinds of stuff flying around your head there in some of those scenes and it does a great job with the way that sounds and the way it comes across in your ears they're good they're great and I've been using them for a few months I think I got these back in November I want to say so I've been using them for a bunch of months here back and forth between other kinds of headphones really impressed and we're did an awesome job with these guys so if you're looking to level up your headphones you might want to check out these sandware ones
