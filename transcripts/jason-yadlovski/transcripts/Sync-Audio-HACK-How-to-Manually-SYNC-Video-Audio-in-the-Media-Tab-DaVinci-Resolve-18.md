What's going on guys, welcome back to another quick tip Tuesday on the channel. Today we're talking about how you can manually sync up your audio and video if, for example, you recorded your video and it had no audio, nothing. No scratch audio, not a sound, not a peep, nothing. But you recorded your audio say on a boom mic or maybe an external recorder or something like that. How can we sync those up, right? Resolve won't automatically sync it for us or do the auto sync because there's no scratch audio. So we can do it right in the media tab. That's right, the media tab, we don't even have to jump into fair light, the media tab, we can sync up our video and our audio before we grab that clip and bring it into our timeline. So let's get into resolve here, check out the media tab and how we can sync our audio and video when our video has got no sound. Let's go jumping right into the venture resolve. We are going to sync this video and audio in the media tab. That's right, not fair light, not the edit tab in the media tab. So the media tab is all the way over here on the left. Now I have my audio clip as well as my video clip in my bin already, which is called tutorial because this is a tutorial. So here's the first thing you want to do double click on your video clip. And you want to come up to your viewer here and find the spot where you're able to have a sync point. So for me, I clapped my hands five times, I think it was, and I want to set my playhead right where that first clap starts. So I'm going to go ahead and use my arrow keys to get that playhead right there. Boom. That's where the clap starts. Okay, so now leave that where it is. The next thing you want to do is open your audio clip. So double click on your audio clip. Now you can see it in the viewer right up here, but where we're actually going to want to take a look at it is over here. So make sure the audio window is open and make sure we have waveform selected. So this is going to show us our waveform of this audio clip. Now in this view on the side, and notice it went back to my video clip here, but that's okay. In this viewer on the side over here, we want to move this playhead back to that sync point that's going to sync up with our video clip. So all the way back, I want it to sync with this first clap right here. And I'm going to use my arrow keys to get it right to the spot. Right there looks good. Now once we have that set, I'm going to click back on my video clip. Now you need to have the video clip you want to sync with selected. So keep that in mind. So I have my clip selected. Now I'm just going to click this little link icon right here. It says link unlink audio. Boom. And now that audio is linked with that particular video clip. So now if I just come back and click on my clip, claps to sync up our audio with our video. All right. So now it's synced up that audio is tied to that video clip. It's linked. It's not tied. It's linked. So let's jump over into the edit tab here. So now let's just drop that clip in the timeline and see how it sounds. We should be able to use those hand claps to sync up our audio with our video. And there you go. That is manually syncing your video with no audio and your audio syncing them together right in the media tab. So it's good to go before you even drop it in the timeline. And that sounds like I'm getting some messages. So on that note, I'm going to be out of here guys and I will see you in the next video. Peace.
