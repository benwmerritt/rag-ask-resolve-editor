What's happening guys? We are on our way to New York City today going to NYNAB. So you know it's like the smaller version of NAB in Vegas there. So on my way in, gonna catch the train in because I don't want to drive in. That's no fun. So yeah looking forward to it. Gonna meet up with Blackmagic and some other companies that you know might be there. I'm not sure who all is gonna be there but you know probably meet up with some people that I know. Kind of show a little FaceTime if you will. And maybe I'll make it out to Vegas to the big big one. Went out there a few years ago and that one's huge. That was cool. But yeah about to catch a train here so yeah I'll show you a little bit of what's going on there. What's happening and what it's all about at NYNAB here. See you in the city. All right hooping it getting there. A few more blocks to go. A few more blocks to go. Last square garden Penn Station down to the Javits Center. Set the street here. We're almost there so be there soon. Just about to the Javits Center here but wondering how big this place actually is. Gonna give you a quick pan of it. It's huge. Not as big as the biggest convention center but is big. Let's see if there's a ramp time to get out of here. Let's go. One of my favorite spots. Modern bread and bagel. This bagel is a little freak. Let's get back on the train. A little coffee. Got my bagels ready. It is a wrap for a NYCNAB. It was pretty cool. I made some good stuff there. So some people from Black Magic that I know ran into Chadwick there. That was nice. Love to catch up with him when I can. Although we don't really get to do that often. But I do catch him at some shows and things like this at the Javits Center there. But worked out really well. I thought it was good. Not too much stuff. Most of it is broadcast stuff so it doesn't really apply to me. But always fun to look at it nonetheless and just kind of see what's out there. What's available and what kind of freebies they got. So it's cool stuff that you get out there. So met up with some people at Black Magic. That's always fun. I enjoy meeting with them and chatting with them and telling them what I like about all the new Black Magic stuff and whatnot. So overall I think it was a good trip. I did get to my modern bread and bagel. The best. The best. Gluten free. Everything that I've ever found anywhere. I mean they're amazing. There's a couple locations in Manhattan that I always stop at depending on where I'm at. So I made the trip down there and I should have threw in a little video of it. But I'll throw it a website down there. You can check it out because you can order online too. And I think they'll send it to you. Actually pretty cool. But amazing, amazing bagels. It's the best. So with that said I'm driving back home here back to Jersey, back across the river. And yeah that's about it for this one. So I'll see you guys in the next video. Peace.
