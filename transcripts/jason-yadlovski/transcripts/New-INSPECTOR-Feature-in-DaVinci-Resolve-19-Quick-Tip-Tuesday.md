## Transcript
If your video clips have multiple sources of audio built within that clip, you're gonna want to check this out, jump into resolve. I gotta show you something. Sometimes when I'm filming a video and I've got multiple people in the video, I'll put a lav mic on each person and then I have that audio go into my camera so that one person is recorded on the left channel, one person is recorded on the right channel. And in resolve, we can select which channel we want to use for a given piece of audio. So in this case, I have an audio clip right here. Now I'm not showing my video clips because it's got some of the kids in there, so we don't want to show that. But I got my audio clip selected and if we come to our inspector and then we come over to the file section. Not all about you guys, but I don't really use the file section here, but you might want to start using it because when I click on it, if I come down to the bottom here, we have audio configuration and now I can see the different audio tracks for my particular clip. Now let's say I'm looking in my media pool at a clip. For example, if I just come and open up this guy right here, when I have it selected into my media pool and I've got my inspector open and I'm in the file tab, I can see and preview the different audio tracks that are part of this file. So now down here, I have a right and left channel, which we're both recorded separately. So if I go in here and just put the little playhead right there and I just hit play. Is that my bubblegum? So there's one person. Now if I go to the track number two, the other channel. Now you hear the other person and I've also got one where it's got them combined where they would all be in the same track. Now most of the time when I record separately like this, I'm going to want one person in one track and one person in another track. But being able to take a look in the inspector here gives me a quick way to see how many audio tracks are associated with that video clip. Do I have more than one? Do I just have one? Because you may have a whole bunch of them. So this gives you an option to preview them, see which ones you want to use. And then when you bring your clip in your timeline, you can make sure you've got your correct audio source selected. And you've also got the option here to change the format so you can use your stereo. You can do mono, you can do adaptive, or you can do a custom where it'll open up our window here in the clip attributes. Click your drop down here and you can choose whichever one you want or set it up however you might want to do that. So this new little tip here is really handy when it comes to working with multiple audio tracks in a given video clip. I did that on a recent project I was on. I had two cameras, but I had four tracks of audio between the two cameras. So being able to preview it like this just makes it handy in helping you sort out where different things are, getting a quick preview instead of having to dump things in your timeline and then figure it out from there. So another cool little feature here when it comes to audio that was added in DaVinci Resolve 19 beta. It's right here in the edit tab. That wraps up this quick tip Tuesday guys and as always if you want to take your audio to the next level, learn the ins and outs of how to work with your audio. Check out my audio course, Audio Essentials for Video Editors in DaVinci Resolve. I'll link it down below. If you're interested, check it out. Alright guys, with that said, I will see you in the next video. Peace.
