## Transcript
What is going on guys, welcome back to the DaVinci Resolve podcast here where I answer your questions about DaVinci Resolve through comments that you leave on my YouTube channel because sometimes we just need a little more time to kind of dive into some of these questions. Some of them are quick and easy and it's easy to reply on YouTube but some of them require a little bit more in depth or I could just expand upon an easy quick comment I might leave back to you on YouTube. So it's just another way for you guys to kind of connect with me a way that we can jump in and talk about DaVinci Resolve. You can watch this podcast, you can listen to it, maybe on your drive to work, whatever, maybe on a run or something, I don't know. But really just a way to kind of connect with you guys and just get more information out there about DaVinci Resolve because we all have questions, we run into problems and issues so I just share some of my thoughts on your questions as well as anything else related to DaVinci Resolve or maybe even anything else sometimes. So let's just get right into it here. I've got a bunch of comments here to go through on the channel. I haven't had a chance to jump into the comment section lately and really kind of take a look at the things you guys are asking about and the reason for that is because I've been outside building a deck, been working on that and tearing down the old deck, putting up the new deck and it's been a lot of work, like a lot of hard work, getting older man. It takes me a little longer to do this stuff. But now back in the studio, we got a rain day here today so great day to go through your comments and work with the or make the DaVinci Resolve podcast here. So let's just jump right in. We're going to start right at the top here. The first comment is on a video I made about the new AI Music Editor and it's like the remix tool in Adobe if you're familiar with that says the comment is the AI tools are great out for me. They are there but unusable. I have version 20 on a Mac. I even tried reinstalling and uninstalling Resolve since some people online suggested that but I still can't get the features to work. So frustrating that this is a key feature I was looking forward to any suggestions. So one reason I had shot in the dark here might be that you downloaded the free version on accident instead of the studio version because you're going to see everything in the free version. You're just not going to be able to use it or it's going to come across watermarked or something like that if it's an effect. So double check that you have downloaded the studio version and not the free version. Okay. Because this is only in the studio version. I'm pretty positive on that. So double check that you didn't accidentally download the free version and if you did get studio and then you should be good to go. Otherwise there's no reason it should be great out. Haha. Just got a text from my daughter. She did Steel Force at Dornie Park. If you've ever been there they're on a class trip out there. I've been trying to get her to the big coasters for a while. I'm like it's not that bad. I'm like you got this. You got this. You did everything down Disney coast a little bit bigger, bigger drop. But you got to get in there and do that. So she did it and loved it. Who doesn't love coasters? Come on. Getting into the next comment here on 10 effects I use in every project in DaVinci Resolve. There was a super thanks here of $15. It looks like thank you so much there. Sight specialist LLC. And he says Jason your videos get better and better. I find myself watching them regularly. I appreciate that you really try to make sure that we learn what you're teaching. Not just demonstrating a new feature, but you're making sure we understand how to invoke it and benefit from it. Yeah. I mean, I do my best to just kind of show you more than just like, oh, here's the buttons. You click and turn it on and turn it off. You know, like how would you actually use this? Why would you use it? Is it the best thing that you should use in a given situation? I try to think through that just to give you guys a little bit more perspective on what the various tools are and why you may or may not use them. Right. Because maybe you don't need them. But thank you so much for your super thanks. Really appreciate your support of the channel here and all the work that I do for you guys. So thank you so much. Appreciate their site specialist LLC. Next comment we have here was on a video discover the incredible outside node in the color page. So this was in DaVinci Resolve 19, but it's still there. It's, you know, it's it's there. We're in version 20. It's still there, but they just said good tip. Thanks. So the incredible outside node. So the outside node, if you're not familiar with it, allows you to make a selection and select the outside of your selection. So that comes in really handy, depending on what you're trying to do, you know, in your color page with your masking and stuff like that. You might need the outside node. The next comment here is on my most viewed video, which is getting close to a million views. And believe it or not, has nothing to do with DaVinci Resolve. It actually is about the Blue Yeti microphone. And they just said had to throw together an interview online on very short notice. Thanks for making this video. It allowed me to get my Yeti dialed in with OBS studio. Yeah, no problem. I mean, I'm happy to like share settings like on different microphones that I've got. I've got so many different wireless microphones and then microphones like this guy and then the other one I normally use, which is actually it's right up here. You know, it just lots of lots of different microphones and stuff. But if you don't get that set up right and you don't get your recording good, it's hard to like make it better in post. You want to try and get it as good as you can when you're recording. So keep that in mind. Make sure you get your microphone set up good and get a good recording from the start. So when you get into post, makes your job a little bit easier. Next comment here on how I get perfect audio and DaVinci Resolve 19. And this would be the same for 19, 18, 17, 16, 20. Doesn't matter. The audio editing process is going to be the same process. And you're going to use the same basic tools to work with your audio. But they said, thank you, you helped me so much. It's been difficult finding a sound engineering video that I understand. You clearly describe what all the settings do and why we want to use them to make our audio sound better. Fantastic tutorial. Yeah, you're welcome. I'm glad I'm able to kind of just break things down and make it simple. Like this program is so complicated anyway. Like let's make it simple, right? Show me the easiest way to understand things and show me what they do, right? And why I'd want to use them. So even with all these new AI tools, you still need to know or I think you should know how to edit your audio, at least the basics of it, right? Because you're going to need to get in there, make some adjustments. You're probably not going to go with just whatever the AI does, right? With any of these AI tools, because it's really just a starting point, in my opinion. You want to know what you're doing, why you're doing it, and be able to make the creative decisions on your own. So keep that in mind. Next comment here on my 10 free effects I use in every project. I personally use DaVinci Resolve, but I make edits that use invert flashes, image flips, lighting, explosions, velocity, panning, DaVinci. That's a lot there. It has almost all, but there are some effects I can't find when I look for those kind of effects. I wish there were a lot more effects like these, but otherwise amazing software. So when it comes to all those kinds of effects, you're not going to find them in just the effects library. You're probably going to jump into fusion and that's where you're going to find all that stuff. And I'm pretty sure now I'm not a fusion expert by any stretch, but you know, who is my buddy Casey Ferris? Guy knows fusion inside. Now he's my go to guy for anything fusion. Patrick Sturring knows fusion really well too. So you could drop a comment on one of those guys channels or something. And I'm sure everything that you're asking about, you can probably do. It's just, do you know where to find it? Okay. So I would, I would just double check, maybe send them a note and see what you could figure out. But I'm pretty sure all that stuff is in there. You just got to know where to find it. All right. You ever run into a problem here where like your files are linked, right? Your audio and your video files are linked and then they're not linked and you don't know what to do. So it's really easy. There's a couple of different ways to double check that. You can select both of them, right click, choose a link clips down at the bottom to either link or unlink them. And then there's also the little link icon that's up in the toolbar above the timeline. If your clips are already linked, but you only want to move one of them, you can turn that off. It'll allow you to grab just the audio or just the video, move that clip wherever you want. And then you can hit the link icon back on and those clips are still going to be linked together. So the comment here on this one is I must have hit a button by accident. This saved me. Thanks so much, man. Yeah. Sometimes you hit a keyboard shortcut and you're like, dude, what did I do? No idea. Or even you get a few commands down the road, you know, so you can't undo like control Z or command Z. And you're like, oh man, I don't know what I hit because there's short keyboard shortcuts all over the place. Happens to me all the time, you know. So, yeah, LinkedIn on new clips. If you're running that problem, I got a video on you on that for you. It's called linked files are not linked in DaVinci resolve quick tip Tuesday. Check it out. Next comment on the color grade match fast in DaVinci resolve. It's really a one click thing where you can match the shot or the color grade of one shot to the next. And the question was, can we use it in the free version? And yes, I believe it's in the free version. And if you don't have a middle mouse wheel, because all you have to do is select the clip that you want to apply the grade to go to the clip. You want to apply the grade from and middle mouse click. And that's going to apply the grade for you. And if you don't have a middle mouse wheel or whatever, then you can always right click on there and you can choose apply or append grade, depending on what you want to do. It's going to do the exact same thing. But I'm pretty sure that's also in the free version. So you should be able to match grades real quick, real real quick in one click as I trip over my own tongue. Next comment on DaVinci resolve for beginners is your keyframes and animations where I covered the entire new keyframe tab, gave you some tips and tricks along the way, showed you how to use it and all that kind of fun stuff. It's a great new tool. I think it did a good job with getting the keyframes, you know, in its own window and making it a little bit easier to work with and making it more familiar than or more familiar for some of you that may have worked in other programs and stuff. But they said comment here is a cool feature. My only complaint is that they launched it before it supported effect keyframes, but it's a very good start. And I find that that happens often. I think Blackmagic like will put something out, right, and let people start to use it as they continue to refine it. So you're probably going to get keyframes for your effects in here. I would pretty much guarantee it when I don't know. I would think it's in one of the updates from version 20 here that'll be, you know, coming out at some point in the future here. But they usually add in and elaborate on some of the new tools, but they want to get people using them. Get the feedback. Are there any issues? What do you like? What do you don't like? And then they're going to add in those extra things that we kind of want just to make the tool work a little bit better for us. So I think that over time, they're going to add that in the effects keyframes right in the keyframe panel where you can do it right there. So stay tuned. I mean, I have no insider info. I don't know. But I would just keep my eyes open and, you know, eventually I think that's going to be added in. Next comment here on that same keyframes video that we're talking about a moment ago. I love DaVinci, but I really hate to animate in DaVinci. As an animator, I never get the results I want, no matter how simple I want them. So I'm not sure why. I wonder, you know, what, why it's not working out for you. I'm sure there's specific examples that you've got. They didn't leave any, you know, specifics about why it's not working the way they want it to. I mean, keyframes are keyframes. As far as I understand them, I mean, they should work, you know, in any way that keyframes would in any other program. But I'm sure there's some specific reasons tied into animating as far as why it won't work. Now, I don't know what those are, so I don't do animations. Casey might actually have a good answer on that. I know he does a lot of animating or has done animating, making his own, you know, cartoons and stuff in Fusion. So he might have, you know, some better insight and knowledge on that. But yeah, I'm not sure exactly what you need, but maybe they'll add it in the future. Drop it in the forums, you know, and tell them what you're looking for. Maybe they'll add it in. Another comment here on how to edit to the beat in DaVinci Resolve 18. And actually the way that we did it in 18, right, by showing the transients and getting the beats, we've got another better way to do that in DaVinci Resolve 20. And that's to use the automatic or AI beat detector. I forget. I don't even know if that's exactly what it's called. But essentially, it finds the beats for you and allows you to edit the edit to them a whole lot easier and a whole lot quicker. But the comment was awesome tips. Thank you in the midst of dropping images into a DJ set. This will massively speed up the process. So I would check out the new way to do it in version 20. If you've got version 20, if you don't have version 20, then go with that method. And that'll work out just fine for you too. Next comment we have here is about the auto sync feature in PowerBins. And is it more power bins? It might be in your regular bins. I've said the comment is this. Anyone else find that this feature stopped working in version 19 and 20. And that's where, like, if you have, for example, a power bin folder, right? And you bring things from your hard drive into the power bin. The power bin can look at that file, file location on your hard drive and automatically update with any new files that you put in to that folder. So you don't have to constantly keep dragging them into PowerBins. Now, I haven't had much luck with it actually working. And I don't know why that is. I always end up dragging and dropping over my files still the same way I always used to do it because that auto sync thing, like it just, it doesn't work. I don't know. Or maybe, maybe it's just me. I don't know. But it doesn't seem to work for me either. So I don't know if that's a glitch or I'm not doing it right. But yeah, I've noticed that hasn't been working so great. So I'm with you on that one and not really sure the fix. Another comment on my most viewed video there coming up on a million views about the Blue Yeti. Thanks so much for these awesome tips. I've had a Yeti for years, but never use it enough to nail down what works best. So it takes a little trial and error to figure out what's going to work best for any given microphone. But like I said before, get that audio good from the start. So that way you don't got to worry about trying to make it good. In post, it'll already be good because you recorded it the best that you can. Next up, comment on my video about the DaVinci Resolve AI Audio Assistant. And the comment is, anyone having trouble with the export after the AI Audio Assistant? It takes forever. I haven't actually used the audio assistant and exported it out because I'm never happy with the results that it gives me. So I don't really use it. I tried it out a few times in that video. I gave my thoughts on it and whether I would or would not use it. And I'd say like 9.9 times out of 10. I'm not going to use it. Like it's just not going to do the job that I want it to do. Whether it's sound design or just even a basic YouTube video. Right. It's not going to do what I want it to do because it doesn't know what I'm thinking. Right. I mean, it's going to set some basic levels and basic things, but it doesn't know what I'm thinking and what I actually want. So that's the challenge. I think with some of the AI stuff is that it doesn't know what you want. It's just going to use some basic parameters to do things and it's going to leave it at that. Right. It doesn't dynamically change things. Like it has no way to know what you actually want and what you're thinking. So yeah, I haven't tried exporting it. So I believe that it probably would take more time because if you use other tools that are, you know, AI, voice isolation, any that kind of stuff, like it just is a little more intense, intensive of a process for your computer to do. So I imagine it's going to make it take longer to render too. So the next comment here is on how to save EQ presets for your audio. And they say, when I create an EQ preset in Fairlates, not available in the edit pages, track EQ presets. How can I export it to the edit page? In fact, how do I export these file setups to a file that I can move across PCs? So one thing individually solve and I just took a look at this. If I open up my mixer, you're going to have a little, uh, uh, and you're making sure you got your effects, your dynamics and your EQ and you could just double click on any one of those icons in the mixer. And it's going to open up that panel for you. And when I do that, I can actually get to all of my EQ presets. Now I can't get to a track level preset or, uh, you know, some of the other things that we can do in Fairlates, like the global presets, but you can get to your dynamics, your EQ and access the presets for those specific things. If I double click on my effects, I don't have any effects on the track currently that I'm looking at here. So that's not going to open, but you should be able to access all of your EQ presets right in the edit page. Once you open up the, the large EQ from the mixer. So if you're not seeing that, I'm not sure why you're not. You should. And they should all be there. So that's the answer to the first part of the question is that you can actually access them in the edit page. Now, how do you take those presets and bring them to like another computer? Maybe you've got DaVinci Resolve on another machine. So to do that, you have to find where they're saved. And I just looked that up the other day because I don't remember off the top of my head. It's a little confusing on where Resolve saves these things on a Mac and on a PC. And, uh, how do I find that? I have to go look it up. Let me see. I know I have it here because it's part of the instructions if you were to pick up my presets. So let me just navigate to where I have that. And I can tell you. So we have, let me see. You know, sometimes you get so many files going on here. It's kind of kind of hard to remember where you put everything, but I got it here. OK, so we have for our EQ presets. Let me jump into my page where it tells me where they're at. All right. So on Mac, if you're on a Mac, well, you said you're on a PC. So let me tell you the PC first. What I have for the PC is, I mean, this was a Windows 10 location. So if it's newer than that, you're going to have, you might have to tweak it a little bit. But if you look at your C drive users, then your username, app data, roaming, black magic design, DaVinci Resolve, preferences, fair light presets. And in there, you should find all of your preset files and then you can just copy them and then paste them into, you know, your new PC in the same directory there. Copy and put them over there and you should be good to go. And for those of you who are on a Mac, if you're on a Mac, it's a little bit different. It's Macintosh HD users, your username, library, preferences, black magic design, DaVinci Resolve, fair light presets EQ. Now, that might be a little bit, you might notice you can't find it on a Mac because there's several directories that look almost identical. And anytime somebody can't find where to put the presets or where to grab your your presets and stuff, it's usually because you're in the wrong path. And there's a couple that look very, very similar and it's really hard to tell the difference. So yeah, you just want to be be be aware of that. But yeah, you should be able to grab them from, you know, those locations Mac PC, copy it to a new computer, put it in the same location, restart, resolve, boom, they should be there. You should be good to go. Next comment on the keyframes video here. When will they add this on iPad i version 20, but it doesn't work. I have no idea. I haven't been keeping up with what's going on on the iPad because I would never edit on the iPad. My iPad's so old that it wouldn't even run to vent result anyway. So I don't even pay attention to what's going on in the iPad. Because for me, it just would never make sense to edit on an iPad. So I'm not really sure when that's going to be available on the iPad or if it even is. But just keep your eyes open. Make sure you update often. And when it's out there, I'm sure it'll pop up, you know, you'll see it and be able to work with it. But yeah, I really have no idea about any of the iPad stuff. So sorry, I can't help more on that one. Next comment on 10 free effects I use in every project of the venture is all I'm experiencing an issue with the venture resolve 20 studio where it only records background noise but completely fails to capture my voice despite all hardware and software settings appearing to be correct. So it sounds like there's something that's not correct. So it's just recording some static for some reason. So what I would do is I would start by checking all my connections on my microphone and my audio interface. If that's what you got or however your setup is, check all your cable connections, redo everything. I would then make a new project and then I would start trying to do a voiceover all over again. Now you could use the new voiceover setup. Makes it pretty easy just to, you know, get your microphone and start recording. Or if that doesn't work, maybe try the old school way, jump into Fairlight, patch things and just make sure that the correct microphone is being used as the input in the venture resolve. So that way you're actually getting a good recording because something is off somewhere, whether it's, you know, the hardware stuff or the software settings and DaVinci resolve. Something's obviously off because if it wasn't, you would be recording, right? So I would just kind of start fresh, starting a new project because sometimes projects get a little wonky too, where it just won't record or weird things happen. Make sure wherever that project is getting saved is, you know, a spot that you've got room on your hard drive, right? And in DaVinci resolve 20, you set up that location when you create the new project. So you want to make sure that you do that. So there's definitely something that's off somewhere and it sounds like it's maybe got the wrong input or something because by default, sometimes resolve picks the wrong input. So I would just double check all that stuff, try it again, new project and just see how that works out for you. All right, here's a great comment for you or question on how to get perfect audio in DaVinci resolve where I went through like the whole audio editing process and what you should do and why and all that kind of stuff. What tools to use the whole nine yards. So they say, Jason at minute two 14 for normalization, you selected sample peak program. If I'm making videos solely for YouTube, should I select the YouTube option to normalize or do you still recommend going with the sample peak program for YouTube videos? As always, thanks for your tutorials. You're making a difference to lots of us out here. So this is a great question because when you go to normalize an audio clip, which is basically set your levels, right? A good spot where you want it to be. You right click, choose normalization and you've got a whole bunch of different options in there. Now the YouTube option is going to set your levels so that they're pretty high. So if you were to watch your meter after you normalize using the YouTube preset, your levels are going to be pretty high. I think the max is like minus 2 dB or something. I have to double check it off. Actually, you know what? I have it right here. Let me just drop in a audio clip here. So if I right click and I go normalize audio levels and I choose a YouTube. So it's going to be a target level target level of a minus one and target loudness of minus 14. So the target level minus one is basically going to take your audio levels and bring them up until they're hitting like minus one dB on your meter. It's going to try and set the overall loudness for that particular clip to be or well, I guess you could suck multiple clips and do them relative to each other. But it's going to set the loudness to minus 14. Now, if you only have dialogue and that's it, you don't have anything else, you could probably use that setting. It would probably be all right. But I don't recommend that because if you set all of your clips to be like that, whether it's your music, your sound effects, your dialogue, all of them and use that YouTube preset. At the end, when they're all added together, they're going to be over that minus 14. Luffs, it's going to be too loud. It's going to be too much. YouTube is going to come in. They're going to squash it down on you. And you don't want that to happen. You want all of your audio settings and the way it sounds when it's done to be exactly what you want. You don't want any platform, whether it's YouTube or somebody else, coming by and being like, nah, nah, nah, it's too loud and pushing it down. You don't want that because it's not going to be the way you want it to sound. Right. So what I recommend is that if you were to come in and right click on a clip and choose normalize audio levels, is that you use the sample peak program. And that's the one that I like. And the target level on that is minus nine DB. So I recommend all the time forever that your dialogue levels should be about minus 10 DB in that ballpark. So if you use the peak program, sample peak program for normalizing, it's going to set them at a max of minus nine DB. So close enough, whatever, you know, it's good enough because you're never going to get exactly a 10 only. But I think that's a good starting point for your dialogue. You want it to be there. Now, if you have music, that might be a little too loud. Maybe it's not, depending on whether you have talking over the dialogue or not or talking over the music or not. Just depends on, you know, your section of the video there for sound effects might be OK. Might not be. Again, sound effects can have such a huge range of where you could set those levels, depending on what you want it to sound like. So that relies on your creativity. Like, do I want this thing loud or do I want it soft, depending on what it is? And by doing that and setting your levels not so high and so hot that, you know, at the end of the process, it's just too much for a platform like YouTube. By setting them like this, you're kind of doing what I think is right. And then at the end of the process, you can check your loudness and you can actually bring everything up as a whole. Instead of having everything start at the top and then trying to figure out, it's too loud. I got to bring it down. Well, you set everything balanced, you know, the way it should be. And then we can just grab everything and bring it up as a whole at the end to make sure that our loudness levels are up around that minus 14. Love. So without exceeding it. So that way you've got exactly what you want. Your mix is exactly what you want. Nothing's going to get compressed or squashed down by wherever you're uploading it to. And you should be good to go. So I don't recommend using the normalization preset for YouTube. Because I just think if you did that on too many clips, if it was more than just dialogue, it's going to be too hot. It's going to be too loud. And it's just it's not going to work out the way probably that you wanted to. So I recommend doing the sample peak program, get you in a good spot, and then you can be off and running and do the rest of your audio editing. So that's that's the way I think about it. Now, is it correct 100% correct? I don't know. But that's from all my learning and research. That's the way that I like to do it. I'm sure there's other people who've got other ways and that's OK, too. Well, you know, as long as you get the end result that you want, you know, really do do it anyway that you want. So yeah, that's that. And the last question or comment here that we're going to wrap it up on is on actually an old keyframes video. But the same question would apply to today. And they say, hello, Jason at this time, you said that you already deleted a keyframe, but you didn't mention how to delete it. Can you tell me how to delete a keyframe? So it's easy to delete a keyframe. You can just go into your keyframe editor. You can just click on the keyframe to select it. It should highlight. You can select multiple keyframes if you want. You can window over them. And then once they're selected, all you have to do is hit either your delete or backspace key and it's going to delete those keyframes. You're good to go. Now, if you want to reset all of the keyframes, you'll see that little circle reset button with the little arrow going backwards or whatever. If you want to get rid of all of them, you can go ahead and click on that and it'll just return everything to default settings. But if you just want to get rid of a few of them, then you could just select it, hit delete or backspace and you should be good to go to get rid of those keyframes for you. So that wraps up this episode of the DaVinci Resolve Podcast. I hope answering some of these questions is helpful to you guys. If you have specific questions, drop a comment somewhere. And if you want it specifically to be on the DaVinci Resolve Podcast, let me know. Say, hey, can you answer this on the podcast? And I'll respond to you on YouTube too. But, you know, I'll know, oh, let me put this in the bin for, you know, answering questions on the DaVinci Resolve Podcast. So lots of great stuff here in version 20 as we've talked about before and we'll continue to talk about. I've got lots more videos to make for you guys. And with that said, I got to get back to work here, making more videos and figuring out what you guys want to know. So with that said, I'm out of here. Thank you guys so much for tuning in. I will see you or hear you in the next video. I don't know. I'll catch you guys later. We'll see you. Peace.
