AirPod Pros sound pretty good, but as an audio guy here, I want them to sound even better and you do too. I'm going to show you how you can get the best sound quality out of these little AirPod Pros right now. First thing, pop in your AirPod Pros. Next you want to go ahead and grab your phone. You're going to go to Settings, then go down to Accessibility. Scroll down to Audio Visual right here. Next you want to jump in Headphone Accommodations. If it's turned off like this, go ahead and turn it on. And right down here you've got several different options for a balanced tone, vocal range, and brightness. Now these can change the way that it sounds. Balanced tone will give you a good low end as well as a decent high end, a little boost in there. Vocal range will boost up your mid tones a little bit. And brightness is going to make everything sound a little bit crisper there for your audio that you're listening to, whether it's music, podcasts, whatever it might be. You can also adjust this slight, moderate, and strong, which is going to boost the quieter things in your audio that you're listening to and just kind of make it a little bit louder. Now there's a sample here. You can hit Play Sample and then see what these different things sound like. Typically I like to go with slight and I like to stick with the balanced tone. And you could also go to Custom Audio Setup, go through the process there and set up your own custom settings. The second method here to make that audio sound even better, again grab your phone, go to Settings, scroll down to Apps at the bottom. If you use Apple Music, this is for you. Scroll down to Music, click on Music and you can come down here to the Audio section and click on the EQ and you can choose the EQ that works best for you or that you think sounds the best. For me personally, I like rock that's going to boost the low ends a little bit for you, the bass and low ends. It's going to increase the high end just a little bit and it's maybe cause a little drop in the mid range there. So that's the kind of sound that I like to go for, but try these out, see what you like, you can play through your music and these are going to make a difference in helping these guys sound better. Now if you are a Spotify person, I am, go ahead and jump into the Spotify app. Go to your Settings and Privacy, go to Playback and in the Playback here we also have several different things we can look at. Your volume level, you can do loud, normal or quiet, typically I leave mine on loud and then down here we've got the equalizer and in here you've got some preset EQs that you can pick from, again rock, you can see what it looks like there or you can come up here and just drag around your EQ however you want. Now if you want those good low end bass notes, you're going to want to boost the low end a little bit. If you want nice, crisp, clean highs, you're going to want to boost the top end a little bit. But I suggest you play something, go through these different settings and see what you like the best and then stick with those settings. And one more setting here to unlock the best quality sound from your AirPods Pro, jump into Settings, scroll down to Sounds and Haptics, come to Headphone Safety and under Headphone Safety here you're going to see Reduce Loud Audio. That might be turned on like this and you want to go ahead and turn that off so that way you've got a full range of volume that you can use for your AirPods Pros. If it's turned on, it's going to limit the volume for anything that you're listening to so you might find it's just a little quiet, it's not doing the job for you good enough, turn off Reduce Loud Audio and you should be able to get a full volume out of your headphones if you choose to do that. So that is four different ways you can take your AirPods Pros here and get better quality audio out of them. Now there are some other headphones that are better that I'll talk about in another video that I think I would use over these guys but if you've got AirPods Pros that's how you can get the best sound out of them. So if you have any questions, comments, perhaps a concern, leave it down below. If you want to learn how to edit your audio, I'm actually DaVinci Resolve Audio Guy. You can check out some of my videos on how to edit your own audio to make it sound the best you can. With that said, I will see you in the next video. Peace.
