Today we're gonna be doing a real world audio edit. So you guys from time to time send me files and ask for a little advice Or maybe what could I do better? And I've got a bunch of them and today we're gonna be taking a look at one particular clip from a channel named CJ Smalls had to take a look at it here. It is we'll throw it up on the screen here CJ had reached out to me a while back back in like September actually and just had some questions about his audio head said Hey, can you take a look and let me know what I could do to make it better? So I'm always happy to help you guys out. So we're gonna jump into resolve with a clip that he had sent me I'm looking at this essentially for the first time here And we're just gonna kind of go to work on it see what we can do see how we can make it sound a little bit better And hopefully some of these tips and tricks are gonna help you in your audio editing process So let's just jump right into resolve. All right, so jump it into resolve here. This is the file that I got from CJ Let's just take a little listen to a little bit of it here and see what we're working with So our front off is definitely splurged in free agency we have Devon single Terry Shaq Griffin Baker may be okay So not too bad for what am I gonna do first the first thing that I'm gonna do is check my level So I'm in the edit tab right here. We're gonna start here in the edit tab I'm gonna go ahead and open up my mixer and I'm just gonna watch my levels and kind of see where they're falling for this particular clip Now since it's dialogue, I kind of wanted to fall around that minus 10 DB right here So let's see where we're currently at field as our quarterback. Wow Adrienne Amos got another running back and Antonio Gibson Cam Jordan Taylor Luan a couple vets Michael Pierce Damien Lewis Donovan Peoples Jones Josh Allen. I mean, all right, so it looks pretty good there You notice we did have a pretty high peak right there. So levels are okay Let's leave them where they're at and just kind of see where we can go from here So I think what I'm gonna do is jump over into the fair light tab just so we have access to more audio tools So I'm gonna hit the musical notes at the bottom jump into fair light clean up my window a little bit here and The first thing I think I want to do is work with a little bit of EQ So we're currently on track number one in my mixer here If you don't have your mixer open you can click your mixer right here I'm gonna want to change this because I like to go EQ dynamics then effects So we're gonna change that to this guy right here. I'm gonna double click my EQ to open it up Put this on the side I'm gonna zoom out on my timeline a little bit here And I'm just gonna set this so that it'll loop over and over again So if I get to the end and I'm not done yet, it'll just replay for us So I'm gonna set some in and out points by hitting I in the beginning and it's automatically gonna set the end point for me There I'm gonna turn on my loop icon, which is this one right here And now I can just hit the space bar and when it gets to the end of the clip It's gonna loop back and play it again for me. So let's do a little EQ work here and see where it goes from here Okay, so our front off is definitely splurged in free agency. We have Devon single Terry Shaq Griffin Baker Mayfield as our quarterback. Wow Adrienne Amos got another running back and Antonio Gibson Cam Jordan Taylor Luan a couple vets Michael Pierce Damien Lewis Donovan Peoples Jones Josh Allen I mean the chief's front office really went all out. So this team is definitely gonna be much better Starting off in year two. Now. Let's hope we can do the same thing in the draft. Okay, so our front off is definitely Splurged in free agency. We have Devon single Terry Shaq Griffin Baker Mayfield as our quarterback Wow Adrienne Amos got another running back and Antonio Gibson Kim Jordan Taylor Luan a couple vets Michael Pierce Damien Lewis Donovan Peoples Jones Josh Allen I mean the chief's front office really went all out. So this team is definitely gonna be much better Starting off in year two. Now. Let's hope we can do the same thing in the draft. Okay, so our front off is definitely Splurged in free agency. We have Devon single Terry Shaq Griffin Baker Mayfield as our quarterback Wow Adrienne Amos got another running back and Antonio Gibson Cam Jordan Taylor Luan a couple vets. Alright, so I've worked with the EQ a little bit there Let's talk about what I did Hopefully you guys can hear the changes that I was making if you got some headphones It's gonna be a little bit easier to hear it First thing I did was throw on band one and apply a high-pass filter So we cut out a lot of the low-end frequencies because we just don't need those in our dialogue The next thing I did was grabbed point four and looked around that you know 800 to 1.5 K range Somewhere in there to kind of remove some of the boxiness sounding right? It just didn't sound so great You know when you boost it up and kind of slide your points around that helps you find areas of you know Things that don't sound good right if it sounds harsh to you while you're doing that with the point Then there's a good chance it could use a little cut in that area now I did the same thing around with point number three here around 363 Hertz because I found something that just it sounded a little again kind of boxy there Let's just play with this point three here. See if you can hear what it sounds like Michael Pierce Damien Lewis Donovan People's Jones Josh Allen. I mean the chief's front office really went all out So so you can hear that there I just it didn't sound good to me So I dropped it out a little bit and then on point number two here around 225 I just made a slight cut there now I did add a little boost with band number five here around you know between the four and eight K there just to help with a little bit Of clarity so I think this just helped clean it up a little bit Let's do a little quick before and after here and just listen to the difference. So we'll start with before I'll turn it on You can hear the after this team is definitely gonna be much better starting off in year two now Let's hope we can do the same thing in the draft. Okay, so our front office Definitely splurged in free agency. We have Devon single. All right, so I think it helped clean it up a little bit It did make it a little bit quieter So we want to check our levels again and kind of see where we're at and we're gonna move on to the dynamics We're gonna check our levels there and make any adjustments that we need to so I'm gonna go ahead and close our EQ And open up our dynamics. I'm gonna turn on my compressor because I'm gonna be Applying a little bit of compression especially for this bigger spike right over here We want to make sure that that's not peeking and not too loud So let's play through our clip and adjust our dynamics a little bit I think for my ratio on my compressor. I'm gonna start with 2.5 And we'll see where we need to put the threshold But let's just play through and see what we got. So Terry Shaq Griffin Baker Mayfield as our quarterback Wow, Adrienne Amos got another running back and Antonio Gibson Cam Jordan Taylor Luan a couple vets Michael Pierce Damien Lewis Donovan Peoples Jones Josh Allen I mean the chiefs front office really went all out. So this team. All right, so I think this is pretty good here Right, we have our threshold around minus 20 dB We've got a ratio of 2.5 to 1 and I boosted the makeup a little bit just to balance out the parts that are a little bit quieter and Not that they're even that quiet in in this particular clip I think it's a pretty good volume But we boosted it just a little bit and then you can see our compressor being applied because this column right here lights Up blue and when that lights up that means the compressors being applied now when we got to this little spike right here I noticed that we didn't peak you know, it came up It was in the red but it didn't peak all the way up to the top like it was before So just check this out when we hit the the spike right here check it out and watch our meter So we're gonna be compressing and then we can see what our output meter is telling us as far as what our levels are After the EQ and the dynamics have been applied and people's Jones Josh Allen I mean the chiefs front office really went all out. So this so I think that works out pretty good now I don't want to go below minus 6 dB for the game reduction or the compressor I kind of want to make sure it's like maybe that minus six at most, but I think that's pretty good so we're gonna leave that for that now and We'll move on to some effects So one of the effects that I like to apply here right in DaVinci Resolve is a multi-band compressor So to add a multi-band compressor, it's a built-in effect here. I'm gonna click on the plus We're gonna come down to dynamics fairlight effects and multi-band compressor So I'm just gonna start with everything in its default ranges here And I might just boost or lower some of these areas by using the gain knobs right here and we're gonna see how it sounds So let's play through our clip. I might start with the lower end here Just kind of bring back some body to the voice, but let's see what we got here Team is definitely gonna be much better starting off in year two now. Let's hope we can do the same thing in the draft Okay, so our front off is definitely splurged in free agency We have Devon single Terry, Shaq Griffin Baker Mayfield as our quarterback Wow, Adrienne Amos got another running back and Antonio Gibson, Cam Jordan, Taylor Luan, a couple vets Michael Pierce, Damian Lewis, Donovan Peoples Jones, Josh Allen I mean the Chief's front office really went all out So this team is definitely gonna be much better starting off in year two Now let's hope we can do the same thing in the draft. Okay, so our front off is definitely splurged in free agency We have Devon single Terry, Shaq Griffin Baker Mayfield as our quarterback Wow, Adrienne Amos got another running back and Antonio Gibson, Cam Jordan, Taylor Luan, a couple vets Michael Pierce, Damian Lewis, Donovan Peoples Jones, Josh Allen I mean the Chief's front office really went all out So this team is definitely gonna be much better starting off in year two now Let's hope we can do the same thing in the draft. Okay, so our front off is definitely splurged in free agency We have Devon single Terry, Shaq Griffin Baker Mayfield as our quarterback. Wow Adrienne Amos got another. All right, so I think that's pretty good I did adjust our frequency ranges a little bit I tried to bring in a little more body and warmth a little more low end to the to the dialogue there And made a slight adjustment in the mid range there and in the high range I boosted it just a little bit and I think it makes a decent difference there Now I did notice that I did lose some of my output signal right around my output levels So I just boosted the gain a little bit here in the effect itself So that way I can bring us back up to closer to that minus 10 dB So I'm gonna say I'm good with that. I'm happy with that I'm gonna go ahead and close that out for now Now another effect that I do like to add on is a de-esser just to help with some of those harsh s sounds again a built-in effect here in resolve I'm gonna click the plus We're gonna go down to restoration, fairlight effects and de-esser So for the de-esser here a lot of times I'm just gonna start with the preset here the male ESS I'm gonna play through it and a lot of times too I make it a little more narrow there I don't like it as big as the wide one there like that So I'm gonna make that a little bit narrower just play through it and see if we can hear a difference Running back in Antonio Gibson, Cam Jordan, Taylor Luan, a couple vets Michael Pierce, Damien Lewis, Donovan Peoples Jones, Josh Allen I mean the Chief's front office really went all out So this team is definitely gonna be much better starting off in year two Now let's hope we can do the same thing in the draft Okay so our front office definitely splurred So we can see it's doing quite a bit of work here because our reduction meter here is lighten up pretty good so I think it helps just kind of remove a little bit of the harshness of the s's there it's a lot of s's and it could be a factor of the environment that he's recording in the microphone that he's using it seems a little bit on the high end like with the s's and stuff a little a little much so I think this dials it back pretty nicely Those are the basic edits that I'm gonna do to a piece of audio like this Now let's jump back into the edit tab here I'm gonna just copy this down into another track so we can hear a little before and after so I'm just gonna use option or alt to select just the audio copy it down into a new track so we have our after audio in track one and we have our before audio in track two so let's hear the before and then we'll hear the after Okay so our front office definitely splurged in free agency we have Devin Singletary, Shat Griffin Baker Mayfield as our quarterback wow Adrienne Amos got another running back and Antonio Gibson, Cam Jordan, Taylor Luan a couple vets Michael Pierce, Damien Lewis, Donovan Peoples Jones So what did you guys think could you hear the difference there do you think it was an improvement now everybody's ears are going to be different and obviously audio editing like a lot of editing is subjective but I think there's some good principles we followed here and I think we ended up with a good result that was better than the audio that we started with to me it's a little bit easier to listen to it sounds better and overall I think it was a good improvement over what we started with so Chris I want to know what did you think drop a comment down below and all you guys out there drop a comment down below let me know what you think was it better was it not better what did you like what did you not like what else might you do to make this audio even better yet so big thank you to Chris for sending over this file so that we can check it out work together and work on some real world audio editing I'm going to be doing some more videos like this coming up here in the future I enjoy just taking some audio from you guys working with it working through it together and really just showing you guys how I think about things the first time I hear the audio without like practicing it I don't practice this stuff I'm just going to jump on here film the video so you guys can see and hear my thought process and how we can make the audio sound better and if you are interested I have a full complete course audio essentials for video editors in DaVinci Resolve if you want to check that out learn everything you need to know about audio editing and how to take your videos to the next level when it comes to audio link down description below check that out if you're interested and with that said guys this real world audio edit is done and I will see you in the next video peace
