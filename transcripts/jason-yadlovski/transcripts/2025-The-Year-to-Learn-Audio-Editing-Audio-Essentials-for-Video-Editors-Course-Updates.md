Audio is super important when it comes to your videos. Whether it's YouTube, a film, doesn't matter, the audio is super important. My name's Jason Yolofsky, and if you don't know who I am, I make videos here on YouTube teaching you how to use DaVinci Resolve. And I do have a little niche in the audio area because I love me some good audio, and you guys should too. Now, even if you know who I am, you may not know that I have an audio course to help you guys take your audio from zero to being awesome. I put out my course in 2024, and I teach you all the basics of audio, the what to do, the why to do it, the how to do it, what different things mean when it comes to EQ, effects, dynamics, levels, all that kind of stuff. We cover it from end to end in one spot so that way you guys can learn and follow along on how to get your audio sounding awesome. And we work through a little mini documentary that I put together to take a look at all these different skills that we put together and be able to start with our audio raw out of camera, all the way up to finishing and finalizing our videos. So recently I added in a few new lessons to the course. So if you already picked up the course, you're gonna have access to those, you can check them out. And if you haven't picked up the course yet, they're included in the course now. It's an additional couple sections that cover some of the cool tools and new things we have here in DaVinci Resolve 19. So how do you find my course? Well, I'll leave a link down below, but if you take a look, you can head on over to dvresolve.com. And in order to find my course, it's right over here on the right hand side, where you can click on courses and audio essentials. So this is the audio course here, it's $79. And I tried to pack in as much value as I could for you guys. We cover all of the audio stuff from beginning to end, how to make your audio sound, the best that you can. I've given you practice media files, I've given you 40 presets. You'll have lifetime access to this course. There's over four hours of video. And if you wanna see what's in each one, you can take a look at the landing page here. But there's seven parts of the course down here. And the new part that I added in is part seven here. And if you click the plus, I talked about intro to the new updates here and DaVinci Resolve 19, as well as the duck or the music remixer, track control, and some more new features. And I'm gonna continue to add to this course over time because there's just always so much good stuff coming in. And I want you guys to have a one-stop shop to go and find this information. Now I do have YouTube videos on all this stuff, but you gotta kinda hunt around and find this stuff. So if you want one-stop shop, check it out. I think it'll just make it easier for you to go from start to finish with all of your audio stuff in this course. So if you have any questions about my course, feel free to drop a comment down below. If you do pick up the course and you run into issues, you can always reach out to me, send me an email, and I'm more than happy to help you figure out whatever kind of problems you might be having. Now you don't need studio for this course. You can use the free version and you're gonna be able to do everything that's in the course here. But I do go over some of the studio features and show how it helps make your process a little bit easier. And there's some tools in the studio feature that really just do the best job that I've seen for some of the things we might need to take care of, like background noise. But if you have the free version, totally fine. It's not a problem. So if you wanna level up your audio here in 2025, check out my course if it's something that you're interested in, if not, that's perfectly okay too. But I just want you guys to know that it's out there. And if you're looking for a one-stop shop for all of your audio stuff to learn the process, the reasons why we do what we do, and how to do it, maybe check it out and see if it's something that'll work for you. With that said, I'm off to make you guys some more YouTube videos, gonna keep the free content coming here. And if you have any questions, comments, perhaps concern, feel free to leave it down below. All right guys, happy 2025. I will see you in the next video. Peace.
