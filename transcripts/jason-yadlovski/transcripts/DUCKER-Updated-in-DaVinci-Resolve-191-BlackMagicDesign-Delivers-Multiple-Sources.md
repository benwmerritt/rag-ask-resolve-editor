## Transcript
The ducker has been updated in DaVinci Resolve 19.1. Black magic delivered exactly what we wanted and that is to be able to use multiple sources for our track to duck underneath. Here's how it works, check it out. For example, in this project here I've got three different dialogue tracks on tracks one, two and three and I want my music track right here to respond to the dialogue. I want it to duck underneath. So if I select my music track right here, I open my inspector, we can turn on our ducker and now under our source channels right here we can select multiple channels. So I'm going to select my three dialogue tracks by first selecting my first one, going to add two more there and then I can also select my other two dialogue channels as a source channel, adjust my duck level and you are good to go. So there you go, you can now use multiple tracks as the source for something like your music to duck underneath. That way you don't have to try and figure out other ways around it, use the side chain or do anything like that. Black magic has delivered exactly what we wanted and that is multiple sources to be able to be used as the input for our ducking. So real quick and easy today guys, if you have any questions on the new ducker, feel free to drop a comment down below and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Alright, we will see you in the next video. Peace.
