What's happening guys welcome to today's tip. This is an exciting video. Why? One because I'm using the C100 mark 2 over there first video with it How's it looking so far? Hopefully it's looking all right But the other reason why I'm excited is because we've got a cool Effect that we're gonna be going over here and that is the color generator now Have you used this before if not? It's pretty easy. It helps you change the color of stuff. So check it out Maybe you've got a cool energy effect kind of like this guy right here Comes in that color, but what if you want to change the color to be something like this? Or maybe you've got a little basic arrow coming on through and you don't want it to be white there You want to change the color kind of like this well It's easy to do using the color generator or if you've got more fancy looking arrows that kind of look like this That's the regular color and then boom throw on the color generator and then they look like this You can make them any color that you want it even works with cool hand-drawn graphics kind of like these guys Change the color boom drop on the color generator and it looks like this or last example here before we jump into it Wacky inflatable guy check that out right he's yellow orange whatever color he is there throw on the color generator We can make him any color that we want. Alright, so we're in DaVinci resolve here Let's take a look at the first example here the vfx energy element and if we look at the screen here We got the little flow a little wispy things flying on to the screen and they came in a bluish kind of color So let's say I want to change the color. I don't like that color. What do I do? Well, you want to open up your effects library up backing up a little bit I'm in the edit tab right here do all my work in the edit tab Don't worry about the cut tab jump into the edit tab So you want to open the effects library right here at the top you want to come down to your open effects and filters Click on that and we want to scroll down until we get to resolve FX generate and inside here. We're gonna see the color generator So you have news click on it drag it and drop it onto your clip now You notice in this example everything kind of turns white gets a little blown out So let's adjust the effect a little bit here select your effect come on into the effects now in the color generator here I can select whatever color I want. Let's say I want to go with green because that's easy now It does look pretty cool But it looks like it's maybe a little blown out there with the colors It ain't that bad yo, but if you wanted to kind of blend it in a little bit more Come on over to your inspector and actually if you didn't have your inspector open right there There you go inspector open up your global blend and here you can adjust The amount of color that's getting thrown in there right so you can see we can actually just fade it in and we can get a you know a Super bright green or we can go like around 50% get to with that little mint green looking little mint green So when we play through then we got it and it looks green. It's pretty cool So you could adjust it however you want and you've got lots of options on The colors that you can use right you throw the green on there And you've got a whole range of shades that you can use by using that global blend now One thing that would be helpful is that you want to make sure that your clips here do have a transparent background now If they don't if they have either a black background or a white background You can change the blend mode of it and that's gonna get rid of the background for you But then sometimes you know the effects a little wonky so if you have a transparent background That's gonna be your best bet for getting this effect to work taking another look at this example right here with the arrow So here is our basic arrow right flying across the screen and hitting the other side there Let's say same thing gonna grab my color generator drop it on there And then I'm gonna select my clip make sure I've got the inspector open come to my effects And we're gonna change the color. I want you tube red boom so something like this where it's a solid object No problem I really don't need to mess with the blend although you can if you want a special color or something That's not quite as saturated as the red and that's it boom there you go I mean it's just that easy to change the color of some of these effects here and even any of these fancier arrows that you see here It's gonna be the same thing right we're gonna want to select our Our arrow our clip drag and drop on the color generator and by default the color generator is white So you can see in this case the one arrow is now white and you can leave it white if you want that's fine You can throw a little drop shadow on there if you want that could that could work It could look kind of cool or you can again just go into your effects and change it to any color that you want I'm gonna say yellow boom there you go and in this case, you know It works out pretty good to just use the full effect on there I could drop back the blend a little bit if I wanted to make a little orangey whatever It just depends on exactly what you're looking for now real quick before I show you these last few effects I just wanted to mention motion array all of these overlays that you see in this video I got from motion array and man I got to tell you they have some awesome stuff there the overlays that they got and I've used them in a lot of my videos from little Explosions like this for you know people winning things to the arrows that you've seen here to the little floaty guy You're gonna see at the end of the video here They all come from motion array Literally I go on motion array all the time and I just kind of browse around because there's so much good stuff on there that like I just look around and it just gives me ideas of videos I can make or ways that I can use different assets in my videos But not only that they have awesome templates that you can use right here in DaVinci Resolve as well as other video editors If you use some other programs download the templates you pop in your footage You can get awesome intros you can get outros you can get all kinds of great stuff. They've got titles They've got social media little things that fly on the screen I mean pretty much any kind of asset that you might be looking for you can go to motion array and get it and The biggest reason I think that you want to use a service like this is just to save you time I mean sure you can learn how to create all these things on your own but that takes a lot of time and You want to get there and you want to crank out your videos right whether it's for clients whether it's for YouTube You want to be able to get through those projects quickly so you can move on to the next one So you can get to the next client so you can get to your next YouTube video and using a service like motion array That has so many awesome assets Just helps you speed up your process and just really helps bring your videos to the next level without you having to do as much work As if you had to go ahead and create it all yourself highly highly recommend motion array check them out There's so much good stuff there. I love them Thank you so much motion array for sponsoring today's video and with that said Let's jump back and check out these last two examples here with some cool hand-drawn effects that we can use here in resolve As well as a cool floaty guy that just saw in the beginning there. Let's check it out All right, check this out hand-drawn effects. We got an exclamation point and eyeball and Another eyeball because if you reverse it makes the eyeball longer and does the same thing just in reverse good idea, right? So let's drop one our color generator. I'm just gonna drop it on all three of these guys real quick so easy So let's say I want to change the color of my effect here. You can even pick different colors here I mean, I'm on a Mac if you're on a PC. I'm sure it's similar you get a color wheel or something pick whatever color you want I'm gonna go orange here boom. There you go. It's just that easy now the eyeball I've dropped two on there Let's say we want that one eyeball to be one color and another eyeball to be a different color So let's go with green and on this other guy. I'm gonna go with purple. So when we play through it, here's what we get Pretty cool, right? I mean eyeball changes color there. It's a cool drawing. I mean it's cool. I like that stuff I think it's cool. You guys think it's cool. What and the last one we have this floaty inflatable guy tube guy here Come on. We've all seen these on the side of the road, right little sale going on or something They got the inflatable guy, right? So this one came in orange. I downloaded it right from motion array But let's say I want to change the color of it. I'm gonna select my clip here drop on the color generator Now one thing to notice you can see here that it made it all white, right? Almost like an alpha channel kind of thing So in this case and this is gonna be true for some of the clips depending on which ones you're using and what the background looks like And stuff like that. I'm gonna come into my effect and I'm gonna pick a color here I don't know. Let's just go with cyan there in this case I'm gonna want to use the global blend and I'm gonna just back it down here and You know, I mean you can still see the other color coming through a little bit So you might need to play with it a little bit, but it kind of depends on the clip You know, you can still see it there kind of just shades it puts a fade on it, which is okay in this case I mean, I'm okay with that, you know, you may need to play with it a little bit depending on your clip and What the asset is that you're trying to change the color of I mean, maybe even want just the outline of it Maybe that's okay, too Or maybe you just want to change the color a little bit You can just drop that blend mode way down and or drop the blend not the blend mode But drop the blend down and then that's gonna, you know, just give a little different color on there for you All right guys that wraps up this video here the color generator. It's a sweet tool It's great to have that in your tool belt to just help change the color of stuff quickly. I use it all the time It's great and I love it.

So I am done here guys. Tell me how did the video look this time this whole video I filmed with the C100 mark 2 and usually I use my 5d mark 4 so I'm kind of curious how well does this work? Really, I mean, I'm curious to get in there and start editing this because this camera is awesome I mean, yeah, it's a few years old, but it's got a 4k sensor down sampled to 1080 Super excited about working with it here and I've already got the Canon L glass to throw on there So we've got good glass and glass is big part of the battle there, right? Gotta have the good glass to put on your good camera so you get some good video. Anyways with that said I'm getting this into the computer I'm gonna edit this up in DaVinci Resolve so I could check it out. Alright guys, thanks so much for watching And I look forward to seeing you guys in the next one. Peace You
