I edit your audio. Welcome back to another video in the series. I know it's been a little while It's actually it's been a long while and I thought it'd be time that we get another video in the series going if you're not familiar With it This is where you guys send in your audio files or your video with audio and then I show you how I would edit those audio files To make them sound the best that we can today We're gonna be taking a look at a small clip from a viewer Whose name is Karsten and he runs a company called mind space X where they do different kinds of training I believe it's for pilots so I'll link up his stuff below you can check that out But here is what the raw audio the raw clip sounds like that he had sent me then we're gonna be taking a look at when it comes to the All Indian operative to Indian operating distances they remain unchanged from dry runway You may think right now Well, if I have a wet or contaminated runway where I have snow or slush and surely that's gonna change the distances or take off Not exactly What changes is the amount of weight you can take off with Given those contaminated conditions. So that's the raw audio now Here's what it would sound like if I went through and did my typical audio process and Worked on this clip a little bit. Here's what it's gonna sound like by the time we get done with this video When it comes to the all Indian operative to Indian operated distances they remain unchanged from dry runway You may think right now Well, if I have a wet or contaminated runway where I have snow or slush and surely that's gonna change the distances or take off not exactly What changes is the amount of weight you can take off with Given those contaminated conditions. Let's jump into the venture resolve and we're gonna show you exactly Step-by-step the things that I did to this clip to make it sound better and more professional So as we jump into resolve here We have two clips here that he sent me to take a look at the first one is just the raw audio That you heard in the beginning of the video there but we also have another clip where he tried to apply some EQ to it and We're gonna take a listen to that and then we can see how that did but we'll be editing the raw audio clip Just to see what we can do with it now I am is starting off in the edit tab here since there is video associated with this clip Starting off in the edit tab down here But then we're gonna be jumping into fairlight where we've got more access to all the tools so before we get started I do have some studio monitors set up here You might have seen in the first shot, but when I'm editing audio and I really want to hear stuff I like to use a good pair of headphones. These are Sony MDR v6's. They don't make these anymore He's like 20 years old and these things are awesome. They still kick butt, but they make I think 7506 or something MDR 7506 I don't know but the point is have some decent headphones or some good speakers to listen to your audio on because if you're using junky laptop speakers It's gonna be hard to work with that audio not saying it can't be done, but it's gonna be easier if you got some good headphones So I'm gonna go ahead and throw these guys on and let's jump in a resolve and take a listen at the raw audio here in this first clip And see what we notice right off the back when it comes to the all-indian operative to engine Operative distances they've been made Okay, so right off the bat I notice I hear kind of some background noise a little hissing popping kind of thing going on there I noticed some harsh s sounds So we want to try and take care of that and I think it could probably just use a little overall eq to help clean things up a little bit Now just a quick word about the equipment that he's using here. He said that he's actually using some Decent equipment here. He's using a Sennheiser MKE 600 microphone Which is actually the microphone that I used to record 95% of all my videos I have it right down here off-frame you can't see it But that's what I use for most of my videos. So I know the microphone is top-notch It's a great quality microphone and he should be getting some good audio out of it So this Sennheiser microphone is a XLR microphone You do need to have an audio interface or have it plugged into some kind of interface to get it into your computer So I'm not so sure of his whole setup there But if it's you know decent equipment like he said you should be able to get a great recording out of it So let's take a quick listen at the clip where he adjusted the eq a little bit Tell me what you think about that comment below and I'm gonna let you know my thoughts in a second here Let's listen in when it comes to the all-Indian operative to Indian operating distances Okay now comparing the two back-to-back amount of weight you can take off with Given those can take off with Given those content so it sounds like the bass was boosted up a little bit It almost honestly sounds a little bit muddier to me It's a little bit harder to understand it's not quite as crisp and as clear Using whatever the EQ was that he applied there. All right, let's get to work here on this clip The first thing that I want to do we can do in the edit tab here or you can do it in Fairlight I want to adjust my levels So I'm gonna go ahead and open up my mixer right here Because I want to be able to see my meters and make sure that I'm getting some good levels for my audio clip here Just my screen just a little bit here make my meter a little bigger So we're just gonna be using this first clip with the roll audio. Let's watch our meter here and see where the levels fall When it comes to the all Indian operative to Indian All right, so it looks like we're coming in like minus 15 my 16 minus 17 Db there I want that to be closer to minus 10 db So I'm gonna just grab it right here and I'm just gonna boost up that volume While I watch that meter and I play back my clip here So I can kind of get it a little bit closer to right here that minus 10 db So let's go ahead and do that all Indian operative to Indian operated distances They remain unchanged from dry runway. You may think right now Well, if I have a wet okay, okay, I think that's pretty good now again I might you know go a little more in detail with it But for now, this is kind of how we're gonna approach this. I think this is pretty good I know some you might say hey did go into the red with the meters a little bit can't do that It's alright. Don't worry about it. We're gonna apply a little bit of compression that'll help that But it's actually alright if it goes into the red a little bit. It doesn't mean you're peaking It's only once you get above that zero db that you're actually peaking so keep that in mind So now that we've got some decent level set here We're gonna jump over into fair light so then we can continue to work with our audio jump it in the fair light The musical notes down here at the bottom. I go ahead and make my track a little bit bigger here I'm just gonna mute the track that I'm not using and now the process that I like to use to edit audio is first I want to set my levels I want to make sure I got good levels coming in that I've got a good signal to work with and really it starts with your recording So you want to do the best you can getting good levels recording, but once we get in resolve set our levels Let's get some good levels number two Number two number two number two I want to work with some EQ because I like to route my audio with good levels into the EQ first And then we're gonna follow up third by going into the dynamics where we can apply a little compression And get rid of a little bit of that background noise and then we go into our effects and we apply effects to our good clean Processed audio so starting out with our EQ what I like to do is loop of my clip So it'll just keep playing back over and over again So that I can adjust the EQ and not have to start and stop and start and stop in order to do that I want to select this guy right here, which is my range selection mode We're gonna go ahead and select my clip and then I'm gonna come up here and in my toolbar I'm gonna turn on the loop so that we have our range selected We want this to loop back and forth and just continuously play so we can adjust our EQ in order to do that You want to use option forward slash or alt forward slash on a PC? And then that's gonna loop the range that we just selected So I'm gonna go ahead and do that and then I'm gonna start working with the EQ here and see what we can find So to find the EQ you want to make sure you've got your mixer open and you should see it right here EQ to open the EQ all the way you're just gonna double click on it now If you don't see the EQ for some reason you could try coming to these three dots right here and then make sure that EQ is turned on right down here And if you still can't see use your middle mouse wheel to kind of scroll up and down here and you should be able to find it So let's go ahead and open up our EQ and we're gonna loop the playback here for this clip using Option forward slash for me maybe all forward slash for you and let's play with the EQ a little bit So the first thing I'm gonna do with the EQ is apply a high-pass filter Which means I'm gonna take out any of the low-end muddy frequencies So in order to do that I can actually do before even start playing I'm gonna set my band one around 120 Hertz here the next thing I'd like to do that we can also do before we even start listening to the clip here is turn on band 6 And we want to add a low-pass filter So this is just gonna cut out a lot of the high-end Frequencies maybe some hissing some noise that we don't want just gonna cut that out because for dialogue We don't really need that so let's go ahead. I'm turn that on and I'm just gonna roll it back a little bit We'll put around 16k close enough good enough. So let's go ahead and start our playback I'm gonna use option forward slash all forward slash for you Maybe if you're on a PC and I'm gonna grab my point number four and I'm gonna boost it up and you can use your middle mouse wheel to change the Q factor which is how far wide open or how close you know the the point is here Which means it's gonna affect more frequencies if it's wide it's gonna affect less frequencies if it's narrow So I'm gonna make it pretty narrow I'm gonna just gonna boost it up and I'm gonna sweep back and forth and I'm gonna listen for harsh Frequencies so harsh is anything that doesn't sound good. It could sound nasally could sound Distorted you're gonna see when we hit those spots. You'll hear it right away So I know that four vocals generally between the 1,000 and 2,000 range you're gonna have probably two points somewhere a little below 1,000 and somewhere around two That we're gonna want to drop out a little EQ most microphones can use a little EQ drop in that that area Just to help clean up the vocal a little bit So let's go ahead play through listening and see what we can do here when it comes to the all Indian operative to Indian operated distances they remain unchanged from dry runway You may think right now Well, if I have a wet or contaminated runway where I have snow or slush and surely that's gonna change the distances Takeoff Not exactly. Okay, so we heard it was a little harsh there. I kind of it sounded bad my headphones Hopefully you guys heard on your end. I'm gonna do the same thing with point five here And I'm gonna look around that two thousand kilohertz range or two thousand to K range I always get all messed up people say two thousand then I say kilohertz which is kilohertz is thousands You guys know what I mean the 2k the 2k right here So I want to change my point type right here to this guy the bell curve here So that way I can bring it up and change it like this however I need to so I'm gonna play through I'm gonna do the same thing with point three and point two and then give it a listen here And let's see what we could find when it comes to the all Indian operative to Indian operated distances They remain unchanged from dry runway. You may think right now Well, if I have a wet or contaminated runway where I have Snow or slush and surely that's gonna change the distances for takeoff when it comes to the all Indian operative to Indian operated distances they remain unchanged from dry runway You may think right now Well, if I have a wet or contaminated runway where I have snow or slush and surely that's gonna change the distances for takeoff Not exactly What changes is the amount? Okay, so could you hear those harsh frequencies around that point five and The point number three so point five is around two and a half kilohertz or whatever about 2.4 K and depending on somebody's voice obviously people's voices have different, you know Frequency ranges you could go up to 3k maybe at most but usually between that say 800 to two and a half K that's where you're gonna find harsh frequencies and harsh sounds for pretty much every microphone that I've ever tried so and I know with This microphone I mean because it's the same microphone that I use that these are the kind of spots where I've noticed, you know problems with my recordings Now point number three here. It's a little lower. It's around 425 Hertz and that's kind of where some some boominous lives It's not quite like the the bass boomy But it just it didn't sound good and we wanted to drop that frequency out now if it sounds a little thin We can use point number two to kind of bring up the bass a little bit But let me listen to it I'm gonna move that point two up and down a little bit We may not even need it because you don't want too much bass and dialogue because it's just gonna make it sound muddy But you might want a little bit. I mean you you don't want the voice to sound hollow So let's listen in and see what we could do with point number two and remember you don't have to use all the points Just use enough to kind of take care of the problem areas That's all you're trying to do is take care of problems and that's in turn is gonna help clean up your audio when it comes to the All-Indian Operative two engine operating distances they remain unchanged from dry runway You may think right now Well, if I have a wet or contaminated runway where I have snow or slush and surely that's gonna change the distances for takeoff Not exactly What changes is the amount of weight you can take off with Giving those contaminated conditions. All right, I think that's pretty good. We did a slight boost I mean just a little bit. It's really hard to tell. I think it helps just a little bit now I'm gonna play through this one more time I'm gonna turn the EQ off to start and then we're gonna turn it on and see if we can hear a difference See how it sounded so far. So here we go When it comes to the all-Indian Operative two engine operating distances they remain unchanged from dry runway You may think right now Well, if I have a wet or contaminated runway where I have snow or slush and surely that's gonna change the distances But take a wet or contaminated runway where I have snow or slush All right, so I ended up turning off point two there or dropping it down just a little bit because I don't think it's helping anything I think it kind of muddies it up a little so I'm gonna turn off that point to we're gonna actually just bring that base kind of Back to where it was because we don't want it to be muddy We want to be crisp and clear. I think the background noise did get cleaned up a little bit We do hear that hiss or hum or whatever it might be We have a effect that we're gonna try to use to get rid of that when we get there So we'll see if that'll work But I think for now this is probably good enough EQ to get started now one thing to keep in mind is you want to try and make Your environment the best that you can right in here in my studio. I've got sound blankets all the way around me Right, so it's killing a lot of extra noise extra sound my microphone is very directional coming only towards me So your environment makes a big impact on your recording now I don't know where the background noise is coming from in this particular recording But I would check my environment check my cables. It sounds like there's some kind of interference or something going on there I would check I check all that stuff to make sure you don't have that So you don't have to try and clean it up because it's easier to just get right the first time I don't only have to do minor work as opposed to having to get in here and Really work with you know all kinds of tools to try and get rid of some kind of background noise like that So just something to keep in mind make sure your environment is as good as you can get it So with the EQ kind of set here I'm gonna go ahead and close that down and now we're gonna jump into the dynamics so dynamics right here You want to double-click on that now the first thing that I like to do is I like to add a little bit of compression So compression is gonna help reduce the distance between the loud parts and the quiet parts So it kind of brings the quiet parts up and it brings down the loud parts of the video a little bit So it kind of balances it out you can look at it that way everything We're trying to balance everything you don't want it to be all of a sudden you're listening and boom is so loud It's blowing your ears off But then you don't want to be so quiet that you got to ride your volume on your your remote control there right you got to go I'm gonna go louder. I'm gonna go quieter. I'm gonna go louder quieter. You don't want to have to do that So compression is gonna help take care of that for you and kind of even things out and reduce the dynamic range of your audio So let's turn it on here. I'm not gonna go through every single thing here. I'm just gonna make some some adjustments I'm gonna probably drop my threshold back a little bit and I'm gonna use the makeup here to boost the quieter part So let's just listen we're gonna play through it and I'm gonna adjust the compressor here and see what we can do When it comes to the all in denobative to engine Now I'm also watching my levels over here to use the makeup to get back around that minus 10 DB And I'm adjusting my threshold down a little bit as well as my ratio for my compression We don't want to go too crazy I usually do either two to one or you can go up as much as maybe three to one for dialogue You really probably don't want to go more than three to one But you know use it on your clip you decide what sounds best on your clip when it comes to the all Indian operative to engine operating distances they remain unchanged from dry runway You may think right now Well, if I have a wet or contaminated runway where I have snow or slush and surely that's gonna change the distances But take off okay now You notice what I did there as I kind of set my compressor and then I came over and I used my expander now the expander helped get rid of some of that noise in between the words that he's saying there and It kind of helps take care of some of that static in there now Is it a perfectly smooth transition? No so we can play with the attack hold and release a little bit to smoothen that out a little bit But it's gonna help with some of that background noise that happens in between where the voice is hope that makes sense to you So if you're looking at your you know your your graph over here for example, we'll get that out of there In between where he's talking that's where the expander is gonna help take care of that now You can also use a gate a gate can make more of a hard cut at a certain Decibel level whereas the expander just kind of drops it down a little bit So those two you know you can choose between there what you want to use I do have full videos on all this stuff that I can link to I'll actually put a link up up here You can check that out that goes in depth with all the knobs buttons dials everything on here that you could take a look at So if you're interested in the the how the why what the buttons mean you could check out those videos But for now, I'm just gonna tweak this a little bit more and then we're gonna move on to the next step So I made a few adjustments there, I think I'm happy with that is it perfect No, ideally you get a better recording to start with but we're doing the best we can here quickly with what we've got So I'm gonna go ahead and close my dynamics and next we want to take a look at some of the effects One other thing I forgot to mention and this is my bad right here check out the order right here for our audio By default it said on effects dynamics and then EQ and we actually want to change that the way I like to do it is To have the EQ then the dynamics then the effects come in So I'm gonna go ahead and change that and it will change the way your audio sounds because it's changing the routing of how it's getting Processed now. I'm not saying my way is a hundred percent right It's the only way to do it they give you options because you can do it different ways and it depends on how you like your audio How you want it to sound and the things you're trying to do to it So you might want to change it or leave it at the default that's up to you But this is just how I like to do it Alright, so let's listen to it one more time here and let's figure out what are the other problem areas that maybe we can use some effects to help fix There's definitely that background static noise, whatever We're gonna try and fix that but let's listen to see what else we might hear Operated distances they remain unchanged from dry runway You may think right now Well, if I have a wet or contaminated runway where I have alright, so first let's see if we can get rid of that home I don't know if it's gonna work, but there is an effect we can try if we go to effects and then we come down to Restoration and then we go fairlight effects. There is a dehummer now. I don't know if this gonna work We're gonna try it so I believe there are yes two presets of 50 Hertz and a 60 Hertz So let's try this one first 60 Hertz and see if it does anything. I don't know if it will let's try it out and see what happens You know, but if two engine operated distances they remain unchanged from dry runway Engine operated distances they remain unchanged from dry runway Alright, so unfortunately it didn't do anything a lot of times this will effect and fix Electrical hum and electrical noise that you might hear interference that kind of thing it didn't work here So I'm just gonna go ahead and get rid of it and delete it off of our effects here So the next thing that I like to add is a multi band compressor just to kind of help compress the different frequency ranges So to get there we're gonna go ahead effects hit the plus Come down to dynamics fairlight effects and multi band compressor Now let's just play through with the default settings here and see how it sounds I'm gonna start with it off then turn it on see what we got when it comes to the all Indian operative to engine operated distances they remain unchanged from dry runway You may think right now Well, if I have a wet or contaminated runway where I have snow or slush and surely that's gonna change the distances or take off not exactly What changes is the amount of weight you can take off with Given those contaminated conditions when it comes to the all Indian operative to engine operated distances They remain unchanged from dry runway Okay, so I think the multi band compressor here does do a pretty good job You notice I did update some of the default settings there. I did kind of change where the low mid and high Uh Separations were I moved the high up a little bit. I moved the mid up a little bit as well as the low and I think you can hear The difference there. I think it kind of cleans it up a little bit more. We still have a de-esser. We're gonna apply But let's listen in and see how it sounds To the all Indian operative to engine Okay, there's with it when it comes to the all Indian operative to engine operated distances, so I think I'm happy with that I think the multi band compressor does a good job of compressing some of our lower end frequencies As well as we're bringing down the high end frequencies a little bit where there's some of that, you know harsh s sound So I'm happy with that. So now I'm gonna go ahead and apply a de-esser Gonna hit the plus sign and I'm gonna come down to Restoration fair light effects and de-esser now we can use a preset here. I'm gonna go ahead and click the little drop down We've got mail ESS mail s All right, so let's see how this does I'm gonna turn it off and then turn it on as we're playing to the all Indian operative to engine operated distances they remain unchanged from dry runway To the all when it comes to the and if you want to listen to the eat that it's sounds only We're gonna check on this and just see how this sounds right now Well, if I have a wet or contaminated runway where I have snow or slush and surely that's gonna change the distances And changing it back slash and surely that's gonna change the distances Comes to the all Indian operative to engine operated distances Okay, so we could see that the de-esser is working pretty good there I do like the way it sounds with the wider curve here So I'm gonna stick with that and that's gonna be it I'm gonna go ahead and close this up and now let's listen to the full clip here with no processing nothing done And then it's gonna go straight into our process audio I'll put it down on the bottom of the screen which one is which and let's just see how it sounds Hopefully we made it sound better when it comes to the all Indian operative to engine Operated distances they remain unchanged from dry runway when it comes to the all Indian operative to engine operated distances they remain unchanged from dry runway So I think we did make a good improvement here on our audio clip. The biggest issue here is that background noise It's really distracting It's it breaks up the audio a lot, especially with headphones on it's very noticeable I noticed when I listened on my studio monitors here, it was less noticeable So it wasn't as bad and probably on laptop speakers. It's even you know less less of a problem there But on headphones, it's very noticeable and it's distracting now We're gonna jump back into fair light and try the built-in noise reduction Usually I don't use it because it doesn't work good and then we're also gonna try a noise reduction plug-in from waves Who has some awesome plug-ins here for DaVinci resolve you may have seen my video on the clarity vx It's not that one We're actually gonna try a different plug-in that runs natively right here in resolve that does a fantastic job as well So let's jump back and resolve get into fair light and try the built-in noise reduction and see how that does so back in To fair light here. Let's go ahead and click on the plus. We are gonna come down to restoration Fairlight effects and noise reduction now first. I'm just gonna try the auto speech mode and let's see what happens Oh, actually before we do that. I'm gonna go ahead and turn off my In my dynamics here. I'm gonna turn off my expander because that's limiting the background noise So now it's just no background noise is getting eliminated or anything like that So let's just play through you can see what it sounds like without the Expander on there. Here's what it sounds like When it comes to the all engine operative to engine operated distances, okay, so very distracting now if I turn on the noise reduction I'm just gonna use auto speech mode. Everything else is at the default. Let's see how it does When it comes to the all engine operative to engine operated distances, they remain unchanged from dry runway All right, so it does help there The only thing I don't like about this tool is a lot of times if it does work It makes the audio sound very like tinny like very high-end like you almost like you're in a tin can That's one of the problems with this Built-in noise reduction now We can try the manual mode and let it learn in order to do that you want to click manual here Then you want to come back to your audio clip and we need a space where there's no No speaking where we've just got the background noise. I'm gonna hit learn and I'm gonna only play that part with the background noise All right, so now that it's learned it we can go back listen see how that worked When it comes to the all engine operative to engine operated distances they remain unchanged Okay, so I mean it's okay It's I don't know that it's any better than the auto speech mode, but it still doesn't work great in my opinion So generally I'm not gonna use the built-in noise reduction unless I absolutely have to to really try and save something And even then it's probably still not gonna be great. So let's go ahead and remove this Default noise reduction. We're gonna get rid of that and now we're gonna add in that waves plug-in. This is the NS1 Noise reduction plug-in. So again, I'm gonna come to effects. I'm gonna come down to restoration VST and all the way down here. I've got NS1 stereo Now this is the NS1 noise suppressor from waves very basic I'm just gonna grab this slider and bring it up to get rid of that background noise Let's see how well that this does on our clip here. So I'm gonna play through and raise this guy up see what we got When it comes to the all engine operative to engine operated distances, they remain unchanged from dry runway You may think right now Well, if I have a wet or contaminated runway where I have snow or slush and surely that's gonna change the distances But take off not exactly What changes is the amount of weight you can take off with? Given those contaminated conditions. So right there hundred percent better job at removing that background noise Then the built-in noise reduction. So again, this is the waves NS1 I'll link it in the description below if you want to go check it out, but the waves plugins do a fan Tastic job. I mean audio is what they do primarily for music But it works for video editing too, and they do a great job Now if you did see my waves clarity VX plugin, you know that resolve has to run in Rosetta to run that clarity plugin But this one the NS1 runs natively you could just load it up and resolve and you're good to go But another disclaimer about the wave stuff is that DaVinci resolve is not officially supported by waves However, it works fine on Windows works fine on Mac. I've had no issues. A lot of people have great success with it I think they're fantastic plugins There's a couple of them like I said that need to run in Rosetta, but the majority of them run natively on Mac Here so just putting that out there in case you guys were wondering or if you have problems and you reach out to wave support And they say hey, we don't support resolve Technically they don't but it does work and people have had great success with them So that wraps up this episode of I edit your audio guys If you want to submit a file for me to take a look at there's a link in the description below to a Google form You can go and submit your stuff over there and I'm gonna try and do some more of these because I think it's helpful for you guys to Just see how I would edit your audio or just watch somebody go through and edit your particular clip And if you do submit your file I'm gonna send you back a DaVinci resolve file with all the changes in it that I made so you can see what I did and then you Can get in there and play within tweak things based on my settings and then change it to however you might like it or you Can even save it as a preset too so that way the next time you make a video you just hit that preset and boom you're good to go That wraps up this one guys. Thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next episode. Peace
