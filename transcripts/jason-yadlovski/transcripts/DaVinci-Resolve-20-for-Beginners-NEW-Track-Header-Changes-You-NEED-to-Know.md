Hey, did you notice that something looks a little different here in DaVinci Resolve 20? That's right, they completely redesigned the track headers here and the icons that you're used to seeing are no longer there and we've got some new icons as well as some new features. And if you don't know how it all works, you might feel a little stuck. So in this video, I'm going to walk you through all the new changes in the track header in DaVinci Resolve 20. I'm going to tell you where the auto track selector went. We're going to talk about the new source and destination buttons and how they work. And there's even some new features in there like Sync Lock that should help you with your edits once you understand how it works. So if you're brand new to DaVinci Resolve, you're going to want to know how these features work in the track header because you're going to use them in every edit. And if you've been around Resolve a little while, you got to watch this too because things have changed. It's not the same and you want to know how it works. So let's jump in Resolve and I'm going to show you these new updates. In DaVinci Resolve here, I'm in the edit tab and let's take a look at the new track headers over here on the left. Now you can change the size of your tracks by holding shift in your middle mouse wheel to make them smaller or bigger. So you scroll up or scroll down, it's going to change the size of it. But let's take a look at some of the information we have in our new track headers here. First thing we notice, there is a red highlighted box with a V1 in there. That's new. And I'm going to explain what that is in a second. We've got our track lock, which is something that has always been there. We can lock our track so you can't make any changes to it. We have our disable sync lock, which we'll talk about in a minute. And then we have our disable video track. So if I were to hit that, it turns off the whole video track and then we can't see anything in there. So I'm going to turn on the video track for now. Getting started with the new features here, this right here, this red outlined box. What is that? What does it mean? And what am I supposed to do with it? Well that is kind of like the auto track selector used to be, right? We used to have that in our old track header, but in this case, now we have this little red box. And if we click on it, we can change it. We can turn it on and off. So when it's highlighted, that means it's on. And for example, if we look on my timeline here where my playhead is, if I hit my cut key, and then if I move ahead here, you can see it made a cut on all of the tracks. But let's say maybe I didn't want to cut the audio tracks, I only wanted to cut the video tracks. So if I can do that, I can turn on or off any of the audio tracks. So for example, let's say I turn off the first two tracks there, I'm going to go ahead and make a cut. And now you can see it only affected my video track. That's essentially what the auto track selector used to do. And this is how you would use that feature now. Now a little bonus, if you hold your option or alt key and click on one of them, it'll invert whatever you have selected. So in this case, I have one selected, if I hold option or alt and click on two, then it'll select the opposite. Another nice thing is that you can just click on one hole and drag and it'll change all of them at once. And the same thing with the video tracks, you can turn them on or off. And that way you're only affecting the tracks that you want to effect. If you want to affect all of them, then you would just leave it in its default settings with all of these red boxes turned on. So that is the auto track selector. And that's what it looks like now in DaVinci Resolve 20. Now going along with this red box right here, you might notice that if you were to click on a file in your media pool, for example, if I click on this one and I bring it up in my viewer here, you're going to see a whole another set of boxes, a bunch of blue colored boxes right next to the red colored boxes. Now what these blue icons represent is what is selected in your media pool. And most of the time that's going to be what's in your source viewer. But if I were to select something different, not double click it, but single click in my media pool here, you're going to see we only have V1 and V2 right here. If I select on this other clip, you can see we have V1, but then we have a one through a six. So what this is showing you is that my clip that's in my media pool right here has one video track and six audio tracks associated with it. How can I double check that? Well, if I came to my clip, I right clicked clip attributes, and I'm in the audio section here, you can see here's all my audio tracks. Now I just made this up here so that way you guys can see what it's doing. But let's say if I cancel this out that for this particular clip, I only want to use maybe the first audio track for whatever reason, I can deselect these others, just turn them off. So now when I come to my clip in the media pool here or in my viewer and I drag it down into the timeline, it's only going to bring the one audio track. If I go to a spot in my timeline, that's not already full, drag it down, you can see it only brings one video track and one audio track. Now if I were to select all of these and turn them all back on, now if I were to drag and drop that clip, you can see it brings all of the audio tracks. So it's going to work like this for both your video and your audio tracks. You can tell resolve, hey, this is the track I want to bring in, only use that one, or you can use a different track if you'd like to. So the blue ones are looking at the file that's in your media pool or in your viewer right here. Now if I don't have anything selected in my media pool, or if I were to double click over here by my bins, you'll see they all disappear because I don't have a clip selected. Select that clip and now we're going to see all of the tracks available built within that clip. And we can also change the order of where these things will fall. So if I were to delete this clip and let's say I want the video from my source file to go on the track two, and then I'm going to turn off all those, but I want to maybe move track two from my clip, you know, put it on these two tracks on track three and four. By using these, we're telling resolve where we want this file to go. If we were to use any of like the tools right here in our toolbar, or if we click held, dragged our clip over top of the timeline here, we did say, for example, an insert. You can see it put it on track two right here, and then it put our two audio tracks onto a three and a four. So it's a really handy tool if you work with files that have more than one audio track, for example, associated with it, or if it's maybe a compound clip or something like that that's got multiple video tracks in it, and you just want to use a specific one, you can select that with these buttons right here. And another little bonus tip for you here when it comes to our source or our media pool tracks here, these little blue icons, we can just right click on any one of them and change it instead of dragging it around if you wanted to. And it's just another option of how you can kind of sort that stuff out. So those are two handy additions here. I think while the blue ones may come in handy, depending on what you're doing, the knowing what these red ones do here are much more valuable to you because it's something you might use all the time. And instead of having to lock the track, you can just turn off that auto track selector there and then you won't affect that track when you're making cuts and doing things like that. And another bonus piece of info here for you if you came up to timeline, came down to source track selector, we can also change any of our options right in there, as well as our auto select, you've got different options there along with all the keyboard shortcuts in case that's something that you need. So the next icon we have here in the toolbar is the sync lock and by default, this is turned on. And what this is going to help with is making sure that your clips either ripple, delete and stay in sync. Or if you don't want them to stay in sync, you can turn that off on an individual track basis. So for example, in my timeline, if I have a video clip and two audio clips, and maybe I want to make a cut on the audio clips, if I have all the track selectors turned on, like you see right now they're highlighted, and I were to ripple, delete a cut right here, and I only have those two tracks selected. So that should be all that gets affected. I can ripple delete it and you can see it keeps all these in sync, right? It's going to go ahead and ripple delete those as well on the video tracks. So if I undo that, and now if I wanted to select these again, and if I turn off my sync lock, now it's going to go out of sync when I ripple delete this. So if I hit ripple delete, you can see now we're off by 4.24 seconds or four seconds, 24 frames. So while it may not be something you want to use on like a piece of dialogue and video clip like this, maybe if you've got some other kind of B roll clip, and you either do or do not want it to be affected by ripple, deletes and ripple edits, then you can turn that on and off. So when this is turned on right here, it ripples with other tracks. And when it's disabled, so if we were to turn it off like that, it's not highlighted, it works as like a solo on the track. And it does not ripple edit operations on other tracks. So that one can come in real handy if you're doing a lot of ripple cutting and deleting and stuff and you don't want certain things to move when you're making those ripple cuts on other parts of your project. Another thing that looks a little bit different here when it comes to the track headers is the name. So we've got our video one, video two, you can still double click in there and change it to whatever you want. It just looks a little bit different. It's not quite as big. Same with the audio tracks. You can double click it and change that to whatever you want. Another tip for you is if you're messing around with the track destination stuff and it gets a little too out of whack, an easy way to fix that is to come up to the timeline menu at the top of the screen, come down to track source selector and choose reset track selectors. And then it's going to put everything back to the default settings for you. So now that you understand the new track headers here in DaVinci Resolve 20, you should be off and running. Go ahead, create your projects and go make something awesome. If you have any questions on any of this, I'm happy to help you out. Drop me a comment. I'm pretty good at getting back to you fairly quickly. Try to stay on top of that for you in case you get stuck, but happy to help you out if you need it. And a shameless plug for myself here. If you're looking to learn how to edit your audio to make it sound awesome. I got a course for you. You might be interested in audio essentials for video editors in DaVinci Resolve.
