Today, quick awesome tip here for you to hear a little before and after when you're working with a lot of effects on your audio. Jump and resolve, check this out. So sometimes I want to hear a little before and after of my audio effects just to make sure things are in the right spot or maybe I need to double check something without all of the effects applied.

So when we see this yellow light turned on right here, we know that the effects are being inserted onto the track. Now if I want a quick before and after with my effects here, you could come to your effects and click on and off all these little buttons, but nobody wants to do that. All you have to do is come to your effects in and turn that off. Make sure it's not lit up. And now you're going to hear the before all of your effects are applied. So check it out.
