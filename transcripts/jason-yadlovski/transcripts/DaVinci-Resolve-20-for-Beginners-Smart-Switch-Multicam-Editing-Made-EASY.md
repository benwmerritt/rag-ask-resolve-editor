Multi-cam editing can feel overwhelming, but what if I told you there was a tool here in DaVinci Resolve 20 that allows you to get that job done a whole lot quicker and with a lot less stress? Sounds pretty good, right? And that's exactly what we're going to talk about today the new Multi-cam smart switch tool here in DaVinci Resolve 20. It is a studio only version But if you only have the free version you want to watch this so you know how it all works in case you decided to upgrade a studio one day And by the end of this video, you're gonna be switching multi-cam angles like pro So let's just jump in resolve and I'm gonna show you how this smart cut tool works here And you're gonna be off and running making multi-cam videos in no time In DaVinci Resolve here in order to start working with the multi-cam smart switch we first need a multi-cam clip So here's how we're gonna create that in my media pool here. I've got three different clips I've got a wide shot a tight shot and an iPhone shot, so I'm just gonna window over these select them I'm gonna right click and say create new multi-cam clip using selected clips That's gonna bring up this window for us. We can name the multi-cam clip whatever we want. So let's just call it Multi-cam clip start timecode you can adjust that if you want. I'm gonna leave it at its default frame rate It should match the clips that are in your timeline automatically, but if it doesn't you can change that I like to sync it by sound because most of the time I don't have timecode or anything like that You can do it within and out points, but I'm gonna use sound the next one channel right here is if you want to select a Certain channel to use to sync up your audio in this case I'm gonna use automatic for multi-cam audio if we click on this drop down if you had a reference angle that you wanted to use To sync everything else up to you can select that or you could just leave it on the default setting there angle name Generally, I just leave that on sequential and then you can look at these other options and decide if you want to check those on or not So I'm gonna go ahead and click create once we've done that We actually have our multi-cam clip which is right here So I want to create a new timeline with this multi-cam clip I'm gonna right-click on the clip create new timeline using selected clips You can call it whatever you want good to click create So now I've got my multi-cam clip right here in my timeline and if I take a look at it Here we are with a multi-cam sample clip. I've got camera Okay, it's got the iPhone angle there by default if you want to change your default angle you can do that by just selecting it right click and Switch multi-cam angle and you can select whatever you want So let's say I'm just gonna put the wide shot there on as my default angle So now we want to use the multi-cam smart switch feature So all you have to do is select your clip You're gonna right-click and come to multi-cam smart switch right here So this window will pop up for you and it's gonna give us some options on how we can set up our smart switch So just running over this window real quick angle switching the minimum edit duration So this is how long do you want one cut to stay where it is in this case? It's set at one second. Let's say maybe I want it to be two seconds So regardless of what the tool as it runs and creates the cuts It won't make anything less than two seconds So you can set that to whatever you want the next option here the edit change delay is how long will it be delayed? Before someone else starts speaking so if you've got a podcast you got two people speaking How long is it gonna stay on a particular shot before it changes and cuts to another angle? So you can see by default it's set to point three seconds here. So that's fine I'm gonna leave that where it's at for now. So the wide angle setup here This is gonna be used so that the AI and the smart switch can use a wide angle shot to cover spaces where people might be talking Over each other or talking at the same time. It's gonna look at the video It's gonna look at the audio and it's gonna say oh, hey, we got two people overlapping and talking Let's just go with the wide shot so we can see both people in the shot in my case It's only me but if you're setting this up for something like a podcast or an interview or something like that where you're have multiple people on A wide angle shot you can use these options in here to dictate how that's gonna react for the smart switch so you can choose automatically detect wide angles and The smart switch is gonna decide what makes the most sense or when it makes the most sense to use that wide angle To cover up people talking at the same time now if you know what the wide angle is you can uncheck the automatic one and Select your angle right there and use that in this case. I'm gonna try it with the automatic detection The wide angle frequency So how often is it gonna cut to the wide angle you could do it low which is like a little bit high Which is a lot you decide what you want it to do we've also got options to use the wide angle for the intro and outro and Use wide angle for silence So if there's you know some space maybe you're doing something or showing something when there's that silence You don't want the tight shot on your head right? You're gonna want the wide angle so we can see what you're doing down on your desk or whatever So I'm actually gonna uncheck use wide angle for intro and outro because I know I was talking to that camera the tight camera While I was doing my intro there and then you've got smart switch set up here You can choose your quality. You want to do it faster. You want to do it better Do you want to use audio only for analysis because the way this tool works is it actually looks at the video looks at people's mouths moving and Also combines that with the analysis of the audio and that's how it kind of decides on when to make cuts and when to switch angles So it depends on your situation if you only want to use the audio perfectly fine in this case I'm gonna allow it to do its thing and use both the video and the audio So once we've got all our settings where we want it I'm just gonna go ahead and click analyze now depending on how long your video is it may take some time to do this It is AI stuff So the stronger your computer the more power you got the quicker these kind of things are gonna work for me This is a 30 second clip and it looks like it's gonna take maybe a minute or two Although I did try it with a longer clip and it was gonna take like 20 minutes So I kind of canceled that and came up with a smaller example So it just depends on how much you want to do if you have a whole podcast Maybe you just set it let it run walk away You have a set of coffee or something and then come back when it's all finished So once you've gone ahead and run the multi cam smart switch tool If you have two people or multiple people in your multi cam video It's gonna work better for me in my case because it's just me I actually changed my voice tone a little bit just to kind of help it make some cuts on just me as an individual So here's what it looks like once it does a cut and if you have multiple people It should cut to the person that's talking when they're talking and go to a wide angle shot When you have multiple people talking at a time. So here's what it looks like here. We are with a multi cam sample clip I've got camera one right there. I've got a wide camera to right there And I'm holding camera 3 my phone right over here can have as many angles as you want This is gonna work out pretty good for you So we want to show you how this smart cut tool works here in DaVinci resolve a reminder It's only studio, but if you don't have studio you want to watch this anyway because you want to know how to use it case You ever upgrade. All right, let's Jump into resolve. So there you go. You can see it changed the angles right based on the voice Now I did just kind of you know create my own little Multi voice thing there just so it could have a better, you know way to look at what it's cutting up But if you have multiple people, it's gonna be able to recognize the different voices It's gonna look at the video and see who's talking whose mouth is moving when and it's really gonna do a pretty good job at For you at making that first pass of cutting everything up for you Now what if you wanted to change an angle? Maybe it didn't get something right Maybe you got the wrong angle somewhere you can adjust that too so in your timeline All you have to do is come to the clip you want to change And if you want to change both the audio and the video angle you can just select your clip right click Switch multi cam angle and choose whatever angle you want If you only want to change say the video but not the audio or the audio and not the video The way to do that is just use your option or alt key and select your clip So you're only selecting either the video or the audio you only want to select one of them And then in that case we can change the angle for that clip that's highlighted So in this case, let's actually do the audio clip gonna select our clip because right now We can see there's no audio there gonna right click come down to switch multi cam angle I'm gonna choose angle one there and now we've got our close tight shot But we have our audio from the phone shot check it out Yeah, how this smart cut tool works here in DaVinci resolve a reminder It's only studio but so you can see how we could change just the video or just the audio angle if we need to now in most cases Like I said, this is gonna work the best if you have multiple people in your multi cam scene If you just have one person like me It probably isn't gonna work great if your voice is the same all the way throughout this I just chopped it up and changed the the pitch of my voice a little bit to help it see some differences there And it will come out a lot smoother than what mine is It's cuz I kind of chopped it up and chopped it together for you there But the real magic is how it switches angles looks at the audio and the video who speaking and does all that switch And automatically for you it does a good first pass and then you got to go But through check it out and if you need to make any changes or adjustments You can do that very easily with no problem keep in mind that this multi cam smart switch tool is only available in studio Okay, I want to make that clear. It's only in studio But you can create multi cam clips right in the free version of DaVinci resolve. So if you have any questions comments I'm happy to help you guys out more. My name is Jason.
