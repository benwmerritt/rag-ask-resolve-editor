## Transcript
A YouTube channel with 872,000 subscribers reached out to me and asked for a little help with their audio. You might be wondering why I've got this band-aid on my head. We'll talk about that later in the video. But today we're going to be doing a real-world audio edit for a YouTube channel named Mary's Kitchen. They have 872,000 subscribers and they ran into a little issue with their audio and we're looking for some help to fix it. So I love doing these kind of videos because it just shows you how I would kind of go through the process to fix problems that you might run into. And in this case, their external audio recorder failed. So the only audio that they have is the audio that was recorded internally on a Canon C70, which, you know, isn't the best, but at least they have something to start with. So we're going to jump in resolve, take a look at it, see how we can fix it up, make it sound the best we can, and then I'm going to send them back a file so they can see the audio edits and apply them to their video. Now, another interesting note is that this is not in English, right? So I have no idea what they're talking about. I don't speak the language that they make their videos in. But the thing with audio is that we're just going by what it sounds, right? A lot of times when I edit my audio, I don't care what the people are saying. I want to know how it sounds and I'm listening to the sounds. So that'll be an interesting challenge in this one too. We don't know what they're talking about, but we're going to make it sound the best that we can. Let's jump in resolve. Check it out. Individually, resolve here. I've got a project set up. I've got a timeline set up and we just have the audio that we're going to be working with here today. So what I did was take the clip that they had sent me and I broke it down into two different tracks to start with here. And the reason I did that is because this first section here, you can see it looks quite a bit louder and it sounds a little bit different than the audio down in track number two. So I just separated it out so we can work with it separately. Now, let me play a little bit of this for you. Now, you may not understand it like I don't understand it, but we can listen to it and we can think about some of the things that don't sound good or that we might want to try and fix. So here's a little sample of what this sounds like. I'm going to read my recipe. So here I have a paprika, dry, провansal grass, dry garlic. So let's go ahead and jump over into Fairlight. Musical notes at the bottom. So in Fairlight, the first thing I think I want to do here is get better levels for these clips because if I play through the clips, I'm just going to mute it so we can see our meters here. We're way up in the red. We're almost peeking out to the top and that is not what I want to do. Ideally, I want these levels to be around minus 10 dB. So you could come in here and right click and choose Normalize Audio Levels. And if I use what I usually use, the sample peak program, when I normalize it, it actually gets too quiet because now when I play through it, we see it's too quiet. It's down there where I don't want it to be. So we could use different normalization methods there, but instead I'm going to undo that and I'm just going to lower it manually a little bit. So let's try about here. I want to make sure like I don't have peaks going off too much there, but let's just see kind of where this falls. And I'm just looking at the meters here and it's peeking up a little bit, but that's okay. I want to see if it's averaging around that minus 10 dB. Maybe I need to lower it down just a little bit more and that looks all right. It's okay if it's going to go over a little bit. Now, if it's clipped, it's clipped. We're not going to be able to get that information back. But in order to kind of deal with these peaks that we see all along here, we're going to want to use a little bit of compression to do that. So let's unmute our audio here and give it a quick listen. I like it. I'm going to read my recipe. So here I have paprika. Okay. So it does. I mean, you can hear the clipping a little bit in there. So now that we've got our level set here pretty good for this clip, we want to start working with it to kind of clean it up and make it sound the best we can. So the first thing I'm going to do is going to zoom out a little bit. And I like to just select this portion of my clip here so I can just loop it and it'll just play over and over again as I make some changes. So you can just set some in and out points. I'm just going to hit O right here. Going to turn on my looping icon. And now when I start in the beginning here, it'll just loop over and over again. I'm actually going to bring in this first point here so we can just keep listening to this section over and over again. The next thing I want to do is set the order of operations. And in this case, I want to go EQ dynamics then effects. And now let's go ahead and get started with our EQ. So I'm going to double click the EQ, open that up. Now we're going to play through and I'm going to make some adjustments here. Then I'm going to explain to you what I did. So let's play through and make some EQ adjustments here. One kilogram of chicken breast. I cut it into small pieces and marinated it. It was kept in the fridge for two hours. Now I'm going to list the marinade ingredients. You can of course choose your own taste, what you like, how you like it. I'm going to list my own recipe. So here I have paprika, dry provansal herbs, dry garlic, coriander and everything is coated with soy sauce. That's why it's so dark. It was kept in the fridge for two hours. Everything was absorbed well and there are delicious aromas. I didn't add salt because there is salt in soy sauce. I cut the onion into small strips. I also cut the sweet peppers, carrots, garlic and a clove of garlic. And I cut it. It's very suitable. Then I grabbed my .2 here and around that 400 Hertz there was just some kind of boxiness that I didn't like. So I reduced the frequencies in that range a little bit. When it comes to dialogue, a lot of times things that might not sound so great might be in that 800 to 2K range somewhere in there. So in this case I'm around 1K right here with point number three and just made a little cut there. And then I took off some of the high end there. There's the higher pitched frequencies that we just don't need when it comes to our dialogue. So you heard the little click before and after there. I think it made a pretty good difference. We're going to leave this where it is for now and we can move on to the next step. Now one thing you have up here is equalizer type. Right now it's on fire. I'm going to change it to earth. These all mean different things. They cause the equalizer to react a little bit differently. They don't make a huge difference, but just a little bit of a difference. So I'm going to leave this one on earth. So the next thing I want to do is work with my dynamics and take care of these peaks up in here that we see. And just kind of balance out the audio a little bit. Right? We've got quieter part here at the end and a louder part here. So let's actually just bring our area that we're going to loop right here. So we can kind of balance this all out a little bit. So I'm going to go ahead and open up my dynamics. And we can start with one of the presets if we wanted to. We could try some basic compression and see how that does. So let's just get started there. So this is the simple and easy one. And spaghetti. I'm using these ordinary thin spaghetti in a pan. I've already put a little bit of salt in it. I'm turning on the stove. Let it heat up and heat it up. I've made two rice cups here. I'm going to pour four cups of water into two cups. I'm also taking the same amount of the dishes. I'm going to wash the rice up before I put it in the pan. I'm using these ordinary thin spaghetti in a pan. I've already poured the water in. I'm turning on the stove. Let it heat up and heat up. I've made two rice cups here. So we can notice one thing. When it gets to the smaller waveforms here, it actually sounds like it's another clip maybe. You know, like things changed a little bit. Maybe they moved the camera. They changed the audio level. Something. It sounds a little bit different. But we can see that the compressor is doing its job there. And we notice that where these peaks are a little bit taller, we have a lot more background noise, right? This section right here where the waveforms are a little bit smaller. So let's go ahead and apply an expander. And let's see if we can just use the expander here to kind of help clean up some of the background noise in between the words and phrases that they're saying. Okay, so in this case I think the expander is working. Now I'm using the expander here because it's in the free version of Resolve. And you can use it if you've got the free version. Now if you have studio, voice isolation would take care of that background noise in no time. And I think that would be the best tool to use on this, which we're going to try that in a little bit here. So let's go ahead and put it in the studio. And we're going to put it in the studio. And we're going to put it in the studio. And I think that would be the best tool to use on this, which we're going to try that in a little bit here. But I think that for now I think the expander is going to do a decent job just kind of helping out with some of that background noise a little bit. So I do want to make sure that I'm checking my output levels here and making sure our dialogue is still around that minus 10 dB right here because that's where we want it to be at the end of our video. So as we make adjustments and changes, we may need to boost up this audio a little bit just so we can stay around this minus 10 dB. And it looks pretty good. I mean, it's not going to be consistent there, but it looks pretty good. So now let's take a look at some effects. Now there is a built-in noise reduction tool here in DaVinci Resolve in the free version that you can try out. We're going to give it a try here real quick. I don't know if it's going to work good. Typically I find that it doesn't work great, but it's worth a try. So in your effects, hit the plus icon here. We want to come down to restoration, Fairlight effects, and we have the noise reduction. Now we can try the auto speech mode here and just play through it and see what happens and see if that helps. Let's just give it a try here. Okay, so it actually doesn't do a terrible job. Surprisingly, it's not too bad. Now it may be because we're putting it on top of the expander that we already turned on, but it's not doing too bad of a job there. Now you could use the manual mode here and learn a section right here where there's no audio, you've just got the background noise. But I think this is a decent start. I think I'm going to leave it where it's at. If you need a little more, you can adjust your output level if you need to make sure that we're, again, at that minus 10 dB or so. You can add more or less of the effect by changing the wet-dry mix right there. So I think this is kind of helping. Let's just jump to the end of the clip here and see how it sounds there. So I think for this end section, I would drop this into another track because it just sounds different than up until this point. So I'm going to make a cut and drop it in a new track. So I'm going to make a cut on this and just drop it down into its own track down here. So let's continue working on this track and let's just give it a listen and see if we want to add in some more effects. So one thing that I don't like about how it's sounding so far is how the expander is kind of making it, you know, the volume kind of come up and down a little bit. I don't like that too much, but, you know, there's not going to be a whole ton that we could do about it. We could, you know, bring it back a little bit so it's not, you know, applying as much of the expander. So let's just leave it there. So let's go ahead and add in a multi-band compressor here. So I'm going to hit the plus icon here under my effects, come down to dynamics, Fairlight effects and multi-band compressor. So we're just going to try the default settings and see what it sounds like. So now you can see we're getting more consistently around that minus 10 dB. I'm liking this. I think it helps a little bit. It helps it sound a little bit better. So I'm going to stick with that. So one thing we notice if I turn off the noise reduction tool here, it sounds like it kind of helps with how that's kind of ducking down too much or what I'm considering too much in between the words and phrases. So let's just give that a listen. So I might do that. I might just actually drop down the wet dry mix on the noise reduction tool. So you can use that in the free version. You adjust it to how you think sounds good. I'm going to do what I think sounds pretty good here. But I can tell you that the voice isolation is going to do a much better job with that. So let's just give that a try. I'm going to turn off this noise reduction. We're going to come to my track. I'm going to select it by selecting over here. And I'm just going to come and turn on voice isolation. I can do it right here or you can open your inspector. As long as your track is selected, you're going to see it over here. We're going to turn that on. Now we don't need to use 100% voice isolation. So what I'm going to do is click this little icon here. I'm going to pop it out. And I'm actually going to start with it at zero and I'll just raise it up a little bit. I'm thinking we're going to need maybe 10-15%. I don't know. Let's give it a listen. All right. So I think that's pretty good. We actually ended up going about 30% there. Now one of the things that I noticed that voice isolation takes care of that the noise reduction was not taken care of is like a hum from the camera. There's like a hum noise in there that I kept hearing. That's pretty annoying. The voice isolation is going to take care of that. So if you've got studio nine times out of 10, 9.9 times out of 10, if I'm being honest, the voice isolation is going to do a better job for you to take care of any kind of background noise underneath dialogue. It doesn't matter what it is over any of the other built-in tools in Resolve here. And even if I come in my dynamics, let's just go ahead and turn off the expander. So you can hear, let's see what that sounds like. So it even does a good job there. I'm just going to go back and leave on that expander just to have it on. Let's go ahead and close out the voice isolation. So I think that's good on how I would edit that first track of audio. Now let's jump into the second track of audio. But before we do, you want to know why I got this bandaid on my head? Well, here's a little video of what happened. Yeah, so I was trying to hack out some roots and one popped up hit me right between the eyes, split it wide open, had to go to the ER, get a few stitches in there, put my head back together. I think we're going to be good to go. I get stitches out on Friday. So that is why I've got the bandaid on my head there. Thankfully, I'm all right. Not a big deal. I'm still able to make videos for you guys. All right. Track number two, let's go. So on our next track here, let's take a quick little listen here and see what we've got. Okay, so we've got the same issues here, kind of as we did in the first track. It just sounds a little bit different. So if we wanted to try our settings from the first track and see what it sounds like here, and then just make some fine tune adjustments, we can do that. We can come up to our track right here. I'm going to right click, and I'm going to come down and say copy attributes, come down to my second track here, right click, and I'm going to say paste attributes. I'll get this window here, and I'm just going to paste everything onto this track. I'm going to say apply and boom, there we go. Now it didn't reduce the volume of this track for me at all, like in the inspector here. It's still at zero, right? Whereas this one up here, we drop, drop down a little bit to 7.5. So I think I would lower the volume of this just a little bit because it does look like it's getting a little, you know, close to peek in there, maybe. So let's just lower it down a little bit like that, play through it, see where it comes in when we compare it to the meters down here and our other track. Turbulent wings with different sauces. All right, so I can raise it back up a little bit. Let's try putting it back at zero dB at its original volume there. See what that sounds like. Five different types of sauces. I'll leave the link, you can see. Here's everything in the flour. I'll put the frying pan. All right, so a couple of things. I think this is just like a bunch of clips that are put together and there's some dead space in between them, which is why it sounds a little more choppy than, you know, it might otherwise. I don't know if they use music under it or if they do anything else. But let me come up here. I want to actually reduce the voice isolation a little bit. I think it's a little much because I want to hear a little bit of what's going on in the background. So I'm going to lower that to, I don't know, 18. See how that sounds. Listen. Let it warm up. Pour vegetable oil. All right, not too bad. Let's leave that there for now. Let's do a little check of our EQ. So I am going to open that up, double click the EQ. Let's hear what we've got here and see how it sounds before and after. There's a very tasty recipe. Chicken wings with different sauces. Five different types of sauces. All right, I think that sounds, that sounds okay for me. Now let's go to our dynamics panel here and we want to just make sure that we've got a good balance for all of the audio because as we notice, we've got some that are quieter, some sections that are quieter, some sections that are a little bit louder with the taller peaks in here, looking at our waveforms on the clip itself. So let me try just turning off the expander and we're going to work with the compressor a little bit. I turn on the pan. I turn on the stove and let it warm up. Pour vegetable oil. A little bit. Try another section here. I've already put the chicken wings in and let them fry and then I'll turn them over. The water is boiling here too. I'll be putting the spaghetti in soon. The water is boiling here too. I pour the rice. I wash the rice. I mix it like this once. And I cover it with a lid. The salt is already there. I didn't take the net off on purpose, but I want to cook it on purpose. I want to cook it. Garnish is filled with delicious ingredients. That's all for today. I offered you an idea of an easy lunch. I'm going to put the compressor a little above and below in the neighborhood of the minus 10 dB on our output here. For both the louder parts and the quieter parts. That's what the dynamics are going to do for us between the compressor and the makeup slider there. We're reducing the dynamic range of our audio a little bit. I'm going to close that down. I think our audio is in a good spot for right now. I'm pretty happy with it. Remember, it's not going to be perfect. It's not going to sound awesome and super great as if your external recorder was working and you had your microphone right there. Because it's just recorded internally on the camera, we're just trying to make the best out of what we've got. The last thing I would do with this audio is I would go ahead and make sure it's going to meet the loudness levels for YouTube. You would do this after you have any music or anything else you might add into your video when it comes to audio. You would do it at that point, but let me just show you how I would do that. In fair light, right here, I'm going to come up to my meters section. If you don't see your meters, click on this guy. We want to come to our loudness. I'm going to click the three dots, come down to YouTube. I'm going to zoom my entire timeline by using Shift Z. And we're going to make sure we've got this icon turned on because once that's turned on, we can see our bus one down here. Make sure our loudness history is on. And then we see the minus 14 loves for the loudness level here, which is the maximum allowable by YouTube. So we want our plotted line that comes in down here to be close to, but not going over that minus 14 loves. So there's a few different ways that we can, you know, work with our track and change things around. In this case, let's just throw an effect on our bus to make sure we can get close to but not go over that minus 14 levels. So let's go ahead and click on our plus. We're going to come down to dynamics, fair light effects, and we're going to go with a soft clipper. So you can see up in here, it's kind of like a little bit of a compressor, right? And it's just making sure we don't clip and peak. So it's just going to grab the little bit right at the end if we get too close and just bring it down a little bit. So I'll adjust it a little bit like that. And we can always adjust our output level right here. So if we need to make everything as a whole louder, we can use dial right here. You could also always use your fader in the main bus there. If you wanted to either ways perfectly fine. It does the same thing. So let's go ahead and listen through, see where that line is falling. And then we'll go ahead and make any changes we need to. So as I'm watching my line here, it's kind of coming up and getting balanced around that minus 16 loves level or so. If I close out the soft clipper here, we can see our integrated level right here is at minus 16.3. And I think that's okay. Typically I aim to get mine around at minus 16 because I don't want to get too close to minus 14. So I'm happy with that. You could make it a little bit louder if you wanted. I did boost the audio track right here a little bit. And actually I would just boost them all the same amount because they're all the dialogue track there. But if we had other things like music or sound effects or other types of audio things in our timeline here, then you know, it would change things a bunch, right? We would look a little bit different here down on our loudness graph because it would be kind of adding in everything all together and looking at all of the audio as a whole. And in this case, we just have dialogue. So I mean, in theory, we could have set our track a little bit different. But the way that I mentioned to set it up with the minus 10 dB for your levels, I like to go with that because if you have other things in your video, it just makes it in a better spot for your dialogue to be around that minus 10 dB. As we start to mix everything together, check the loudness levels and make sure that nothing's peaking, nothing's clipping, and that we're in a good spot for YouTube. Here's a quick before and after of a little segment. Before we did any edits and after we did the edits, what do you guys think? I want to hear your comments below. A big thank you to Miri's channel for sending me some audio to take a look at and share with you guys on how I would go through this real world audio edit. If you guys are into cooking and you know how to speak their language or you don't mind watching the subtitles because I checked out some of their videos with subtitles, head on over to Miri's channel, link down below. You can check it out and just kind of see what they've got going on on their channel there. But I'm always happy to help you guys out if I can with some real world audio edits and just kind of do what I can to make your audio sound the best. And in this case, thankfully they recorded audio internally on the camera. Is it the best? No. But we were able to make it sound a little bit better than it would be otherwise and at least they still got some audio, right? That's why it's important to record audio in multiple spots. I do. On my camera, I've got a mic up here. Record it in a few spots just in case something happens. You know, sometimes mics stop working, cameras stop working, recorders don't work. And it's always nice to have that extra backup that we can just make it the best we can. So that way, you know, all your hard work doesn't go to waste. So if you have questions on anything that we did here or questions about your own audio, drop me a comment and let me know. And if you want me to edit your audio, let me know that too because I could probably do that, make a video about it and share it with everybody else. Alright, with that said, I am out of here. Thank you guys so much and I will see you in the next video. Hopefully with no stitches. See ya! Peace!
