If you are brand new to DaVinci Resolve 20 and you want to edit your first project, this is the crash course for you. I'm Jason Yadlowski, I make videos here on YouTube teaching people how to work in DaVinci Resolve, especially beginners, because it can feel really overwhelming and a little scary when you first get started in Resolve. I know it was for me. So in this video we're going to walk through some of the basic things you need to know to start creating your first video here in DaVinci Resolve, from importing your clips to editing, to adding some basic effects, all the way up to exporting out your first project. And by the end of this video, you should be feeling comfortable that you can at least get in there, create a basic project and then get it exported out to DaVinci Resolve. I'm going to try and keep this kind of short and sweet. So let's jump in and resolve. Once you get Resolve installed and you open it up, you should see this window, which is your project manager window. Now it may look like this or you might see this where it has your databases over here. Don't worry about all this stuff too much. What we want to do is come on down to new projects. Click on that. Now when you do that, you can go ahead and give your project a name. And then what you want to do is actually pick the location on your hard drive, where your project's being stored. So I'm going to hit change location. And I'm just going to pick the top level folder I want and choose open. Then you can go ahead and click create. Now I'm going to assume you're in the free version of DaVinci Resolve because well, it's free. So let's take a look at what we have here. DaVinci Resolve gives you everything you need to create a video from start to finish. So we've got different tabs or different pages here in Resolve, starting with our media page right here. We can do a lot of different things with media. We've got our cut page right here, which is for faster editing. We've got our edit page, which is where I recommend doing all of your editing. We have our fusion page, which is for VFX and cool things like that. We've got our color page here for color grading. We have the Fairlight page for in-depth audio work. And we have the deliver page right here to help us export our projects out of DaVinci Resolve. That's the basic layout of all the different parts of Resolve. So let's jump into the edit tab here because that's where I'm going to recommend that you do your work. It's probably going to be a little familiar to you if you've worked in an NLE before. And the reality is I find most of the time I would end up in the edit tab anyway. So I don't use the cut tab right here too much. I just get started right in the edit tab. Now, before we get started bringing some media into our project, I want to make sure you guys are looking at the same thing that I am. So come on up to workspace and come down to reset UI layout. And that's going to make sure that your layout of your screen looks just like mine. So that way we can follow along with each other easily. So I am currently in the edit tab right here. And we want to bring in some footage. I'm going to provide a link down below where you can get some free footage that I have. You can play with it, try things out. But it's free footage just in case you don't have anything to work with right from the start. And the easiest way to set all of your project settings right from the start is to click on one of your files, bring it over and drag and drop it into the media pool right here. And once I do that, Resolve is going to recognize, hey, your clip frame rate might not match the project. Do you want to match them? I'm going to say, yeah, I'm going to say change. So now my project settings should match with that clip I just brought in. And I know the rest of my clips in this case are the same. So I'm just going to click hold and drag and drop them right in the media pool right here. If you want to keep your footage organized, you can add some more bins over here by right clicking on master. You can say new bin and you can add as many bins as you want, move your footage around, organize it however you want. But all of your footage, your audio, your sound effects, anything is going to live right here in the media pool. And you can open and close your media pool or any of these other items along the top of the screen by just clicking on it. Now we currently don't have a timeline in our project, but if we want to create one, there's a few ways to do it. You can right click and say timeline, create new timeline, or you can just select a clip, drag it down into this area and drop it in and it's going to create the timeline for you. Now just taking a look at the Resolve window on the right hand side here, we have our timeline view. So anything we put in our timeline, this is our viewer for that. And the viewer on the left is anything that's in our media pool that we might select that we want to take a look at. And then we can scrub back and forth. If we double click, it stays in our viewer right here, we can move back and forth and either use the whole clip or we can use some in and out points and select whatever part of the clip we might want. So for example, maybe I just want a little section of this, I can come to wherever I want, I can press the I key to set an in point and then go to wherever I want it to end, select O or press O, set an out point, and then I can drag and drop it in the timeline. Now when I hover over the clip, you notice we have a video and an audio section. So if you only wanted either video or only audio, you could just grab that part and drag it down. For example, audio only, it'll bring only the audio. I want both. So I'm just going to click up here above all those symbols and drag and drop it in my timeline. Now if you forget the I and the O for the in and out points, you've got these two buttons right here. Those are your in and out markers. So it does the same thing for you. Now let's talk some basic tools and navigation around the timeline. Now I like to use my middle mouse wheel to scroll up and down when I've got multiple tracks in my timeline. If you need to add a new track, you can come over here, right click, add a new track down here in the audio, right click, add a new track, and you can add as many tracks as you need. Now if we wanted to start working with our clips, we want to make some cuts. What I can do is zoom in a little bit and we can either use these tools right here and click zoom in or you can use command plus and minus to zoom in or zoom out on your timeline. Either way works just fine and they do the same thing. So let's say I want to make a cut right here because I don't need this part, right? We can see we have no audio waveforms. I just want to make a cut right here. So to do that, we're going to use the blade tool right here. The default keyboard shortcut is B. I actually remapped mine to S, but you can hit the letter B and it should work the same for you. So if I hit S, it's going to make a cut and you can see now we've got a cut right there. We can select our clip and if we use the backspace key, it's going to delete that clip but leave a space in our timeline. However, if we were to select the clip and use the delete key or delete forward key, if you have one or you might need to use, you know, like a function key plus the backspace key, it'll ripple delete. So it'll delete this clip and then push everything over like this. Now, if you want to take it even one step further, if I undo all that, let's say I want to make a cut, delete that clip and push everything over all at once. I can do that. And if you want to see what that keyboard shortcut is, come on up to the trim menu down to ripple and we have start to play head and end to play head. So that's telling you which way it's going to make a cut and delete and push everything over. So I remapped mine from to Q and W. Yours will be different here. You'll see what they are and you can use those or you can remap them like I did. So in this case, if I hit my Q key, it's going to make a cut, select that portion of the clip and then delete it and move everything over. Check it out. Super quick and easy. So when you're trying to make cuts quick and easy, you can do it really fast. If I come ahead, I'm going to hit my cut key, my blade key, and then I'm going to come here. Let's say I want to take this little section out, my Q key, move ahead, make another cut. And then let's say I want to delete everything from here to the end. I can use my W key. It's going to do that. Delete everything for me. Really quick and easy to just make cuts and delete things. You can also select the blade tool here, move it around on your timeline, make your cuts. Then you can always select a clip, hit the backspace key to leave a gap. If you want to get rid of the gap, you can select the clip, hit the delete key, and it'll delete the gap. If you want to delete a gap that's already there, you can select it like this and use your backspace key, and it'll delete the gap like that. Now, if you want to make sure that you can snap to different points on your timeline, you want to make sure you've got your snapping turned on, and you also want to make sure that this one stays on, link selection, because that's going to make sure that your audio and your video clips stay linked together. For example, if I turn that off, notice I can move my video clip separate from my audio clip, but it tells me, hey, they're off by four seconds and 11 frames. So you don't want to do that. You want to make sure that you turn that back on, make sure that's highlighted. You'll see the link icon on both of these, and then you'll know that they're linked back together. Now, let's say maybe you want to change something about the clip, the size, something like that. You can select your clip, and we're going to make all those kind of changes right here in the inspector. We can zoom in, zoom out, we can move it left and right with the position, we can rotate it, you can change the pitch and the yaw. Those are all your transform tools. So if I want to reset these actions, I'm just going to hit the little circle here. Let's say maybe I want to crop it. I'm going to click on the cropping. I can bring in the right, the left, top, bottom, whatever you want to do. Dynamic zoom is nice. It's going to give you a nice, slow zoom for you automatically, without you really having to do anything. You've got your composite modes. If you're putting things on top of each other, how do you want them to react? Kind of like Photoshop, if you've ever been in there, you've got add color, all these different things of different ways that it adds clips on top of another. Your opacity here will reduce or make your clip invisible so you can't see it. You can change the speed of your clip right here. You can also stabilize your clip. We have lens corrections if you needed those. We also have retime and scaling that helps smooth out your footage for you if you need it. And those are the basic tools that you're going to need on all of your clips. You're going to use something from the inspector here, the most of the time when you're going to need to make some kind of change. And if you ever want to reset anything, you can just click on these little circles here. That's going to reset everything for you for that particular tool. If you wanted to adjust some audio, you can come into the audio section here. Got your volume right here, your pan, couple tools here. Some of these are in studio only, so you may not see them in your version. Or if you do, it may not allow you to use them. Got your EQ. And you can make any audio changes you need right there. So those are the super basics of just getting some clips in there and starting to work with them right here in DaVinci Resolve. Now, just as important as video is, I think that audio may even be more important than your video. I'm an audio guy, lots of videos here on YouTube teaching you all about audio and how it all works. I even have a course that teaches you everything you need to know about audio. So link below, you can check that out if you're interested. But some audio basics right here. First things first, we want to make sure we've got good audio levels. We could do it right here in the edit page. We don't even need to jump into the audio page, which is Fairlight. Don't even have to jump over there. We can do it right in the edit tab. First thing I want to do, I'm going to close my inspector and I'm going to open up my mixer, because this is going to allow me to see my meters. That's going to help me decide where to set my audio levels. So let me play through this clip right here. We're going to watch our meters and we want our dialogue to be around minus 10 dB right here. What's happening guys? Giving you a little free footage here to practice with. You can work with. All right, it's a little loud. So there's a few ways that we can make it a little quieter. I want to zoom in on my timeline a little bit. You can hold your shift key and middle mouse wheel to make it bigger or come to your timeline view options right here. You can adjust your audio and video track heights, as well as turn on things like waveforms and change the way it looks and stuff like that. So on our clip right here, you should see this little white line and get this symbol. You can click hold and drag it down to make it quieter or drag it up to make it louder. So in this case, I'm going to drag it down a couple dB there. Let's try about four. See where it falls on our meter. Hopefully around that minus 10. A little free footage here to practice with. You work with the audio work with the all right. A little low. Bring it back up a little bit. All right. I think that's pretty good. So that's how you can set your audio levels really quick. And that's super important, making sure that we've got good audio levels to start with. Now let's say maybe you want to fade an audio clip in or out, especially if it's a sound effect or maybe even some music. So I can come to my audio clip here and as long as it's a decent height here, if it's too small like this, you're not going to see it. But if you make it a little bit bigger, eventually you'll see this little tab in the corner, you just click hold and drag that in and that's going to fade in your audio. And it's as easy as that. Now without getting too in the weeds, if you want to make some EQ adjustments, one of the most powerful audio tools, it's in the free versions in studio, you can come to your mixer and just click on the EQ right here, double click. It'll bring this up. You can make a few quick changes. Here's some tips on how to make that dialogue sound good. We're going to turn on band one, bring it up to say about 120 ish. And I'm just going to grab my other points and listen for things that don't sound good. Could do it real quick. And I've got more info on all this stuff if you're interested. But here's how we do it. A lot more advanced sets of clips that you guys can purchase and download here on my Shopify. So what we're going to do real quick is just show you how to take the battery out of my John Deere tractor. So let's go and do that real quick. What's happening guys, giving you a little free footage here to practice with. You work with the audio work with the video. This is just a quick couple clips here, freebies for you guys. I do have a lot more advanced sets of clips that you guys can purchase and download here on my Shopify. So what we're going to do real quick is just show you how to take the battery out of my John Deere tractor. So let's go and do that real quick. What's happening guys, giving you a little free footage here to practice with. All right, there's a little EQ for you, little before and after. Here's what that sounds like. There are advanced sets of clips that you guys can purchase and download here on my Shopify. So what we're going to do real quick. All right, I think that does pretty good. I've got lots of videos on EQ and how to do it, what it all means and all that stuff. But it's there. You can get it from the edit page really quick and really easily and make that audio sound amazing. And if you needed any simple audio effects or maybe some video effects, again, right here in the edit tab, super easy. I'm going to close my media pool. I'm going to open up my effects library. And we've got a lot of different things going on in here. You may need to click on the little drop down here to open up the different things. But let's say you wanted some audio effects. We've got Fairlight effects. Maybe you wanted a dialogue processor. All I have to do is click, hold and drag and drop it on the clip for it to be active on the clip itself or drop it right over here for it to be active on the entire track. So I'm going to drop it right here for the whole track. It's going to pop up the window for you. There's some presets in here. You can give those a try and see how it sounds. Here's a little before and after free footage here to practice with. You work with the audio work with the video. This is just a maybe you want some video effects on your video so we can come to resolve FX. You can pick whatever you might want. Let's say maybe I want some camera shake. I'm just going to drag and drop that on the clip. And with the video ones here, you can't drop it on the track itself. It goes on the clip. If I play through it, we're going to watch our viewer right up here on the right. Right, it's got a little bounce to it. Looks like I'm walking. Now we can change any one of the effects that we apply to a clip or a track by selecting the clip, opening up our inspector and looking under the effects tab right here. So you can see we have camera shake. So I could crank this up and make it way crazy. And if you don't like your changes, you can always reset things. You've got keyframes here, a lot of advanced stuff that you can do. But the basics are that you can jump into the inspector here and make any change that you want. If you want to change your audio effect, because I applied it on the whole track, I want to select the track. So I'm going to click over in this area on my timeline or right up here, we have a clip or a track that you can select. So that audio effect is on a track. So I'm going to click that again, our effects, and we've got all of our settings here. Doesn't look as nice as that little pop out window. But if you click on this little icon right here, pops out the window, you can go ahead and make any changes that you want. Now if you really want to make your audio sound good, I do have an audio essentials for video editors in DaVinci Resolve Audio Course, give you all the basics. We work through a documentary together, and you're going to learn everything you need to know about making that audio sound. Mwah, sweet chef's kiss. Now let's talk about another subject that everybody loves, transition. In our effects library that we already have open here, we've got video transitions. And there's a ton of great transitions here in DaVinci Resolve. And all you have to do is click on the one that you want, hold and drag it over and drop it onto your timeline. Now you might notice, hey, wait, what's going on? It's only going on one side. It's not going on both sides. Now there's a reason for that. It is because we're either at the very end of a clip, which you can see this clip has no more handles after it, right? I can make it shorter, but I can't make it any longer. Or we're at the very beginning of a clip. Now the clip on the right hand side of my playhead here, we've got space under there. There's handles under there. And Resolve needs a little bit of handles on both sides in order to drop on that transition. Now it will drop on just one side, but if you want it to cover both clips, we need to make this one on the left a little bit shorter by just a few frames. All right. And now I know I've got plenty on this side, so I can adjust that a little bit. Now I should be able to drop on the drop warp here. And it should be good to go. There you go. So if you're not able to drop a transition on there, make sure you shorten the clip by just a few frames, maybe three or four frames, which hopefully shouldn't make a big difference for you. And then you should be able to drop on those transitions. If you want to add an audio transition, the next little category here in our effects library is audio transitions. You can same thing, click, hold, and drag, drop it right down onto your audio clip. And then you've got a crossfade on there. And then you're going to be good to go. Crossfade, done. You can move on to your next step. So you can pretty much use the things we discussed in this video already to go ahead and edit together your first video. You're basically just making cuts, deleting parts, moving clips around, maybe adding a little effect here or there. And you should be able to edit together your video. And one problem you might be having is that your playback is a little slow, a little choppy, it's lagging a little bit. Here's a couple tips on how to make that better. So I'm going to go ahead and close my effects library. I'm also going to close my mixer, get that out of the way. You can come up to your playback menu down to timeline playback resolution. And you can change this from full to half or quarter. So that's going to make the resolution of your clip in the viewer look a little less sharp and clear, but it's going to render out just fine. It's really just a playback thing to help it play back a little bit easier on your machine for you. So a lot of times I'll use half and you don't even notice the difference. The other thing you can do is again come back to the playback menu, come down to render cash and choose smart. And that's going to tell DaVinci Resolve, Hey, after five seconds by default of me not doing anything, start to render out these clips and just process them in the background. So then when I play through my timeline, everything plays a whole lot smoother. It's not trying to do a render in real time. Now it's not creating, you know, tons of extra files and actually rendering all these things out of Resolve. It's just creating cash files where it can use those to play back a lot smoother in your timeline. So typically I'm going to use smart. And when you turn that on, you're going to see on things like transitions, you'll have a little line here that'll be red and then it'll turn into blue once that's kind of rendered in the background. And that's going to allow you to just play through your timeline a lot quicker without stuttering or jittery playback or anything like that. Now what if you need to change the color on some of these clips, you need to do a little color grading or a little correction. Well to do that, we're actually going to jump over into the color tab. Don't be too scared. Going to give you a few quick tips here to get you going and at least get you started adjusting some colors in your clips. So you want to click on the color tab right here. Now hearing the color tab, it may look a little intimidating, but don't be scared. Here's what we've got. We've got our viewer up here that shows us our clip that we're working on. We've got our clips down here that we can choose to work with. Each one of our clip has a node on it. It's going to start by default with one node, but you can add in as many as you want. Typically you kind of want to make changes on individual nodes just so you can go back and make adjustments. But for simplicity's sake here, I'm just going to use one node. And then I'm going to come down to my bottom section here. And these are going to be all the different tools that you've got available to you. Just to be simple and keep it easy. You're going to want to come to the color wheel section. And you want to start working with your offset, gain, gamma, and lift. Now offset is like your overall exposure for the image there. You can reset it by always clicking on any of these little reset buttons anywhere throughout resolve. Gain is going to be your highlights or the brighter areas of your image. Gamma is going to be your mid tones and lift is going to be your darks or your shadows. Now how do I know where I'm supposed to put those? Well, I like to open up the scopes right over here. And without getting too complicated, the white parts at the top, the dark parts are at the bottom and mid tones are in the middle. Makes sense, right? So if I were to just adjust these a little bit, I know my sky's going to be blown out. And that's why it's a hard line at the top there. That's all right. So I can just make some adjustments here. We do have our contrast right here. You've got your temperature for your white balance. If you wanted to select something on your screen, you can click the little dropper, pick something where you want to match the white balance. I don't know if that was great. Let's try a different spot maybe. Let's just say I like that. I think that's good. You can adjust your color, your saturation, things like that, your shadows and highlights. You could just go through play with these things and make the changes that you want. If you want to see a quick before and after, just click on the number there. It's going to show you a little before and after, or if you want to bypass all the settings for color grades and fusion effects, which are things like transitions and things like that, you can click on this and it's going to bypass all that stuff. So you can see a quick before and after. Now I know this is real quick, but it's given you a good basic understanding of the venture resolve. Let's jump into the deliver tab so we can figure out how to export out our project. So deliver tab is the rocket ship down at the bottom here. Now in the deliver tab here, we do have a whole bunch of presets that we can use right along the top here. You can select the YouTube preset if you want or any of these other options that might work for you. So if you want to use any of the presets, you can just go ahead and click on those. I want to show you a custom preset that I use. So for example, I have a 1080 export for YouTube. So I'm going to click on that. And here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to come into the file name, I can name it whatever I want called the venture resolve crash course, I'm going to browse to wherever I want to put it on my hard drive. Then I'm going to choose single clip because I want it all rendered out as a full video altogether. Format is going to be an MP4 codec is h.264 because there was no 265 when I made this preset, but we can change it to h.265. I'm going to use hardware acceleration if possible resolution, I'm going to use the timeline resolution, which is 1920 by 1080 in this case, frame rate is going to match my timeline. And then under quality, I like to restrict it to 40,000. I find you do not get good results if you use the automatic. And then in coding profile, I'm going to go main 10, and I like to do a multi-pass just so it goes through there twice. Doesn't make a difference, do you have to? I don't know, but I always do it anyway. You've got some advanced settings down here if you need them. Most of the time, I don't use any of these. I don't need to enable or change anything here. You've got subtitle settings where if you want to export your subtitles, you can click on export subtitle, you can do it as a separate file, embed it or just burn it right into the video. It's up to you depending on what you need. And then if you're uploading to YouTube, you've got some YouTube settings here, where you can upload it directly to YouTube if you wanted to. And once you've got all the settings that you want set, you can come to your timeline and either set some in and out points if you wanted, or it's going to do the entire timeline kind of by default. So you can see right here, it says render entire timeline, I'm going to say in and out range. So let's say I only wanted to hear, I'm going to press O to change my out points. And then once I'm happy with the part of my timeline I have selected, I've done all my editing, everything's all done. I've set my settings here in the deliver tab, I'm going to click add to render queue. And that's going to pop it up over in here. It's always going to stay there unless you delete it. So that way, if you want to render out the video again with the same settings, all you have to do is select it right here and go ahead and hit render all. And that's going to render out your video from DaVinci Resolve and put it wherever you select it on your hard drive. All right, so that is a really quick overview to getting started in DaVinci Resolve, real high level, just the basic, basic things you need to know to get in there and start working with some video. I do plan on making a much more in depth crash course here on DaVinci Resolve 20, a lot more nitty gritty in the details of different things that you might want to do in tools and what all the knobs buttons and dials do. I'm going to be working on that for you. So stay tuned for that. But I do have one in version 19, which is going to be essentially the same as version 20, 20 has just got some extra tools in there. So you can check that out on my channel. If you want, grab those free files. If you have questions, be sure to leave a comment down below. I'm pretty good at getting back to you guys. Because my goal here is to just help you guys learn DaVinci Resolve better. I want you guys to make awesome stuff. I want you to be able to get through it without getting frustrated like I did when I first got started. I was like, er, pulling my hair out, you know, see, I got none, right? And it's, it's challenging when you first get started, but you got this use these tips in this video. And I've got tons of other videos when you come up with questions, just look around my channel or some of our other great creator friends out there like Casey and Alex and just there's a whole bunch of them. They're all great. They make great tutorials. So if I don't have what you're looking for, I can certainly point you in the right direction. And if you do want to learn audio, I do have a full audio crash course. I'll link that below too. Audio essentials for video editors in DaVinci Resolve. I'm going to teach you all the things you need to know about audio from levels to editing to EQ to effects, how to make it sound awesome. And we work through a mini documentary in there. You can get all the files that comes with the course, tons of great stuff there, works really hard on it. And I think it's, I think it's good and it really teaches you guys on everything that you need to know about audio. So with that said, thank you so much for tuning in. Stay tuned for that longer crash course. And I will see you in the next video. Peace.
