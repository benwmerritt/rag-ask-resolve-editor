What's happening guys welcome to this video today. We're jumping in a fusion. I know I know don't worry about it We're not getting too complicated here You can totally do this but we're gonna be talking about how you can outline things in a basic fashion kind of like this We got the resolve logo over here. You got a little circle around it's highlighted Okay, not too bad, but I'm also gonna show you how you can take this circle make it a little more fancy and animate it kind of like this Not too bad right kind of cool. So those are very basic, but let's say you know Maybe I wanted to highlight my shirt here, right? We got cat everybody loves a good caterpillar good big machine, right? Who doesn't man? I wish I could go drive one of those machines. Let's do some awesome But anyway, we can highlight like that and I'm gonna show you how we can do that And then we're gonna get into something that's a little more complicated You need to use a little bit of tracking But we're still gonna create that outline and have that glowing effect and we can even animate it too It's gonna look a little something like this This is a great tip I use it when I'm trying to highlight things in my videos and stuff sometimes so with that said let's jump into resolve We're gonna check this out. I'm gonna show you how to do it from basic to a little more advanced I'll put some timestamps in the video so you can jump to the part that you're interested in or come back to it If you forget how to do it. So here we come fusion. We're jumping in and we're gonna animate some outlines Hoho full stop if you are new here, my name is Jay or Jason Yadlowski It doesn't really matter which one but we make weekly DaVinci resolve tutorials So if you're into that consider subscribing to my channel. So I am in the edit tab right here I got my timeline set up with how I want it I do have my resolve logo right where I want to put it for the first static outline that we're gonna create I want to resize this guy. So I'm just gonna open my inspector Scale this guy down and actually the way I like to scale stuff a lot of times Just click this little icon right here, and then you can just size it however you want So I'll bring this guy over here. That's pretty good. Let's shrink it down a little more Let's go with like that. So I know I want to put a circle around it So how do we do that? Well, we do need to jump in the fusion and for this example because I have an image That's a smaller size here I actually want to make this into a fusion composition first if you were just using your clip That's the same size as your timeline You could just jump right into fusion which I'll show you how to do that in a minute here on the one where I outlined The catcher so what I want to do is just come to my DaVinci resolve logo I'm gonna right click and say new Fusion clip and now what that's gonna do is create a fusion clip That's the same size as my video clips in my timeline here So have your clip selected and we're gonna jump on over into fusion right here All right, so we're in fusion a quick tip right here If you hold your command or control key and your middle mouse wheel you can zoom in it in and out That might come in handy for you So the first thing we need to do is I'm gonna select my median one which is my input video You want to make sure you're at the very beginning of your Frame or of your clip here. So right here. I'm at the beginning and for this one. It's pretty easy We want to come and hit a background node That's gonna add in our background right here as well as a merge node if you have your input selected your median one selected It'll add a merge node for you got my background node and Next we need something to draw that shape with so I'm gonna use this guy right here the ellipse So if I have my background node selected and I select my ellipse It's gonna attach it up and push everything a little out of whack there All right, so reorganized the ellipse is connected to the background node Which is connected to the merge node. We're good and you can notice up on the screen here We do have our ellipse or our circle in this case and that's looking pretty good so far But you notice that it's black so we need to adjust some settings here So it looks the way we want so with your ellipse selected come on over to your inspector and right here We have solid you want to go ahead and uncheck that now That's gonna turn off the fill for the shape The next thing I want to do is come to border width right here and I want to increase that now You can just hit this and grab it and slide it like this if you want a more fine-tuned adjustment You can hover over the number here click hold and you can drag it back and forth So I'm just gonna pick something like that for now And now I want to resize this and put it on top of my DaVinci Resolve logo So I'm just gonna come over into the image into the viewer here. I can grab it and just shrink it down I can grab my center point and just bring it over top of my DaVinci Resolve logo Gonna zoom in a little bit and that looks pretty good Let's say I want to make that a little bit of a softer edge, right? I don't want to be so so harsh there I can come on over to soft edge right here and it's basically gonna fade that edge a little bit So you can make it however you want. I'm gonna pick something like that looks pretty good So now we want to change the color of this outline, right? I want it to be more of an orangey kind of color So to do that come on over to our background node click on that and up here in our inspector. Here's our color I'm just gonna click on that. It's gonna bring up my color wheel I'm gonna drop this all the way down to white so I can see all my colors and let's say I just want to choose an orange That's something kind of like that gonna hit okay And now you can see our shape or our highlight is the color that we selected the shape that we selected Which is the ellipse and it's kind of faded in and out So that's the basics of how you're gonna just create a basic static outline on your image or on your clip here So let's jump back into the edit tab real quick And I'm gonna just grab the handles here and fade this clip in and I'll fade it out and This is what that looks like the fashion kind of like this. We got the resolve logo over here You got a little circle around it's highlighted. Okay, not too bad. Maybe all right. So that works out pretty good So in the next example, we're gonna see how we can animate that circle So I have my next clip right here and what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna just start with the first clip I created because you would do the exact same steps as we just did in order to get started animating this shape So I'm actually gonna delete this logo here I'm gonna select my clip and I'm gonna copy that over right to where I put my little marker here And now we should be good to go. I'm gonna select my clip. We want to jump back into fusion So if you have something highlighted and you want it to stay stationary, but you want to animate it, right? I want that circle to spin as it comes in. This is how you're gonna do it You're gonna follow all the same steps. We just did you're gonna add your background node with a merge You're gonna add your ellipse and by the way, you can use these other tools here depending on the shape If you want something different than the ellipse you want to you want to square you can use that or a rectangle If you want to draw a custom shape, you can use the polygon or the B spline and just put those where this ellipse is It doesn't matter. They'll all work the same way They have the same tools where you can adjust the border width and make it not a solid So you're gonna see that more as we move forward here But just want to let you guys know whatever shape you want to do you can do it Don't worry about just using a circle But in each one of these tools here that we just talked about regardless of which one you use You're gonna want to select it come back to the inspector and we want to take a look at the position and length section So we're gonna have to add some keyframes in here and don't get too worried It's pretty straightforward and pretty easy. So I'm gonna come to the first frame in my Clip here So make sure you're at your first frame and I'm gonna go ahead and set keyframes for the position as well as the Length now the length I want to drag that all the way down to zero because I want it to get longer as The clip goes on the position is gonna help me determine how many times is it gonna rotate around the circle? So if I just grab the position and I pull it you can see it swings around and notice it stops at one one rotation there Well, we can just punch in any number here that we want it doesn't have to stay at one So let's just back this down We're gonna set our keyframes here at zero and zero for both the position and the length now I'm gonna come ahead you pick however many frames you want how long do you want to animate it? I'm just gonna hit the spacebar here. See what looks good So for me, I'm gonna say 50 frame sounds good about two seconds because I'm at 23 point nine seven six frames per second for my timeline So now I'm gonna come in here. I'm gonna take my length and I'm gonna boost that all the way up to one For the position I want to change this and this is where you've got some leeway You can pick as many rotations as you want Let's say I want to do out of four rotations and I'm just gonna click outside of these boxes Now let's go back to the beginning and see what that looks like So there we go that looks pretty good, it's got a nice little animation there it rotates in I like that now Let's say that's cool. Now. I wanted to animate out as well So just come to the frame where you want to start the animation out. I'm gonna say I don't know let's start on 80 I'm gonna come back to my inspector again Make sure you have your ellipse selected or whichever one of these tools you used right here Make sure you've got it selected come to the position and the length and you want to click the keyframe button to add another keyframe Then I'm gonna go ahead to the end of the clip and I'm just gonna drag the length to zero and Position back to zero so now when we play through our clip we should see it animate on it'll stay consistent stay a steady solid circle And then it'll animate it off. Let's check it out Good animates on and then hits that keyframe and animates off And it's just looping here, so if I turn off the loop here it should stop at the end There you go So that's the basics of how you would animate a very basic outline here in div entries off could be any shape you want and That's how you would do it So the next section we're gonna look at is how I highlight the words on my shirt with an outline how I outline that So in my timeline here, I've got the two clips where I am standing up and I'm holding my shirt So that's where we want the outline to be so you notice I do have two different clips here So what I want to do is just select both my clips gonna right-click and I'm gonna say a new Fusion clip that way it's gonna put everything together in one fusion clip now We're gonna jump on over into fusion so this one is gonna be a little bit more complicated But still it's not too bad and we're gonna take the concepts We just learned and apply it to this particular video clip But the first thing we do before we start doing our outline in and all that is we need to Create a planar tracker and we want to do that because I am moving just a little bit And it's gonna be enough to notice it that if I just drew static letters You're gonna notice that I'm moving and the letters aren't so I'm gonna go ahead and select our median one And I'm gonna use shift and spacebar to bring up our tools I'm gonna type in tracker and we want to use the planar tracker Where's it playing our plane our tracker not planar plane are Either way click on that one and that should add it right into our node tree here So a couple things we want to start with make sure you're at the very beginning of your clip Make sure your planar tracker is selected then come on up into the inspector and tracker right here We want to change this to hybrid point area now depending on your clip. You may want to change the motion type I'm gonna try it on perspective first But sometimes I use one of these top guys right here and those might work out better depends on your clip and how things are moving So let's try perspective first and see how this works out then come on over into options and for trail length here I'm gonna bring this down to three next we need to make a shape around what we want to track So I'm gonna come into my viewer here and click on the the pen guy here I'm gonna zoom in on my image and I'm just gonna make a rough selection here around the words on my shirt You know to be too exact. I mean again, it may depend on your clip So I'm gonna go like that zoom out a little bit and now I'm gonna come over here And I'm gonna use this one right here track to the end so to track from where I'm at in the beginning of the clip All the way to the end. All right, so that's done Now that that's done come on over here and we have create planar transform go ahead and click on that So now that we did that we can get rid of this planar guy You can either just hit the delete button and get rid of it like that Or you can click on it and hold your shift key and it's gonna just disconnect it from from your nodes there So I'm just gonna disconnect it put on the side for now I'm also gonna leave this guy on the side because I found what I have sometimes I have some issues with the tracking before I get Started so the first thing I want to do is I'm gonna click on my median one Want to go ahead and add a background node now. That's gonna put a merge in here for us, which is perfect I got my background node Now I can set the color for it now if I want what color do I want to use? Let's see. Let's click on here. I know the cat words are yellow almost orange So I'm gonna go with a blue just because it's a nice contrasting color gonna hit okay, and now our screen is solid So now let's add in one of our tools over here that are gonna allow us to make the shape that we want So I want to use this guy right here Which is the polygon because it's gonna give me hard right angles and the letters are all pretty you know Geometric or whatever so I'm gonna go ahead and click on that and it dropped in the polygon for me So I'm just gonna make this look a little bit neater here And you notice now the blue is gone because we don't have anything drawn on our polygon layer yet The next thing I want to do is select on my polygon want to come on over to The inspector and I want to uncheck solid. I don't want it to be solid So next I need to trace whatever it is that I want to be highlighted and in this case I'm gonna do each letter individually because that could give you more options of how you might animate things or You know maybe change things later on if you want you want to change the colors for each one whatever So I'm gonna do them each individually I'm gonna click on my little tool here gonna zoom in and I want to make sure that I'm at the very beginning of The video clip and I'm just gonna trace right over top of the letters All right, so there we go The C is done now the log you take in tracing out your whatever it is you're trying to trace over the better It's gonna look so I didn't go too crazy here, but we're close enough I think so I'm gonna have my polygon selected and I want to come over here in the inspector to border with I'm gonna go ahead and boost that up a little and I want to fine-tune it a little So I'm gonna actually use this over here and I do want to soften the edge a little so I'm just gonna Come in here and fine-tune that a little bit And if I just click on a different node other than the polygon you'll see there we go our C is outlined So now I'm gonna go ahead and do the exact same thing with the a the t and the little triangle and one tip here If you want to just use the same color background you can just select it control C Click outside of a control V and just paste it and then you've got the same color You don't have to go re-pick it in each background node. We'll tip there for you So now that we've got all of our outlines done you notice if I play through this Look the words don't move right and that's not what we want So now is where we need to add in that planar tracker that we created or in this case the planar transform So where does this guy go? So where we want to put this is actually between our background nodes here and the merge node So I'm just gonna make a little space by selecting these guys Drag them down a little bit Make a little more room for ourselves here and all I have to do is grab this guy And I'm gonna hold the shift button click on this and drag it and drop it right in between Where the background node is and the merge one node now I need to do this for each one of these guys and like we talked about earlier you can copy paste these I'm gonna copy and paste and I'm just gonna drag it Holding shift drop it on there same thing copy paste Hold shift drag it on there Copy paste and copy paste. I'm just doing commander control C Commander control V copy and paste universal copy and paste drop that on there. All right now Let's play through and see how this is looking here. We got cat. Everybody loves a good caterpillar good big machine Right. There you go. It's right on there. We got cat perfect. It's good caterpillar good That looks great So if we just leave this as it is we can jump back into the edit tab and now let's see how it looks here and turn this off Right here, right? We got cat everybody loves good cat a pillow good right there. Right who doesn't it looks like it It works out pretty darn good I think and it's not all that hard It just takes a little bit of patience while you're working there in fusion So I don't have a super powerful machine. You don't need a ton of power to do this kind of stuff I mean unless you get real advanced I have a m1 Mac mini with 16 gigs of RAM and it does the job just fine on working on this kind of stuff So take a look at the last example here. We're looking at the church And if I play through you can see it just kind of pushes in towards the church here. So here's what we're gonna do with this clip We're gonna add the outline we're going to track the church and then we're also gonna animate it And then I've got some bonus tips for you that'll work for pretty much any of the animation So you want to stay tuned for that so let's jump into fusion here I'm gonna get back to the beginning of my clip select my clip and jump into fusion. All right So in fusion here. What's the first thing we want to do? We want to create some tracking right? We want to track that church so select your medium one shift space bar bring up the planer tracker Plane are plainer. I want to say plainer, but it says playing are Anyway, go ahead and add that guy in once that's added in there We want to come up to our pattern here select hybrid hybrid point area perspective. I'm gonna leave it on perspective We'll see how that works out and jump into options bring down the trail length just a little bit there Come on back next we need to draw our shape So I'm gonna zoom in by holding command or control on a PC middle mouse wheel zoom in and I'm just gonna make you know Kind of a rough outline here around the church so we can try and get some tracking points here Doesn't have to be perfect for the tracking Although if you do have some trouble you might want to try different tracking points, but I'm gonna try this first We'll see how that works out I'm also gonna hit the set button up here because we're not at the very beginning of the clip I did trim off a little so you can see right here. I want to make sure we're in the beginning I'm gonna hit the set and now we're gonna track from this point forward in the clip I was gonna throw the points on there does a pretty good job of tracking and there we go So we got our tracking I'm gonna go ahead and create the planer transform plane are playing our it's gonna get me every time So now I got my planer transform. I'm all set now Sometimes you can add this in first in your node tree here, but I've been having a little bit of issues with that with these examples in particular so what I'm gonna do is actually just do my background node and my Polygon node first make my outline and then I'll bring in the tracker the planer transform so that everything tracks perfectly So I'm gonna select a median one here I'm gonna add in the background node It'll put an emerge node for us and then I'm gonna select my background node one change the color We're gonna go ahead and make that yellow hit okay Next thing I want to add in is which one of these tools do I want to use and for me want to use polygon in this case So we're gonna add that guy in there selecting my polygon node We want to come over here and turn off solid because I don't want it to be solid I'm gonna just double check that you're at the beginning of your your clip right here and Now I'm gonna zoom into my clip and I'm just gonna outline the church So the better you're outlined the better it's probably gonna look depending on your situation and what you're trying to do So take your time make it look good and just do the best you can with outlining whatever's in your clip So I must be through this be right back All right got the outline complete there looks pretty good select my polygon We're gonna bring up our border with here a little bit I see the yellow coming in and I'm gonna soften that edge just a little bit All right next thing I want to do is I'm gonna grab my planer transform plane our Transform and we're gonna drag it down hold the shift key and drop it right into our little node tree So now when we play through let's zoom out here. This should look pretty good. Let's see what it looked like Looks good that highlights tracking with the church. I like the way it's looking Perfect. So next thing we want to do is animate this so select your polygon one and just like we did in previous examples here We're gonna want to adjust the position and the length so put the playhead at the beginning of your clip Come on over and hit the keyframes on your position and length. I'm gonna drop the length to zero I'm just gonna wiggle the position there to make sure we get that key frame set at zero. I'm gonna come in and Let's say I want to come. I don't know maybe halfway I'm gonna boost my length up to one that'll add a key frame there and then let's say for position I want it to go around like five times or so see how that looks. I'm gonna punch in five So let's see how that looks and I'm just gonna click out here in the space off my polygon one node So that way I don't see that little red line there. So let's see how does this look back to begin my clip? I Alright that's pretty cool. I like that now Let's say we want to animate it coming off too as the clip comes to an end So let's see. I'm gonna come back here. I want to jump to my keyframes. So we're at this keyframe I'm gonna come ahead a little bit Save out there. I'm gonna click the keyframe button add another keyframe And then I'm gonna come to the end of my clip and I'm just gonna drag these back to zero So length back to zero and position back to zero coming back to begin my clip. How does it look? Let's see what it looks like. I We've got the animation on as we zoom in and it's gonna hold steady and then boom it's gonna flash out So it's pretty quick at the end. Maybe we wanted to leave a little more frames But whatever you get the idea you pick whatever works for your clip Now let's get in some bonus tips here on how you can make that animation look just a little bit sweeter Look a little bit smoother and just look a little bit better. Alright, here's what we're gonna do First thing we're gonna do is click on our polygon node And we actually want to come up into the spline right here So open that up and you're gonna get this little chart here So find your polygon one or if you used you know the this guy the the spline or the ellipse or the rectangle Whatever you used find it here and check it on so that all the items are showing now you can see when we put in the keyframes It's a little bit of a abrupt adjustment there So let's just zoom to fit everything here. What I want to do is come in here I'm gonna just select all these points just draw a window around them and What I want to do is once they're selected just press the letter s and it's gonna smooth out all those curves And if you want to adjust anything you can come in and make adjustments as you want You can see this one comes up a little high Maybe I want to bring these guys down a little bit bring that guy like that All right, cool looks good, but you can just press s and just leave it like that and it's gonna work out just fine too So that's just gonna kind of smooth out that animation a little bit and make it look even sweeter once you do that That's all you got to do here You can go ahead and close the spline the next thing you want to do is why you have that polygon selected come on up to Settings up here and we want to turn on some motion blur right because motion blur just makes everything look a little bit better Come on, let's be honest right so you can leave it at two if you want I'm gonna crank it up to like five here, and we'll just leave it at that so now if we come back here Let's play through our clip. I'm just gonna click out here in space. So we don't get the little red outline there Let's see how that looks You can see it kind of eases into that speed of the animation there and comes off pretty good I don't know about you guys I think that looks pretty cool and this has like a million different uses of how you could use it in your videos It's a great tool to having your bag when you want to try to do something cool and a little bit different in your videos All right, so that wraps up this one guys I hope you learned a little something if you did give this video a thumbs up for me subscribe to the channel if you haven't already If you have any troubles leave a comment down below with that said guys. I look forward to seeing you in the next one. Peace I Think that all to do it. Yeah, I think that would work. Why not right? Why not? I don't know if you guys can hear it man They're cutting down some major trees outside got big dead ash trees We've got the emerald ash borer out here you guys ever hear that in the United States here Who that bad boy sweeping across the country last decade or so and they finally made it here and killed all the ash trees On the street, so they'll be out there chopping some wood. Anyway It's going to fusion How am I getting where in the world are those keyframes coming from? What bro you're killing me smalls Wait, is there two here? Where is that coming from? That's so odd something else is going on here dude reset. Oh because it already was a Alright, just do this is crazy. All right scratch. Let's do that again take two of the ending because the other ending did not work out so well So take two here on the ending all right last and final example My head in there what? Go a little wider. Oh too much That is finally after how many recordings I don't know I think we finally got it now we can get this guy into the computer Let's go edit. Let's go edit You
