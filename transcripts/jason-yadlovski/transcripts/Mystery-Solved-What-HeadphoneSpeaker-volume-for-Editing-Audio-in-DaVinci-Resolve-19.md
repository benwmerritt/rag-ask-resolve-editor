So you're jumping into DaVinci Resolve, you're gonna start editing your audio and you wanna know, well, how how should I be making my audio? Like what should I put my volume at for my listening device, right? You might be editing on some monitor speakers, you might be using any one of a different number of headphones, I've got some Samson's here, I've got Sennheiser's here, I've got Baro Dynamics here, I've got Mackies, I've got even earbuds like these from Sandware, as well as earbuds from places like Apple. So where do I set the volume and I'm trying to edit my audio on any one of these devices? I'm gonna give you a second, go comment down below, pause the video, I wanna know what you think before I continue. And we're back. So the honest answer here is that it almost doesn't matter what volume that you listen to your audio at, just it should just be a comfortable listening level for you. So you can crank up the volume on your speakers if you wanna hear it nice and loud, but when it comes to actually setting the volume or the levels of your audio, you really wanna watch the meters. The meters in DaVinci Resolve are gonna tell the story of where exactly you should put that audio. Now it is important to make sure that you can hear the different parts of your audio, whether you're using monitor speakers, headphones, earbuds, whatever it might be, you wanna be able to hear those different parts of your audio so that way you can make sure you are editing the audio to get rid of things that don't sound good, you wanna be able to blend different sounds together, whether it's sound effects, music, dialogue, blending that all together. Obviously the listening device that you're on is gonna make a big difference in what that sounds like and how you can hear those different things that you wanna change, but the volume that you set your speakers at from your computer can almost be anywhere. It should be a comfortable listening level, but let's jump in Resolve here and just talk through a little bit of levels here and checking out our meters. So in DaVinci Resolve here, I've got my pile of headphones, my monitor speakers sitting right here, and I can adjust that level on my computer however I might like to. Now when you wanna set the listening volume here in DaVinci Resolve, you can use this slider right here to set the volume coming out of Resolve. Now this is just a volume adjustment for your ears, what you're hearing. This is not setting levels for your project or your tracks or anything like that. You can also mute it if you want by clicking that or you can just dim it down a little bit by hitting the dim button. The other thing you can think about is on your computer itself. If you come up to your sound settings, I can adjust my sound settings to be wherever I want, typically minor around, I don't know, 75%, something like that, and that's gonna be just fine. But in DaVinci Resolve, if I play back through my video here, we wanna watch the meters for our music, our sound effects, our dialogue. We want the meters to tell us the story of what's happening with our audio because we might have the volume really low on our headphones here, and then we might be like, oh, I need something to be a whole lot louder, and then I boost it up. But you might not notice that you're getting a little too high, you're clipping a little bit there, and that's not what you want to happen. So if it sounds like you need to hear it louder, boost it up on your headphones a little bit, and we wanna make sure that the meters tell us the story of what's happening with our audio in conjunction with listening to everything mixed together as a whole. So if you need to turn up the volume on your individual headphones or speakers, that's perfectly fine. Crank up the volume a little bit so that you can hear it good and clear. Now by watching the meters, how do you know if when you're done editing all of your audio, if it's in a spot that would be good for other people to listen to? Well, that's kind of where we come into something like loudness, right? So after we've edited our whole video together here, you're gonna wanna jump over in the fairlight, and then in fairlight here, if we go ahead and toggle on our automation, we can get this little graph on our bus one down here, and we can check the loudness, the overall loudness of our video. Now, depending on the platform that you're creating for, and in my case, it's primarily YouTube, we wanna meet minus 14 LUFS. And that's a measurement of everything together, the whole loudness, how does it come across to our viewer? How is it getting measured on the YouTube platform? And minus 14 LUFS is that limit that we're allowed to go to. So if we do all of our audio editing, you get everything set up good by the meters, it sounds good when you mix it together, and then you go through that process of checking your loudness, which I've got videos on showing you how to do that and how to meet different standards, then you should be good to go. You could keep your headphones at a very low volume and be able to just mix and blend everything together the way you think sounds good, and then check your overall loudness and make sure that, okay, everything is as loud as it could be without going over the allowable limits for the platform you're editing for, in our case, YouTube. But again, the thing to keep in mind is that at the end of the day, the meters are gonna tell you the story, right? It's gonna tell us if we're clipping. Now, you could hear that in the headphones too, but it's gonna tell us if we're clipping, it's gonna tell us if we're too quiet between using our meters to edit our audio levels and using the overall loudness to measure at the very end of our audio editing process, that's gonna give us the best picture of where our audio should be and how to make it sound the best that we can for our viewers. Now, one interesting fact that I'm gonna make another video on coming up here is that when you use different types of headphones, monitor speakers, earbuds, whatever it might be, you're gonna get different results, right? Each one of these devices are created a little bit differently by their manufacturer. The frequencies sound a little different. Some have more bass, some have less. Some are flat response headphones for audio editing. Others, like something like Beats by Dre, already have bass built into them or Bose headphones. They've got the bass built in. So we'll talk about that in another video, but keep that in mind. Depends on what device you're using as far as the results that you'll get. Now, you'll probably be in the same ballpark, but you're gonna notice a difference between different kinds of headphones. So we'll talk about that in another video. But if you've got questions on what volume should my speakers or headphones be, drop a comment down below. With that said, get out there, try to edit some of your audio, make it sound the best that it can, and I will see you in the next video. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.
