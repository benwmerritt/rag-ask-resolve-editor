Free versus Studio, track level audio effects here in DaVinci Resolve. So if you're brand new to resolve you might be a little confused on which ones are in the free version and which ones are in studio. That's what I'm gonna show you. Let's jump in resolve, check this out. In DaVinci Resolve here let's talk about the track level audio effects that are in the free version first. So in order to show these track level effects you want to make sure you have your track selected. Now I'm clicking over here and it doesn't look like the track's getting selected but it actually is getting selected if you click anywhere over in this area. Next you want to go and open up your inspector and you should see your track level effects appear right here. Now because I have studio you're gonna see all of the track level effects right here but the ones that come in the free version are the dialog leveler. So if I go ahead and turn that on this is the dialog leveler right here. Now this is gonna automatically adjust the levels of your dialog to whatever you set it to. You can bring it up a little bring it down a little but it's gonna automatically adjust your audio levels for you. So that is in the free version. The other one here that's in the free version is the ducker and that was just updated in resolve 19.1 where now we can select a multiple source tracks for our track to respond to right. You can select whatever number of tracks that you want add in more tracks so that way whatever track I'm turning the ducker on for example a music track I can now have it react to several different tracks of dialogue. So the ducker is gonna be in the free version for you as well and you can also click on this little icon to pop out the ducker. Here's what it looks like you can adjust your different settings here with the dials instead of using the sliders in the inspector. You do it whichever way works best for you. So those are the two that are in the free version you have the dialog leveler as well as the ducker. Those are both gonna be in the free version. Let's take a look at the ones that are in studio. When it comes to the studio version of resolve again back in my inspector here the ones that we now have available to us are the ones that are in the free version as well as voice isolation which is going to be the best background noise removal tool that resolve has and I would venture to say the best background removal tool at all right. If you need background noise removal for your audio just buy studio because you're gonna get all the other benefits of having studio and voice isolation works awesome. It's so good to voice isolation is studio only and here's what that looks like again you can adjust it in your inspector or you can pop out the little window like this. The dialog separator is a studio only feature here and if I open it up you can see we have the ability to adjust the voice background and ambience. We can mute any of those if we want or we can just adjust the mix of how all those things are coming together. Again you can adjust the sliders here or you can pop out the little window right here and you can use the dials to make the adjustments that you want to. So this is a studio only feature. Closing the dialog separator the music remixer is also a studio only feature. So if I open it up here you can see we've got our two different options of how we can edit this or work with it and it allows us to increase or decrease any of these items that we see here the voice drums bass guitar and other which would be things like your keyboard or other musical instruments that might be part of a song. So that is going to be a studio only feature the music remixer. So those are the ones that are in the free version versus the studio now just another note while you can apply these on an entire track level you can also apply some of these effects onto clips directly. So if you just take a look and resolve here if I select one clip and I'm in the audio tab in the inspector here you can see I can apply voice isolation dialog leveler and the music remixer directly onto a clip if that's something that I want to do. So you've got options on how you want to use these different tools. And while you can access all of the track level effects right here in the edit page if you jump into Fairlight I just wanted to show you another place that you can access all these track level effects and that is in your mixer open up your mixer and right here we have track effects. Now you notice I only have two right here but if I come to these three dots I click on the three dots I could come down to visible track effects and then right here I can check on all the ones that I want to see in the mixer here. So it just makes them real easy to turn them on when it comes to turn them on on the entire track level. So you do it in the edit page you can do it in Fairlight the choice is up to you. But overall if you need good audio tools Studio is worth the upgrade. It's a one time price 295 I think it still is. It's just a no brainer if you need some of these tools because not only do you get these couple tools but you get everything that Studio offers. So I mean small little sales pitch you know for Studio just go ahead and pick it up because there's so much benefits to having Studio versus just having the free version. Now don't get me wrong the free version is great and it's gonna take you a long way. I used it a long time creating my YouTube videos here until I felt like I was getting held back a little bit and I needed some of those extra features and then I upgraded to Studio. So just a long story short Studio is worth the money that you pay one time price you have all upgrades for ever because Blackmagic Design is awesome and they all know that we don't like subscriptions right? So the everything that you get with Studio from all the different tabs here it's just it just makes it so worth it if you edit videos often. I mean it's really worth it. That's all I could say it's worth it. So I hope this was helpful to you guys just to understand which track level effects are in the free version in in Studio and with that said I'm gonna see you guys in the next video. you
