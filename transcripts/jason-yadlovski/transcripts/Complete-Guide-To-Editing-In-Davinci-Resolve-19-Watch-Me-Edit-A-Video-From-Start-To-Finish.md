Today I'm gonna show you how I create a quick tip Tuesday video from start to finish I've already gone ahead and recorded everything But I thought it might be interesting for you guys just to kind of see my process that I go through here to create all my YouTube videos And this is a quick tip Tuesday, so it should be relatively quick to put together I'll speed through some parts that are boring for you here But I kind of explain things that that I do and how I create my videos Just so you guys might maybe grab a couple tips out of there or learn a little something new about Kind of how I make my videos here So let's just jump on the computer and get going here on creating this quick tip Tuesday video That's already out. I'll link to it. You guys can see it already already created But here's how I created the video, so let's just get going and make this quick tip Tuesday video All right, so cool that should be good So here's what I got going on as we start out working on a quick tip Tuesday So I've already filmed everything now when I film I film on my C100 mark 2 as well as record my screen As well as the audio from my screen as the end the audio from my good microphone, which is up here So I've got audio on the camera to sync up with my good audio. I got my screen recording now I do all my screen recording right here in screen flow it It's a Mac only program, but it does a really good job, and I've been using it for a long time Let me shrink this guy down here so you can see it This is what screen flow looks like now when you go to you could record I can record, you know multiple audio sources Just windows the whole screen. I usually record the whole screen and and that works out pretty good So basically in my screen flow here I've got my full screen recording which in this case was about six minutes six and a half minutes and What I'm gonna do is go through my screen recording here gonna play through it And I'm gonna just do all my blow-ups and highlights and that kind of stuff because for me I think it's a little bit easier to do it here in screen flow Then it is to do it in DaVinci resolve now I know there's other tools and resolve that could work out and it could be just fine But I've been doing it in screen flow here for years, and it's just it's quick. It's easy I got a couple presets I use for my enlargements and blow-ups and zooming in on the cursor So that's just what I do now my good audio is actually recorded right here in the screen flow So my first step once I've recorded is to export out my good audio So I'm just gonna mute my screen recording track, right? Because this is my screen recording video as well as any audio that came through with the screen recording So I mute that because I only want my dialogue, right? I don't want any of the screen recording stuff to get mixed in with my dialogue So I'm just gonna come up to file I go export and then I'm gonna find my file location where I want to put it I have an audio folder right here. That's where I like to put it now I'm typically gonna go manual mode here for type and I export lossless audio only which gives me the best quality audio That I can export from screen flow here, and then I'm just gonna go ahead and hit export So that's quick and easy audio is exported out now I'm gonna turn my audio for my video track back on always make sure you've got a good cup of coffee here to do a little editing here nice and early in the morning So the next step is I'm just gonna watch through my video and I'm gonna add in some Alarmments and blow-ups now I'm not gonna make any cuts in here because I want to sync this up with my video from the C100 mark 2 With my talking head stuff once I get it into resolve so I'm just gonna go through play through and I'm gonna add highlights or blow-ups wherever I think they're necessary So I'll show you a little bit of that and then I'll speed through the rest and actually first thing actually even before I do that I'm going to change the the Size of my video here, so I'm gonna come to file Document settings make sure I'm on 1920 by 1080 and then I'm just gonna rescale my window here because I have a big wide-screen monitor So I've set little actually a screen background so that I can tell what size I need to make my DaVinci resolve video window so that it fits perfectly on a 1920 by 1080 which is Right there. It looks pretty good. Can zoom in make sure I'm not cutting it off at all Yep, it looks pretty good to me So now I've got my DaVinci resolve window there and now I'm gonna watch through and just create my highlights and blow-ups and The first thing that I can do is select my Video recording track and I have a preset where it'll automatically show the radars right where and when I click it'll make that red bubble So all I have to do is come up to here I'm gonna go my presets and I've got this guy default mouse and radar So now anytime I click on the screen you're gonna see that red radar kind of pop out and draw some attention to it I also made the cursor a little bit bigger there In the video recording just so it's easier for you guys to see so now just cruise through and look for some areas We want to highlight in large or blow up. So check this out a lot of times when I'm recording I'm gonna have two microphones up to my camera. I'm gonna have maybe two lab mics Sometimes when I'm filming a video and I've got multiple people in the video and a lot of times at this point I can just kind of scrub through and look for the parts that I want to start at I don't need to watch through I'm not editing. I'm not doing any cuts. I'm just looking for where I want to do enlargements and things And I do Use my JKNL keys to speed through it a little bit quicker No reason to watch it in real time when I can speed through it a little bit faster One person is recorded on the right channel and in resolve we can select which channel we want to use for a given piece of audio So in this case I have an audio clip right here now I'm not showing my video clips because I got some of the kids in there So we want to show that We're for inspector now. Let's say I want to highlight where my cursor is at the moment here. I can select my Recorded video track here. I'm gonna come to my call outs. I'm gonna go action and I've got a preset cursor Circle cursor red zoom and now when it hits this little yellow part here It's gonna enlarge the cursor automatically for me. So in this case I have an audio clip right here now I'm not showing my video clips because I got some of the kids in there So we don't want to show that but I got my audio clip selected And now if I want to highlight where I'm coming to the inspector It's gonna do the same thing and if I want to make this longer or shorter I can zoom in on my timeline a little bit and I can just drag it and make it bigger or smaller And it's got to built-in, you know fade in fade out with the the build right here And all my stuff is already preset. So I just hit the preset make it as long as I want and boom That's it. That's all I do for a circular call out come to our inspector So let's say I want to drop make that stop there come to our inspector and now I want to highlight the inspector So I'm gonna again add a call out now. I have two Shapes where I can draw custom, you know squares so I can highlight it or I can have it highlight in zoom So a lot of times that on the inspector here. I'm gonna highlight and then select my square Highlight it like this and then if I want to zoom I can always come over here and change my mind and zoom up But for now if I hit play and then we come over to the it just highlights that but if I wanted to zoom it up I could just zoom it up But you see what happens is it kind of goes off the screen there? So that's a little wonky sometimes so sometimes I can't zoom it up if it's all the way on the one edge of the screen But it's all right. It's good enough the file section now about you guys Everyone highlight this so here maybe we'll try a zoom up. I've got my custom square highlight zoom So let's come in here and select that see and preview the different audio tracks that are part of this file Another enlarged highlight here Okay, so since this is a quick tip Tuesday That's pretty much all the highlights that I need to do here if I just zoom out of my timeline not a whole lot Right now obviously the longer the video the more call outs I have the more details I want to show as far as blow ups and things like that I'm gonna do a lot more of this but for a quick tip Tuesday boom. That's it. I'm done It only took I don't know a few minutes. So now I'm gonna export this out. I'm gonna save it go file Export I'm gonna again go manual. I'm gonna select my file location. I always put this in my draft video folder here and say open and It's got the wrong name in there So I'm gonna call it source audio channels and I've created a preset here for the way I want the video to be rendered out so I'm just gonna go ahead and click presets and down here I have web resolve tutorial high quality 29.97 because I film in 29.97 So this way everything will sync up nice again I'm gonna leave the resolution at 1920 by 1080 because that's what I edit in in resolve and then I export in 4k that you'll see So I'm just gonna go ahead and hit export gives me an estimated file size We let this run and then we'll move on to the next step to my hit export and let it do its thing Now is usually when I go get you know another coffee, you know, go grab a little snack some breakfast or something like that Maybe throw in a load of laundry, you know go clean up something a little bit work on a little something else with you know YouTube answer a couple comments something like that You know kill a little bit of time. That's all or just hang with you guys You know we just hang so the next part of the process here is actually to use a program called recut where I can bring in My talking head as well as my screen recording and then it's gonna automatically Chop up the file and create a DaVinci resolve timeline that has all of the silences removed, right? So when I'm filming obviously I'm stopping I'm checking something maybe moving around I want to cut out all those silences and instead of having to go and resolve and make all those cuts manually recut does all that for you and It works out really awesome and Casey Ferris told me about this tool a while back Thanks so much Casey because this tool has been a huge time saver Especially with longer videos or you're doing a podcast or something like that this little program recut Does an awesome job at just kind of helping speed up the process for you. So our render is done here So let's go ahead and open up recut. This is what it looks like now. You can just drag and drop files into here so I'm gonna go ahead and Open up my my file path here And I want to bring in the screen recording that I just exported so I'm gonna drag and drop that in and then I also Want to bring in my talking head So I'm gonna go find my C100 footage and I'm gonna drop that in now in here I want to sync these two up right and this is where it's really important to have You know a good sync point for your talking head or your multiple Forms of recording so if I just zoom in on my timeline here. We can see I've got my three claps and In here I can select the whole clip move it over put my playhead here I'm gonna zoom in as far as I can and I'm gonna line them up as close as possible And it's gonna be good enough because it's alright if the screen recording is off just a little bit not a big deal But I'm just gonna play through and listen to see how it sounds think I'm up And I can even you know make a little adjustment listen again Think I'm up All right, so that's I think good enough it's close enough You know it may not be exact because I think the screen actually records in 30 and even though I export it in 2997 is a little bit of you know where it's off sometimes But I'm you I'm not gonna use the audio from the actual screen recording anyway, so it should be fine so next thing I'm gonna do is Come and I'm gonna zoom out on my timeline here and now we can see all these red spots now sometimes it looks like it's not working properly Because what it should be doing is taking out all of the spaces in between where I'm talking now here It looks a little odd right so sometimes I might just actually delete them and then bring them in again And maybe start this time with You know my talking head and then bring in my my other audio there and now we can see it looks a little bit better Sometimes I don't know why that happens. It just it just does so let's zoom in here. I'm gonna redline these guys up Alright zoom out looks pretty good So it's gonna automatically give me a timeline that's got all these pink spaces already chopped out of it Which saves a lot of time here resolve now You can go through and adjust the the different you know amounts of space that it's looking for or quiet that's looking for You know kind of customize a little bit what I have here just found I found works pretty good for me So then I'm just gonna go export DaVinci resolve right here. You've got different You know whatever programs and things that you can use a screen for look at that might be new because I just did it update in This program so you can keep the silent segments I don't I don't want them and I can always extend clips back out if I want you know something that might be missing or whatever And then I'm gonna go ahead and hit export just gonna dump the timeline in my project folder boom It's done. I closed this out. We're good to go now. We can go ahead and open up DaVinci resolve So getting started in resolve and create a new project. I like to use the date. This is a quick tip Tuesday I'm gonna call it inspector source Audio channel and go ahead and hit create so now in resolve here. I've got a Preset or a project settings that I have as my default settings where it already creates You know the right timeline and all that kind of stuff that I need are not the timeline But the right frame rate for the DaVinci resolve file all my project settings are already set So all they do is open it up and I'm good to go So now I'm gonna just start bringing in my my assets here And I work in the edit tab or never use the cut tab because I just don't it's cool But I never use it so I'm always in the edit tab. So I'm just gonna start by bringing in my Footage from my C100 just in case you know something might be different, you know with the project settings when I drop in my clip here If anything was different the frame rate was wrong on accident This would update it for me. It would you know pop up the message next I'm gonna bring in my audio my good audio that I'm gonna sync up with my good camera right here next I'm gonna bring in My screen recording and that's it. That's what I'm gonna start with so the next thing that I'm gonna do is Before I bring in the timeline that I created from recut. I actually want to sync up my good audio So I'm gonna select my good audio as well as my video clip I'm gonna right-click and come down to sync audio or auto sync audio that'll bring up this guy I'm gonna go by waveform Typically, I'm gonna use track one, but you can change these if you need to I'm gonna hit sync and just like that. I've got my good audio if I want to check it I can right-click I can come down to clip attributes right here go to my audio tab We've got our linked channel one and link channel two is our right and left channels perfect good That is good to go bring it up. We could just double check it here. What does it sound like two lab mics? Let's say no, I don't like all right. Yep. That looks good to me So now we're gonna bring in our timeline that was created from recut. I'm gonna right-click timelines import Select the first option here Next I'll come to my project folder there and that is my timeline go ahead and import that now I do get some options here That you could you know make adjustments by bring just bringing in that timeline I uncheck automatically set project settings and automatically import clips because you can do that But I've already got the stuff there everything else I leave as it is and I just go ahead and hit okay and boom there's my timeline with everything in it my whole Project there with all the cuts and everything so what I like to do now is I got a double check right because sometimes it'll put like in this case right my Talking head is on track number two, which is what I want But the audio for that is on track number one and I like to keep them like you know on track two on track two So I'm just gonna go ahead and switch that around we're gonna open up the index here in the index I'm gonna go to tracks and I'm just gonna switch my two audio tracks so that now we are good to go I'm gonna rename these MK e600. That's my good microphone. That's what we're synced up to this one is screen flow Which is I call SF? This is gonna be the C100 C100 mark two and here we're gonna call this screen flow I'm gonna take a little sip of coffee here because that's what we do while we're editing We have a little coffee while we edit right by the way. I use pour over you guys do pour over Oh, man is good stuff good stuff Then I also like to change the track colors just because I like to see it a little different So I like to make my talking head yellow and then you know or orange and then I've been on a teal kick or For the the talking head are the screen recording stuff so that is pretty much it now I'm gonna go through edit through the video and What I'm gonna do is you know just remove any of the clips that I don't want I'm gonna make sure the video is flowing and I'm just getting to the parts that I want to say because obviously there's still gonna be some Parts in here that don't need to be there So let's just start by taking a look here. I know in the beginning here I just synced it up so those are gonna go or a screen flow record Ah, and you know what happens here sometimes sometimes the first clip right? I get the I switch the tracks up and down and it works out well, but then moving ahead a little bit It goes back. I don't know why it does that sometimes so In order to take care of that I'm just gonna delete these first few clips here because I know I don't need them and say now We're back to the situation that we started with which was my bad for not checking that so I'm just gonna come back to my index We're gonna switch these and now I got to switch my names because this one is actually the MKE 600 and this one is the screen flow So that works out good now one thing that I typically do that I forgot to do this time with my screen recording is I will mute my talking head track, right when I export out my screen recording So that way I don't have to come through here and mute all these guys And anything that comes across, you know in the screen recording as far as you know audio that was on The computer will come through so I'll probably go back and re-export this out and just turn off my talking head audio So that way I don't have to worry about it I could just leave that track where it is but for now I'm just gonna mute that track and I'm gonna start to watch through the video here and we're gonna work on The little bit of an edit so here we go There we go So I know all that no good and a lot of times I'm gonna watch it two times speed just to try and cruise through it a little bit faster So the first time I'm going through here, I'm just gonna do a quick pass through now One thing I forgot to mention is that while I do have my good audio synced up in my talking headshot When I bring in that timeline for some reason it doesn't just automatically grab that good audio So here's how we fix that and I think I even had a quick tip Tuesday about this a while back But if I hold my option or all keys select all my audio tracks Right-click. I'm gonna come down to clip attributes It's gonna open my clip attributes for those clips and I'm gonna change this to link channel one and link channel two Now I've got my good audio associated with my talking head and that's gonna be the audio I use for the video So I don't know why with the recut sometimes I got to do that, but it's no big deal You know, it's pretty quick just change it all at once there boom done So now we're just gonna work through our edit and I'm gonna just do like a pass through here first now One thing is when I go into Talking about you know in showing what's going on in resolve I like to put you know put my head down in the corner a little bit kind of like it should be right now So to do that I've done it a bunch of different ways in the past but currently I'm using one of Jake whips Presets which I like a lot So if I go to my effects library here and then I come to my effects section. I've got whip cam I'm gonna come and drop that on my clip And you can see now puts me over here. I like it in a different spot So I'm gonna open my inspector with my clip selected go to the effects I am going to go to Bottom left which is usually where I like to put it Maybe in this case I'm going to put it up here though because then it's more out of the way So that looks pretty good. You can adjust it here if you want to make it bigger smaller move it around You've got options on you know changing things here. It animates in and out So in this case, I just wanted to animate in so here's what that's going to look like So check this out a lot of times when I'm recording Okay, so that's pretty good now I can reframe it because it looks like I'm off to the side a little there so I can move myself over It's just moving the video within the frame a little bit Um, and that looks pretty good. So I got the shadow on there Now what I typically do is I'm going to go ahead and select once I or well once I get all the settings I want, right? I know this is the way I like it close my inspector. I'm going to select this clip copy And then I'm just going to paste this onto all of my other clips Actually, you know what I'm going to do before I even do that I'm going to paste it onto the next clip So this one I know is going to be out I'm going to paste it on here with option or alt v I'm just going to select all the attributes apply But before I go ahead and copy it to the rest of them what I'm going to do is select that clip Come back to my inspector go to the animate and I don't want these to animate in I just want them to already be the uh the smaller window there So I'm going to turn that off Now this is what I'm going to use to copy zoom out I'm going to just select the rest of the video tracks and then I'm going to option or alt v Bring up this window apply boom now They all have that window and it's good enough. I can make a little adjustments as I go But at least they've all already got it and I don't have to do it for every individual clip So speeds it up makes it nice and quick. So now we're going to watch through and work on this edit a little bit So check this out a lot of times when I'm recording I'm going to have two microphones up to my camera I'm going to have maybe two lab mics. Uh, let's say no, I don't like that. All right, so check this out Sometimes when I'm filming a video I've got multiple people in the video I'll put a lab mic on each person and then I have that audio go into my camera so that one person's recorded on All right, so these clips no good we'll get rid of that You can see I mess up a lot and I take a lot out. You only got to show the the good part You only got to get it right once right? So uh, that's that's just how we work here Media pool at So right here I want to move my guy. So I'm just going to make a cut I'm going to select the next clip and come to my effects and I'm going to move it to the bottom So it's going to move it down there and I'm just going to throw in a little transition a little slide down transition That I created that I use all the time just for you know A little bit of interest to just have it slide down See where they at here. Where's the uh, there we go slide down 12 frames boom drop that on here's what that looks like In my uh media pool at a clip for example, if I just come and open the file of this guy right here Have it selected into my media pool and I've got my inspector opening. I mean the file tab I can see and preview Now if I want to enlarge this a little bit more I can Just enlarge it in resolve here So if I let it blow up like that and then I can add a couple key frames move ahead one two three four Say five frames. I'm gonna make that a little bit bigger bring it over Center it up how I want Now I would need to you know copy these settings Let's say maybe I want to make them a little bit, you know easier to copy so I might come back here and make this 1.5 and minus 455 and 6 that's all right, so I'll come over here. I'll go 1.5 minus 433 and 136 and left channel which we're both recorded separately so if I come in here and just put the little playhead right Oh, and you see I pop back up to the top there. I mean, it's all right You know it's depends on what you want to do, but let's say I want to copy that Uh, so that it stays down the bottom here I'm gonna paste it on the next few spots here option or old v paste boom So that'll stay where it's at. It's separately. So if I come in here and just put the little So it shifted a little I might I got 450. Oh, yeah, this is minus 455 helps if you get your numbers right So now it's gonna change but I can just take this one copy And paste these guys all option or alt v. I select all my options paste So there's one person now if I go to the track number two So here's where if I unmute my uh screen recording, you'll hear what's happening there click down here All right All right, so we're gonna get rid of these because we don't need that much you guys don't need to hear that much of it down here All right, that's good. We're gonna delete that And to do the ripple deletes. I've set up my uh What was it? Oh, she's q and w without looking I just I just hit the buttons. Yeah q Or I'm sorry. W. Yeah w and q I've set up to make a cut and ripple delete to the left and to the right Um, it's just such habit here. I don't even think about what I'm doing half the time Um, but you can hear here too. Also. So I will re export out my um my screen recording So that way you'll only hear like the clapping like this Is that my bubblegum? Right because that's what's in the screen recording Um, and you won't hear my dialogue which you'll hear double over here right now So there's one person now if I go so I'll go back and do that after but uh for now it's it's fine I'm just gonna mute it go to the track number two the other channel Other person and I've also the other channel Now you hear the other person and I've also got one where it's got them combined where they would all be in the same track Now I want to and now we're just gonna cruise on with our edit Gonna copy and paste this over to here and here And I think what I'd like to do is while I'm talking here Maybe make my head a little bit bigger because why not? Now let's say I'm looking in my uh media pool at a clip so I'm actually whoops gonna come to uh this clip right here Let's go ahead and make me a little bit bigger. So if I come into the effects, I can just increase the camera size here Tricks out good now. I'm just gonna copy this clip and I'm gonna paste it onto the rest of these clips here with option Or all v this paste attributes. I mean I use it all the time comes in real handy Oh So since I zoomed in there on the other Program in the screen recording itself. I'm gonna come here Gonna click start our keyframes one two three four and then I'm gonna go back to just you know regular size And location uh for my screen recording You can do a custom here's that looks like umano you can do adaptive or you can do a custom where it'll open up All right, get rid of these guys and then now we're back to just regular full screen talking head So I can just come up here I can delete the effect there and I'm just gonna copy and paste this across the rest of them paste I'm gonna actually throw in a little transition here another slide up However, you might want to do that. So this new little tip here is really handy when you come Take these guys out So there are a lot of times where I'll do multiple takes whether it's an intro an outro Whatever it might be I'll just say it a few times and just use the best take there because I don't script it out I'm not reading off anything. I just I'm just talking to you guys. However, you know, it comes into my mind and stuff So um so like in this case I did it and then I was like meh meh And I like it do better. So I did another one and that's what we use for the ending here I'll see you in the next video. Peace. All right, so we go video. Peace So I'll do that. We'll end on the piece I'm gonna actually get rid of some of the Screen recordings there. I want to say peace out. I like to fade it out just a few frames Looks good fade the audio out there because the chair made a weird noise. Peace video, please All right, that's pretty good. So we did our initial uh edit there. It looks like it ends up being about you know Three minutes and 15 seconds. Not bad for a quick tip Tuesday So now I'm gonna go back and further refine it a little bit We're gonna do uh, let's work on a little bit of an intro here If your video clips have a multiple source So I'm gonna disable this clip below give a little fade in If your video clips have so I think I want to add in some music now Sometimes I'll go search for new music in this case just for you know being a little speedy here We're gonna pick out some music. I've already got I got power bin set up with like all my music from the different companies that I love That I use their stuff all the time. Maybe we'll check out some epidemic sound And now we'll just pick a few and see if anything sounds good So uh, this one sounds kind of cool. Let's try this one. So just gonna select the end points I'm gonna get rid of the beginning there. Just bring this down. We're gonna drop it in and go music Now I could use the automatic ducker and all that kind of stuff But I'm only gonna really be playing it kind of in the intro here. So I'll just drop it down Uh, you know, and we're just gonna make it sound the way that we want For this case because I think it's just easier to do it that way for me So I'm gonna actually Zoom in let's see how this sounds if your video clips have a moment So I'm gonna start here bring it up a little bit I'm actually gonna select all my other clips using a command a And then I'm gonna hold command again and just deselect the music because I want the music to start kind of before I come in So I'll go like this drag it over a little bit. I ball it up there If your video clips have multiple sources of audio built we All right, that's not too bad now. Uh, the next thing I want to do is I'm just gonna apply my audio Work to my track here real quick just so that I know my set level for my dialogue my dialogue Yeah, um, so let me open my mixer just kind of see where my levels are at from a dialogue Clips have multiple sources of audio built within that clip Okay, so not too bad. They could be boosted a little bit What I like to do Is when I set up my microphone to record it records at levels maybe around minus 15 ish db. So usually I need about a 5 db boost in my dialogue. So I'm just gonna select all of them Come to the end hold shift select all of them open my inspector. I'm just gonna boost them all up by 5 Um, and that should be putting me in a better spot. I want to check this out jumping resolve I gotta show you something sometimes when I'm filming a video and I've got multiple all right So that's actually a little a little loud there. So I'm gonna shift z zoom all gonna select all of them I'm gonna come back to my inspectors changes to like 2.5 And uh go with that see how that how that's looking which channel we want to use For a given piece of audio. So in the okay, so that's fine. I mean it's peeking up But we're gonna throw a compressor and stuff on there. So just to get my audio levels like kind of done and set I'm gonna jump into fairlight. I've got a preset that I just dump on there. I'm gonna go fairlight presets library I've got a global track preset call right here 2024 mini eq. I'm gonna apply to my mke 600 track Apply Looks like I had it set as orange whatever it doesn't really matter But you can see I've got my effects on there. I've got my effects order I've got my dynamics just a slight bit of eq there and then I'm gonna listen to it and just see how it sounds and Make sure I like what I'm hearing. So I'm gonna close my presets If you're and actually i'm gonna solo it the o clips have multiple sources of audio built within that clip So it's a little hot there so I can come in here and just drop my makeup back a little bit Built within that clip You're gonna want to check this out jump in and resolve. I got to show you something So that's pretty good now If I find it needs a little bit of something here and the mani eq isn't doing it quite the way I want it I can make some adjustments in here if I want or I could just come into my uh, you know Track level eq make a little bit of an adjustment there if I need to you know So I might just check it out real quick and see uh if if there's any changes I want to make we want to use For a given piece of audio. So in this case, I have an audio clip right here Now i'm not showing my video clips because uh, it's got some of the kids in there So we don't want to show that but I got my all right. I think that sounds good We're gonna just go with that for now So now I can come back in here and set my music level a little bit better see how it sounds here And if you know if it if you notice like it's if it seems a little delayed with the audio and how you're hearing It's because i'm recording the screen and well, there are a lot of processing on the computer there, but um But it is all you know synced up. It works out just fine. So just so you know Your video clips have multiple sources of audio built within and you know to fix my playback I might even change this down a half just to see if that'll help a little bit for our playback here While we're actually recording the screen and stuff If your video clips have multiple sources of audio built within that clip All right, so it's still a little loud there I'm gonna drop that back Bring around 18 and the other thing I like to do with my music tracks if I come over back into fairlight I've got a preset to throw on there preset library I've got a preset right here music under dialogue throw them a music track apply So what it does is it just adds a little bit of eq there, right that I've uh, I've talked about before Apparently, I had the channel color different there too. It doesn't really matter. It's fine And then I've got a uh, eq plug in here from waves. That's just spreads out that audio, right? So I've talked about this a lot in a lot of other videos just making some space for that dialogue to live in the middle Spreading out our music a little bit. Here's what that sounds like a little before and after so here's before and then after So this one it doesn't push it out too much but a little bit, you know, so I'm just gonna leave that as it is Jump back into edit tab here If your video clips have multiple sources of audio built within that clip You're gonna want to check this out jumping a resolve. I got to show you something Sometimes when I'm filming a video Okay, so I'm just gonna cut my music track because I'm not gonna want any more of that I faded out, you know, once we get into the tutorial because you guys don't want to hear that So next I'm gonna add on the logo davidsch resolve logo wipe transition. I like that So I'm gonna come to my uh, not my media pool my effects library. We're gonna go transitions. I'm gonna find logo wipe There it is. We're gonna drop that on there. Now I am going to grab the davidsch resolve logo, which I've got in a power bin here under brand assets Logos and icons Change the way it looks here Make them a little smaller All right, there's the one I want now if I can select my transition there. I can open my inspector I got the transition. I'm gonna go custom logo. I don't want the text. So I'm gonna uncheck that Drag my custom logo boom. There we go. Now we should have the davidsch resolve wipe logo Now I also want to add a little sound effect to it because I think it's fun. I'm gonna say add a track I'm gonna say stereo clean up our window here a little bit I'm gonna call this sfx sound effects now I'm gonna use one of the sound effects that I created So I'm gonna come to my media pool again. I have it in a power bin here under sound effects We've got jy sound effects and let's see. I don't know which one we like here. How about this? All right, here's a little whoosh All right, and I know you're thinking like Jay, that doesn't sound so good. I'm gonna show you how we make it sound better So I'm gonna drag that drop it in the timeline Kind of line it up with the start of the transition there Now I got to redo these so then you know, maybe I can make them available for you guys But I'm gonna make it a little bit louder there. I'm gonna watch my meters here to see how loud that is and listen to it Show you something sometimes drag the music down a little Fade it in so we can fade the music out or fade it out. I should say Gotta show you something sometimes when I All right, so I'm gonna bring this here now the trick to oh, I gotta show you something Making this transition sound better is to add some effects to it. So again, I've got a preset for this already I'm gonna come into fairlight Fairlight preset library global track preset and if I scroll down the bottom, I've got sound effects transitions I'm gonna select that apply it to my track and now here's what it sounds like once I add that in Okay, it makes it sound better. I can change the pitch of it if I want Um, you know, you can do really whatever you want to make it sound however you want So in this case, I put on a little pitch a little reverb and that's gonna be good enough You know just for a little little whoosh transition. It sounds a little different from me just making noises in the microphone So let's see what's looking like If your video clips have multiple sources of audio built within that clip You're gonna want to check this out jumping resolve. I got to show you something Sometimes when I'm filming a video. All right, so that's pretty good. I'm gonna make it a little bit louder if I want I'll jump in and resolve. I gotta show you something Sometimes when I'm filming a video and I've got Show you something Sometimes when I'm filming a video and I've got multiple people in the video I'll put a lav mic on each person and then I have that audio go into my camera So that one person's recorded on the left channel one person's recorded on the right channel And in resolve we can select which channel we want to use All right, so I want to add a little zoom in here on uh on the screen recording because it could use it I think in here But you might want to start using it because when I click on it if I come down So i'm just gonna select my clip. I'm gonna add a couple key frames here video Let's make this guy a little can I make this guy a little smaller here? I guess not. All right, I'm gonna add a key frame one two three four Five sounds good. I'm gonna go 1.5 I'm just lining up how I want it looks pretty good And let's just see how it looks really use the file section here But you might want to start using it because when I click on it if I come down to the bottom here We have audio configuration and now I can see the different audio tracks for my particular clip. All right now We're gonna have this go back I'm gonna add a key frame one two three four five and then I'm gonna go Make it a zoom back to one and x and y back to zero There we go Different audio tracks for for my particular clip now Let's say I'm looking in my uh media pool at a clip for example If I just come and open up this guy right here when I have it selected into my media pool and I've got my inspector open I'm in the file tab I can see and preview the different audio tracks that are part of this file So now down here I have a right and left channel which were both recorded separately So if I go in here and just put the little playhead right there and I just hit play Click down here. So there's one person now if I go to the track number two Now remember I don't have uh, or I have my um Screen flow track muted. Um, I'm gonna export it out again So then I'll just unmute it and then only the sounds from the screen recording will be heard I won't have my you know speaking dialogue in there too at the same time. So um, so that just kind of speeds things up too The other channel Now you hear the other person and I've also got one where it's got them combined where they would all be in the same track Now most of the time when I record separately like this, I'm gonna want one person in one track and one person in another track But being able to take a look at the inspector here gives me a quick way to see how many audio tracks are associated with that video clip Do I have more than one? Do I just have one? Sometimes you may have a whole bunch of them So this gives you an option to preview them see which ones you want to use and then when you're clipping your timeline Now one thing I'm not crazy about is I'm kind of off to the side of the frame there when I turn You know this way not a big deal for a quick tip Tuesday Who cares? I'm just gonna I'm just gonna roll with it because uh, you know making youtube vids here sometimes You know done is better than perfect. So All right, so now we're gonna throw uh little tunes at the end here because uh, I like some tunes at the end So i'm gonna try and find some music again. Let's try uh, you know, we'll go um Artlist this time. Artlist has tons of great stuff. Love artlist. Love artlist. Love all these guys. They're all great They're all great So I've got to come out of the sound effects, but go into music artlist and uh, let's just find one and pick one All right, that sounds good to me. I like it. I'm gonna drop that volume back Around minus 23. Let's try that I'm putting it in my music track. We're gonna fade it in You can choose whichever one you want or set it up. However, you might want to do that So I check out my mixer here watch my levels little tip here is really handy when it comes to working with multiple audio tracks In a given video clip. I did that on a recent project. I was on I had two cameras So I think I might lower the music volume just a little bit there That sounds good But I had four tracks of audio between the two cameras So being able to preview it like this just makes it handy in helping you sort out where different things are getting a quick Preview instead of having something in your timeline and then figure it out from there So In the ventures adult night beta and it's right here in the edit tab Sometimes I like to add in just a little zoom in or a little push in and push out just to make it a little more You know interesting So I've got a little preset for that. Um if I come to yeah, my power bins here um and Whoops and I come to zooms. I've got one zoom. It's a um Adjustment clip so I could just drop it on change the length of it however I want and then we've got a little punch in to punch out Drag it in the timeline there we go Audio track working with multiple audio tracks in a given video clip. I did All right, so we're gonna put this here I'm gonna back it up using the period and comma keys place exactly where I want right there now If I just open this up here, you can see what's going on. So all I did was create a few keyframes Um using the inspector, right? So I got a couple keyframes there in the inspector And I can always make this clip longer or shorter Let's see if we need to change it now and uh if we do I'll show you how to do that In a given video clip. I did that on a recent project. I was on I had two cameras But I had four tracks of audio between the two cameras So all right, so let's say I wanted to come to here What I can do is extend my clip and then if I zoom in I can just Click on my keyframe to select it as long as you're in the diamond here and then I can uh use commander Control to click the other one and then I could just slide my keyframes and put them wherever I want them So that way the zoom can be as long as I want right and works out pretty good I'm sure there's better ways to do this I'm sure guys have plugins that like you just drop it you can stretch it and do it automatically But I just do it this way because uh, uh, that's just the way I do it I'm not smart enough like those guys to figure out fusion stuff yet or something So I do that and then it'll just go right back for me Racks of audio between the two cameras So being able to preview it like this just makes it handy in helping you sort out where different things are getting a quick preview So it's we're gonna punch this one in so i'm gonna shrink this up here Because I just want you know that particular clip to zoom in I could zoom the clip I mean it really just depends whatever you want to do, but I'm just gonna do it like this I'm gonna drag this guy in boom done Right here in the edit tab that wraps up this quick tip Tuesday guys And as always if you want to take your so and then I say as always wraps up this quick tip Tuesday guys and as Guys and as always if you want to take Tuesday guys and as always If they guys and as always if Guys and as always if you want to take your audio to the next level Learn the ins and outs of how to work with your so I don't know if on the screen recording here You guys it looks like the the audio and the video aren't synced up That's just like I said before it's just because of the recording the screen and working in resolve and all that stuff But it's synced up fine. It'll work fine in the final video. You could check it out. It's already posted So by the time you see this that's this one's already going to be out But uh, yeah, it's a little a little tricky I'm gonna have to double check to just make sure because even while I'm watching it It's still stuttering a little bit but um or not stuttering but it seems like it's not synced but it is so I just want to mention that again Check out my audio course audio essentials for video editors In DaVinci resolve. I'll link it down below if you're interested check it out So I'm gonna stretch this one out. We're gonna move our keyframes here Looks good. And then since I'm talking about my audio course. I've got a little image here that I'm gonna Drop into the timeline. I've got a couple different sizes here. So I'll just pick one Just drop it on in here With your audio check out my audio course. All right, we're gonna just do a little resize. We can actually A little easier to do this boom Maybe we'll uh Drop it over here. Looks pretty good. Now. I can use a transition to drop it in or whatever. So maybe we'll just do that We'll go effects Uh video transitions. I don't know. What do we want to do here? You pick anything, you know, maybe you want to do a Fallen bounce. I don't know shrink it up a little. I like to make the transitions a little shorter I think sometimes they're a little too long um, so typically I'm gonna Shorten them up a little bit. Let's see Check out my audio course audio essential. All right, maybe that one doesn't look so good short. Maybe I should stretch it back out Say yep, check out my audio course audio essentials for video editors in DaVinci Resolve. I'll link it down below if you're interested check it out. All right guys with All right, and then we'll just stretch it out a little fade it out. That's it. Check it out All right guys with that said I will see you in the next video Peace And then I'm gonna have the music just get a little bit louder as I kind of in the video here Boom two keyframes by holding option or all clicking on the gain line boost it up a little I usually don't like to take the music higher than like, you know minus 10 db Um, I don't know. It's just what I like to do. So all right guys with that said I will see you in the next video peace All right, that's pretty good and then at the end here I'm just going to find a little uh, you know subscribe kind of thing or whatever to throw in there Which I do have a stuff for that. So let me see if I go on my overlays I've got a bunch of different stuff here a lot of assets I get from You know motion array or story blocks or whatever all over the place Um, I got all kinds of stuff. So I'll usually just continue to add to this and you know, I'll just throw in something I think looks kind of cool, right? So here's like a little subscribe thing. That's kind of cool. Um, Let's throw that in there. So I'm going to right click and uh, because if you look at it actually the reason I'm right clicking I should tell you what I'm doing here is because you can see the youtube logo there is like purple So I'm going to right click on there and they need to just update the color space We go rec 709a. So now when I hover on there, it's the right color, right? Because sometimes the color space is a little off with uh, some of the assets you bring in here based on how you have your project Color setting setup, which I have it set up because I shoot and log on my c100. So, um, yeah So that's why that's that way. So I'm just going to drag this guy drop her on in here And uh, yeah, it should work out pretty good. Let's see In the next video So I could fade this in back it up a little bit And that just kind of ends so what I like to do sometimes I'll just take this I'll copy it over I'm going to get rid of the fade and then I'm going to play the clip written in reverse so that it looks like it comes up And then goes down and goes away. So I'll just right click on there. We're going to go to change clip speed reverse change done And then I'll just fade it out a little bit at the end and here's what that looks like and then the music too Um, we'll just you know, it looks like the music's coming down here. Anyway, so I'll just cut it here Delete that fade it out. That's it. We'll call it a day. Let's see I'll link it down below if you're interested check it out. All right guys with that said, I will see you in the next video peace I Make that fade a little longer and that's it And that's it. Uh, I think we're probably in pretty good shape as far as like, you know The initial edit. I mean you can spice it up a little bit But a lot of times with these quick tip Tuesdays my goal is a so I create something every week Although I haven't been great at doing it every week, but it's the idea for me is it's a quick video It's a tip that's going to be helpful for you guys And it gets me making vids and putting out vids, right? Um, just so that I'm consistent, right? Because I'm working on bigger videos, but they take longer and uh, you know, it's nice to have quick wins, you know I'm making quick videos. Um, I'm sure there's even ways to improve this workflow You know, if I'm not filming it, you know, this might take me an hour to do the full edit and all that stuff The last thing I'm going to do here is uh, actually two last things I'm going to do three, I guess if you consider rendering So next let's go to The color page here. So in the color tab here, I like to just edit, you know, all of my talking head Real quick at the same time. So I'm just going to come to one of my clips right click and I'm going to come down to Remote grades, which means I can apply the grade to one clip and then it'll apply to all the clips So I do have a preset for that. I've got a couple going on here. I'll just click hold drag it on Boom, there it is. It puts it on all my clips Then typically I'm going to go to a full screenshot. I'm going to look at my parade a little bit I like to make sure that I'm not really going much above the uh, the 896 line here. So I might make a little bit of an adjustment I can either, you know, bring down my gain a little bit or, you know, adjust my my highlights a little bit there Um, because I find when I get it too close to, you know, above that 986 line, what happens is when I watch it on other devices like a tv, it looks blown out Um, and it doesn't look great. So I typically will bring that back a little bit Um, can even lower the whole exposure and then, you know, bring that back up You know, just little tweaks if I need it, you know, I may not may not even need it And I might just check the white balance too, you know, I can just come over here I select my white balance tool and typically I wear a gray. I'm like a great hoodie shirt kind of guy I'll just click on that. We'll see if it changed at all. I'll do a little undo and redo Made a little cooler. So I'm just going to leave it where it was at So the only nodes that I use is like, you know, a little corrector node in the beginning That works with my color wheels, essentially I use one that creates a little bit of a vignette Not much, but a little bit and then I use one for sharpening And that's pretty much it for my talking head in the studio here. I really don't have to do much The uh, screen recordings. I don't do anything with that. That's good to go. So once the color grading is done I'm going to jump into fair light and now what I'm going to do is check my overall loudness, right? I want to make sure I'm getting close to that minus 14. Love's usually I'm around minus 16. Love's because I don't Want to get too close and you know what it's good enough. So in order to check that what we do is um, make sure I've got my Right here. This guy toggled on my automation. So I see my bus track right here I'm going to make it a little bit bigger because then I can see my loudness history if I turn this on On my main bus. I typically put two things on there. Um And they are waves plugins if I click on the plus the first one is going to be a dynamics and an l1 ultra maximizer stereo. So this is just kind of like um, a limiter slash Booster a little bit between the threshold and the output ceiling So I could come here and just start with uh, they have a preset called mastering Now I know that minus 60 b is going to be too loud. It's going to push it too much So I typically bring this back to like around two and a half or three And that's just going to bring the overall volume of everything in the video up So that's kind of what that's doing and then uh, I like to bring up a meter. So I'm going to go to metering vst I'm sorry metering VST And uh, this guy from waves 2 it's a it's a really great um tool here It's got a lot of different settings in it, but typically what I'm going to do is make sure I've got the youtube option selected So it's going to set, uh, you know, my loudness. Tell me what my levels are. I'm going to hit reset Um, and then I'm also going to let resolve run its own Loudness metering, which is the graph we see down here. So I'm going to make sure in my loudness section of the meter up here I'm going to click that and go to youtube Hit reset start and then I'm just going to play through the video let it get some readings here and see where we're coming in at If your video clips have multiple sources of audio built within that clip You're going to want to check this out jumping to resolve. I got to show you something Sometimes when I'm filming a video and I've got multiple people in the video I'll put a lav mic on each person and then I have that audio go into my camera So that one person's recorded on the left channel one person's recorded on the right channel and all right So that's pretty good. I mean, that's probably close enough. Uh, you know, I don't like to push it too much I think that's probably good if I did want to boost or reduce Uh, the overall loudness level to change my long-term meter here and if I you know zoom in down here We're we're essentially looking at the same thing. We're around, you know, minus 16 here and the longer I play it Obviously the smoother this line is going to get but what I could do is I could either come into my um Ultramaximizer here and I could change my threshold because if I move this up or down it's going to make it louder or quieter like this For a given piece of audio. So in this case, I have an audio so you can see it changes it there Um, so I can adjust that if I want or I could um, if I need to limit it a little bit I could use this right here And this is essentially a limiter. So if I drop it down here's what that sounds like Clip right here now. I'm not showing my video clips because uh, it's got some so I'll leave that around uh minus 0.5 there Um, or I could do it in the meter itself. There's a lot of good tools here. You can you know, boost the gain It's got a true peak limiter on there. So it's not going to let anything exceed That minus 1 db there. So we're not gonna, you know, be too loud Or I can even just come in and adjust it on my main bus right here like this Um, it just depends you can do it however you want. It's gonna kind of accomplish the same thing there for you So, uh, I think my levels are looking good with the settings that we had there So that is that Now we're gonna go ahead and export it out. So in my deliver tab here I've got a preset a lot of presets here because it just speeds up the workflow when you're doing The same thing over and over and over again like we do for youtube here So i'm gonna come to my custom presets hit the drop down. I've got a 1080 to 4k youtube export So you could if you had 4k footage edit your timeline in 1080 then change the timeline back to 4k And uh, and then export the 4k timeline for me. I mean I film in 1080 the timeline's 1080 So I just do the up up scaling I guess you call it at the end here and it works out pretty good It gives me that better vp9 codec on youtube so that my videos look better Um, and I but I don't film them in 4k because it just like takes up way too much space, you know, I'm saying So, uh, that's a lot of hard drives you need so in my preset here Um, you can see I use an mp4 and h.264. I've tried h.265 I don't I don't see a difference in my stuff for youtube. So I just leave it at that resolution We do the 4k the 3840 by 2160 frame rate is what my frame rate is Quality here. I use restrict to 90,000 When i'm doing, you know a 4k size there I do multi pass because uh, I think it's a little bit better And then under like advanced settings and stuff. I don't change any of this stuff. It's all as is Subtitles generally I don't have subtitles. So I don't export them. I don't use them youtube makes them and that's good enough for me for now And the youtube settings here. I don't use this at all. I don't upload directly to youtube I like to uh, export it to my hard drive first and then upload it to youtube You could you know, do this if you wanted to If you've got a lot of chapters and markers sometimes it's convenient to do it this way I just don't do it that way. There's nothing wrong with it. It works fine. Um, I just I just don't do it that way I just you know render it to my hard drive and then I'll upload it to youtube later So, um, I'm gonna actually pick my file location and my name I put my video in my final video folder. I'll name it. Well quick tip tuesday Called source audio channels Hit save and then I've got it all there. I'm gonna add it to the render queue I always get this message because I'm trying to render it out render it out in a higher resolution than the timeline is I just say add and now before I render it out I'm actually going to go back and re-render out my screen recording and when I do that It's automatically going to get replaced in my timeline, right? Because I don't want, you know, my talking head audio in there I only want what was recorded on screen. So then back here in the edit tab I'll make sure that this is not muted. So I'm going to unmute that I'm going to save everything and then we're going to re-export that out and then that's it. Boom. I am done I'll be able to reopen resolve the updated Screen recording is going to load right back up for me automatically because I'm not changing the file name I'm just overwriting the file that I've already got there and That's it. I'm going to render out the video post it up and uh, you know come up with a little thumbnail Sometimes I try to think of the thumbnail first. I know everybody says think of the thumbnail first and the title I don't always do that. Um I'm trying to get into doing that but I'll create a thumbnail for it and um, you know, we'll uh We'll upload it up to youtube and this is going to be out on tuesday for a quick tip tuesday And this is how I put all that together and I don't know how long I've been recording here. Let's see, uh An hour and 20 minutes But I mean if I just did this without filming it and explaining it it goes pretty pretty darn quick Especially for a quick tip tuesday You can bang it out pretty quick. So that's how I make quick tip tuesday if you guys have questions You want more tips and tricks? I don't know drop a comment down below I'm happy to make videos on pretty much anything But there's been some uh interest in longer videos more in depth where you guys can pick up tips along the way See how I do stuff and make videos and stuff like that. So, um, that is how I make a quick tip tuesday And uh, I hope it was helpful. Let me know your thoughts down below as always if you want to learn about your audio Check out my audio course audio essentials for video editors in DaVinci Resolve Um, I think it's awesome. And if you want to learn about audio, it's a great place to start Thank you guys so much for watching I will see you in the next video and if you didn't see the final quick tip tuesday video I'll link it up here. Go check that out. All right. We'll see you guys. Peace
