Oh buddy, I am getting excited because we've got resolve con coming up in a few days here today is Wednesday I'm actually flying out tomorrow out to Oregon We're gonna be meeting up with a bunch of other creators out there and Friday starts resolve con I'm super excited to get out there and just share some DaVinci resolve with you guys I'm gonna be talking some audio stuff. It'll be be a lot of fun I hope you guys are gonna be there, but if you can't make it in person Hopefully you guys can watch online and and get some great information from all of the awesome creators that are presenting But I just thought I'd make a quick video here and give you guys a little update this summer has been super busy for me super crazy and Not because I've got a lot of videos I'm working on because you may have noticed I've been a little slow on posting some videos But I've been on full-time dad duty because when summer comes all the munchkins are home And we got a lot of things going on so for me and YouTube here Video making the summer is kind of like the slow time for me But as soon as everybody gets back in school and after resolve con here We're gonna be cranking back to making videos and trying to get something out You know more often once a week may bring back some quick tip Tuesdays and stuff, but Yeah, this summer has been it's been a lot busier than I expected Also spent a lot of time working on the resolve con stuff just putting together everything I want to put together a real good file that you know is easy for you guys to follow along with and stuff So yeah, that's that's kind of what's been going on. I just got back from Vacation we had a soccer tournament then Right from there went down to Tennessee had an awesome family vacation there and then back for a few days And then we're heading out to resolve con so I'm hoping to you know see you guys there But we'll see and now I'm just trying to get packed up trying to figure out what am I gonna bring? What do I need so I just thought hey, that's just make a little video here I'm gonna I'm just gonna share what I'm gonna bring first thing this guy right here the 2470 We're gonna bring this I'm gonna bring my 5d mark 4 and the 16 to 35 that's on there right now Because I'm actually gonna be photographing the event so you know a lot of people do do the video and all that obviously and I think I'm gonna vlog it a little bit too maybe But I offered to take pictures because nobody was around to take pictures and I did it last year worked out great So I was like hey, I could do it again this year take some pictures for everybody, you know But if I do vlog it, I actually had a thought here What do you guys think about this now? I would love to vlog it on my 5d mark 4, but the thing is big It's heavy and you know what I thought I thought I'd actually instead of doing that I'm gonna vlog it on my GoPro I did that last year and it worked out really good surprisingly because it's so little the audio is reasonable I mean, it's not as good as if I throw a microphone my 5d mark 4 but still reasonable and The GoPro is just so small and so easy to use and it's good enough. I don't got to worry about focus and exposure and all that I can just run and gun with this thing right? It's a GoPro, but who cares, you know It get some footage and then at least it'll give me an opportunity to um, you know edit together a different kind of video and if you guys want to check it out you can check it out If not, it's cool too. No worries. No worries. So so yeah, so I got to get this packed up. I got to Start charging everything up. I got you know memory cards over here We got all our cards here that we're working on gotta get all that stuff together We've got to round up all of my lenses I'm going to be bringing my old trusty 2015 MacBook Pro right here. So that way I could work on some pictures, you know In between downtime in the evenings or whatever try and get some stuff done for For casing his crew that way. We've got some pictures Gonna try and post lots of images along the way some from my cell phone some from the 5d mark 4 right here I'm also gonna take a little look through my gear cabinet back here and see What else do I need to bring? You know what else I need is this guy right here Oh the 2470 this guy has got to be Gotta change my hands here. This guy has got to be my favorite lens although it weighs a ton Um, I love this lens. This thing is awesome and for shooting sports. I got a 1.4 converter for it works out pretty good That's uh, it does a good job. Although now that uh, my one dollar is moving up the plane on the big fields I might have to invest in some longer glass than the 70 200 even with that 1.4 converter. So um, they're gonna pack that up And uh, just kind of look through the rest of my my gear closet back here charge up all the batteries You know all that kind of stuff But uh, trying to get ready pack up pack up everything I need Head off to resolve con here. Dude. I'm super excited about resolve con this year. It's just such a great event So much fun, you know, thanks kasey to putting all this together a lot of fun Good time. I hope you guys are gonna be there online and in person and stuff Um, but yeah, I just you know, it's gonna it's gonna be a good time looking really looking forward to it In other news check this out I've had these sony headphones sony mdr v6 headphones since 2002 so I've been using these guys for over 20 years And the right side just stopped working on me. Oh man. I'm so bummed. I love these headphones. They're fantastic Back when I bought them they're like 80 bucks And they discontinued them I think in 2020 and um, you can't even find them anymore Well, I should take that back you can find them but people want like a few hundred bucks for them Which they're probably not worth a few hundred bucks, but sound quality these things were awesome I'm really bummed that uh that they they they kind of stopped working on me But what I think I'm gonna do in which I have already started doing is reaching out to Several manufacturers and seeing if I can round up a bunch of different pairs of headphones So that we can test them out and you can see or I can share How they're different when we're editing our audio, right? Because if I edit on these it's gonna sound drastically different than if I edit on these these mackey headphones that are a little bit cheaper, right? Big sound difference in these two Um, so I'm kind of curious to see with other brands what kind of audio editing experience I can get With their headphones, so Stay tuned for that this fall. I'm going to be having a video about that. Hopefully, um, assuming I can round up some headphones Worst case I'll go purchase everything myself. We could we could do it that way too always unbiased though You know, I'm gonna give you my honest thoughts on anything that I try out because That's what I would want from any of you guys or anybody that I watch videos on right? Just give me your honest opinion. I don't care if you got it for free I don't care if you paid for just give me your honest opinion and tell me what you think about whatever it is Uh, so that was a bummer that my headphones died not not too happy about that, but um What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? You know things happen and you know, it's probably time for an upgrade anyway But uh, yeah, that's where I'm at today I just want to make a quick update video for you guys and just kind of let you know that I've been super busy this summer with all the dad stuff and uh, taking care of the munchkins and everything and Last month here has been real busy with some travel and everything. Um, but yeah, so It comes September I'm playing a really hit the ground running here and trying to get some uh, some good videos out for you guys I'm gonna be talking about a lot of um different things that I might not have made videos about before and kind of revisiting some Older videos that I think are important that you know, people might just not look for you know, or they might not find Or they might not realize, uh, you know something that's important So I think i'm gonna take a look at my back catalog and see what has done Well, and then kind of update that too for you know resolve 18.5 0.1, which I think is the most current version there Um, oh and another thing if any of you guys are uh, gonna be attending um, I think it's called the build expo b i l d at the jacob javits center in new york city on september 6th and September 7th, I'm gonna try and get there and check it out. I already registered. I really want to um Get there and be able to just kind of browse around some new gear check out some sessions there Um, it's close to me. So it's one that's easy for me to get to I did check out the list of speakers There are some great people there um that I'm really looking forward to hearing From and just kind of hearing their talks and jerry poland's gonna be there I've been watching him since he started on youtube long long time ago and he's not too far from he's down in philly So, you know, not too far never met him But um, we'd love to see his talk and there's a bunch of other people on that list too.
