Yo, yo, DaVinci Resolve 18 is out, we gotta go get this installed. Let's go. Alright, don't judge, we're running down to the studio to check this out, man. It's a mess down here. Don't judge. Yo, yo, I don't know if you guys are as psyched as I am for DaVinci Resolve 18 here, but dude, I love when they come out with updates. There's so much awesome stuff. And now we're going to be talking about how do we upgrade to DaVinci Resolve 18? There's a few things you need to know and think about before you go ahead and upgrade. First of all, I'm making this on April 19th, so it's still in beta and there may be bugs in there. So if you're in the middle of a project, don't upgrade, save yourself the trouble just in case. Don't upgrade, just wait until you finish that project. That's the first thing. Don't upgrade in the middle of a project. The second thing you want to think about is backing up your database. So when you upgrade to DaVinci Resolve 18, you're going to need to upgrade your database. So you want to have a backup of your current database in DaVinci Resolve 17 before you install 18, you load it up because it's going to upgrade that database and you can't go backwards with it. So you want to back up your database. I'm always talking about backing up. Super important. I'm going to show you how to do that in a minute here. And then we're going to get into installing DaVinci Resolve 18 on my M1 Mac Mini here. Super excited with all these changes. They have some awesome stuff in here. And I'm just really excited to dive into it, start learning about what they got, the new features, share them with you guys so then you don't got to dig through the book and do all the boring stuff. I'll do that for you because I like that stuff nerdy like that. But let's look where we download DaVinci Resolve 18. We're going to download it and then we're going to go ahead and I'm going to show you how to back up your database and how to get DaVinci Resolve 18 installed on your computer. All right, I got the Blackmagic Design website open. So where do we download DaVinci Resolve 18? Just go to their website. You see it right up here in the top bar, blackmagicdesign.com. And the easiest way, if you already have Resolve on your machine, the way that I do it is I come up here to the support tab and it brings you to the support center under Select the Product Family. I'm going to go ahead and click DaVinci Resolve Infusion Software. Scroll down a little bit. Boom, latest downloads right here. Now you can see we've got the DaVinci Resolve 18 public beta. This is going to be your free version. That's the one you want to choose if you've got the free version. Now, if you're like me or anybody who has Studio, you're going to want to download the Studio version. So right below that we see right here DaVinci Resolve Studio 18 public beta. Now real quick about the betas. I've downloaded every beta that they've released since 15, I think. Every time they release a beta, I download it, I try it. For me on my Mac system here, most of the time I don't have any problems. Everything works out all right. You may run into little bugs and quirks since it is a beta. So keep that in mind. It's a beta. So I just want to put that out there on the Mac system. It seems to work pretty well. And even in the last bunch of one, I mean, there's no crashing or anything. So just a little bit of my experience there with the betas. Now, let's go ahead and I'm going to download the Mac OS X here. And once you click on it, it's going to bring up this window here. You do need your serial number. So go find that if you don't have it. Find that, look it up and then put in all your information here and then you're just going to go ahead and click Register and Download. Oh, and real quick, if you just want to download it, you can go ahead and hit just download only here. I didn't see that in the beginning, but you can click that if you want. Otherwise, I'm just going to register and download it. Once you hit download, you should see your download start. If not, click on this little thing right here and you should be good to go. Should get downloaded, then you can install the Venture Resolve 18. But before we do that, there's a few things you want to do. So do not install it yet. Download it. Don't install it yet. We're actually going to go back up our database first. Highly recommend that you do this. Super important. Now, I like to back up just the database as a whole because it includes all your projects. So for me, I think that's good enough. You can export your projects individually if you want to. For me, I don't feel the need to do that, but the option is there. You can do that if you want to. So looking at the screen here, I opened the Venture Resolve 17. My project manager comes up. I want to back up my database right here. My local database, that's what I want to back up. So all I'm going to do is come up here to the top and this first icon here says backup. I'm just going to go ahead and click on that. And then it's going to bring up your Finder window or your Explorer window, depending on whether you're on PC or Mac. Find a location where you want to save that backup. And for me, I like to name it with the date in the beginning just so I can keep tracking my backups. So, 2004, what is today? I said the 19th underscore local resolve database backup. And just going to hit save. And now it might take a little time depending on how big your database is. So my database, I'm going to hit back up here. My database, I guess, I mean, I got a lot of projects in it. A couple of years worth of YouTube videos, some client work. So I got a lot of stuff in there, but I'm going to back it up here. And then I did actually think about just starting a new database here in resolve 18, just to start with a clean slate, but then maybe I got to jump back and forth. I don't know. I got to figure that out. I'm for now, I'm just going to upgrade this database so I can access all my assets because I would want at least to have all this database in there. So I can go grab stuff from projects if I need to. At the same time, I can also just create another database to kind of start fresh and, you know, just work from there. But it is nice to be able to copy things back and forth between projects. Can always use power bins, power bins, right? Now I do have another database that I started a long time ago. I keep backing it up over time. I don't really use it, but, you know, I figured I'd like backing up stuff because hey, what if, right? What if? So once this database is done backing up, I'm going to go ahead. Oh, there we go. Database fully backed up or backed up successfully. I'm going to hit OK. And then I'm going to come to my other database here and I'm going to back that one up as well. And then we should be good to go. So let me do that real quick and we'll be right back. So just another little bit of info here, this other database here that says Drobo 5DT that I'm opening. It's taken a little while because I haven't opened it in a while, but it's also on an external hard drive, which is technically not what you want to do. Most of the time you want to keep your database on your internal hard drive. So just something to keep in mind, although with Resolve 18, they have all this collaboration stuff and cloud stuff, which is super awesome. I mean, I don't know that it's going to pertain for me all that much, at least at this point, so maybe we start doing some more collabs with other YouTubers and stuff. That would be fun, but it's a really awesome feature to have. So we're going to be jumping into that. I'm going to learn about that a little bit too. But all right. So we have our database open here. I'm going to go ahead and back this one up and then we're going to be done here. We should be backed up. Good to go. And we're going to install the Venture Resolve 18. All right. So we are all backed up here. I double checked that the files are there, the backup files are there. And we should be good to go. I also have offsite backup from Backblaze and I've got a time machine backing up my computer, so I've got lots of backups and you should too. So if you need more info about that, I got videos on that. Backblaze is awesome, by the way, link in the description. Not sponsored, but just want to give you guys the heads up. All right. Now we're good to go. We're backed up and all our files are all set. So now let's get into installing DaVinci Resolve 18. So I'm just going to go ahead and close my project manager here. And we're good to go on this. We're downloaded. So I'm going to come on over here to my downloads folder. I've got DaVinci Resolve 18 studio. I'm going to double click that on the Mac here. It's going to go ahead and open that up. And then we're going to get to installing resolve. Now, if you have presets and you've got different things already brought into resolve, you know, other assets that you might use, it should carry all that over into 18. You shouldn't have to reimport things or move things or copy things. It should import all that for you. So I do have some presets and stuff set up. We'll check that as soon as we get it installed here. So just keep that in mind. You should be good to go with whatever you have already installed there in resolve 17. So here is the manual I was talking about. I always drag it, leave it on my desktop because I refer to it often. It helps me answer your guys questions, help me learn stuff. It's awesome. So save that, drop it on your desktop or whatever, so you can always go check it out. Now I'm going to go ahead and install resolve 18. Now, if you're on a Windows machine, it may look a little bit different. It's probably going to be pretty similar, but obviously I'm doing it on a Mac here. So Windows is going to be similar and just, you know, kind of follow along with as you would install any program. So here we go. Install DaVinci Resolve. I like this. Okay. Great. Read me. Looks good. Now I like to save these because it tells me all the new features kind of up front here. So I'm also just going to save that to my, my desktop here. I'm going to call it DR 18 and I'll just save that on my desktop. I'm going to go ahead and click continue license continue. Yep. I agree. Cause if you don't agree, you can install it. All right. So agree. I'm going to leave the default location. Five gigs. This thing's getting big. I think the last one was only three gigs. All right. Install password. Boom. Configuring files, writing files, doing its thing, getting this guy installed. And we should be good to go. Here in a minute. All right. Installation was successful. Awesome. Close that. Move it to the trash. I'm going to close all this and we're going to go ahead and fire up DaVinci Resolve. All right. When I first start up resolve, keep in mind, sometimes it may take a little bit longer for that initial load to happen. I've seen that before. Not that it takes a crazy amount of time, but a little bit longer. So here's what's new in DaVinci Resolve. We got the cloud cloud. We got the cloud collaboration cloud collaboration. We've got enhanced subtitles. So we'll be making videos about that. It's got a neural engine support for the M1 Pro and the M1. So I'm on an M1 Mac mini. So I'm really looking forward to see how that works out. Depth mats. That's awesome. Some great features there. Some simplified proxy workflow. That's pretty sweet. If you use proxies, thankfully, I don't got to use them too much. But if you do, there's things there to help you out. Object mask. This is really cool looking at the examples that they had in the presentation that they did yesterday. Really cool. Really looking forward to trying that. I couldn't believe how good that stuff worked, man. This is fantastic. And then we've got surface tracking overlays. The thing with the shirt, how the shirts move in and you can track on there. I do sweet, man. Sweet. I'm just hoping that this Mac mini has got the power to be able to do these things. So there you go. That's some of the new stuff quit real quick there. I'm going to go ahead and hit continue. And we're going to get this guy installed all the way here. Actually, not in solve. We're going to get it started up. Great. You're up to speed before jumping into a project. Let's make sure you are all set up. So go ahead and hit start. Now we're doing this for the first time together here. I haven't done it before yet. So here we go. DaVinci Resolve Studio 18 public beta. All right. So like we talked about, you have to upgrade your database, which is why it's so important that you backed it up first upgrade project library. We recommend you back up your existing projects in the library before upgrading. You can't undo this selection. Let me repeat that. You cannot undo the upgrade to your database. So if you want to go back to 17, but you upgraded your database, your S.O. Well, you had a luck. Okay. So you can, I think if I hit cancel here, you could probably back it up right here, but I recommend you do it before you even install DaVinci Resolve 18. So we're good to go. I got my local database selected here. I'm going to go ahead and upgrade this database and hit upgrade. And it may take a little bit of time for resolve to upgrade that database. I don't know. We're going to watch it here and find out now while we're waiting here. I'm just checking out the window here. We've got a network tab. We've got the cloud tab, which is pretty interesting. I know they simplified some of the buttons. I think for, what was it for, for backing up or loading or something? I guess we'll see it once it loads up here. A lot of improvements here in DaVinci Resolve 18. All right. Let's speed through this and get this database opened up because you're probably tired of hearing me babble here. Right. But real quick, if you're liking this video, give it a thumbs up for me. Subscribe to the channel. If you want to know everything DaVinci Resolve 16, 17, 18, majorly on 18, we're going to be making tons of videos here about all the new features, new things, a lot of audio stuff. We got edit page stuff, color page stuff, a lot of good stuff. So subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and stay tuned so that you can learn about all these new features here in DaVinci Resolve 18. All right. Looks like my database opened up good here. Let's just open up a project and see what we got. I'm going to open up this guy. My EQ presets volume two coming out soon. If you guys are interested in EQ presets, definitely stay tuned. And actually in DaVinci Resolve 18 here, they actually have some EQ presets built in about time they did that. That's pretty sweet. But I've also got some that you can go purchase if you want to help support my channel. So I'm just going to select this project here. Gonna double click it because I don't see the little project open button anymore. See, I can change the way I view things here. Let's see what's this. Okay. Look at this. I can move and copy around projects. That's pretty cool. Not what I wanted to do, but looks like the open button is not here. So I'm just going to double click the project. There we go. It's going to fire it right up for me. So we are up and running. The project is good. I am super excited to get going here in DaVinci Resolve 18. Now let's just check and see if some of those presets and things carried over from DaVinci Resolve 17 like I talked about earlier. So I do have a few transition effects that I use all the time. So I've got presets, only two of them here, nothing fancy. I have a slide up and a slide down 12 frames. All right. So those are there. No problem. Those presets carried over. Let's jump into Fairlight because I do have the EQ presets and let's go into Fairlight. I can't get my presets library. Let me just make a timeline here real quick. Jump back here into Fairlight. We're going to go preset library equalizer presets. All right. Yep. So I've got them all there. There's my pack two that's going to be coming out soon. So if you want to help support the channel, you need a little EQ help. You can check those out. I'll have a video all about them. So those are there. I do have some global presets, global track presets. There you go. The Sennheiser MKE 600 up here using that guy all the time. So it looks like the presets that I have all carried through. I don't really have many fusion ones, maybe a couple, but nothing fancy. So these are the main ones that I use for now, but they did carry through. One other thing, let's check our power bins and make sure that that carried through. I've got all my assets here. Master power bins. Let's go graphics. OK, so they all carried through. Looks like, yep, there it is. We've got some things going on in there. I can see things coming through just fine. Some countdowns. All right, so everything in the power bins appears to be OK. Here's to be intact. I do have my hard drive connected with all that stuff on there. So everything carried over from version 17 into version 18. Two thumbs up, black magic design, saving us some work. We don't have to go in and save our presets and all that kind of stuff. But you should be backing those things up. You're not sure where they are. Maybe I'll make a little video about it. I do have some freebies that I give away that shows where the file pass for all these things are. So you can check out my Shopify page, pick up on them freebies if you want. But looks like everything is good to go here. I got to say, I'm super excited to get working here in DaVinci Resolve 18. Black magic design. We really appreciate all the hard work that you guys put in on this program for us at such an affordable price. There's just so much here that we love that we enjoy using.
