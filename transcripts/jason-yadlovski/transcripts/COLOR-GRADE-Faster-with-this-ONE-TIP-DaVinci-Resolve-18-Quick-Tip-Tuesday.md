Guys, what's happening? Welcome to Quick Tip Tuesday. Today, I've got a tip for you that is going to really help speed up your workflow when you're color grading your footage. I've been using this lately. It works great. It's fast. Let's jump into Resolve and I'm going to show you how it works. Alright, so we're in DaVinci Resolve here. I have a project that I've already edited. I've cut it up. And now I'm ready to go ahead and color grade it. And what I have is an angle for my intro shot, which you see on the screen here. And then I have a second angle that is me at my desk here in this kind of angle that we've got right here working through the tutorial. Now let's jump into the color tab right here at the bottom, little color wheel, jump in color tab. Now, typically what you might do is go through each one of your clips and you might jump on a clip and I might come in here and add some nodes and do some color grading. And I could copy that from clip to clip to clip, but there's a quicker way to do that and that is using remote grades. So if I come and select my clip and I right click on it, I can come down to this option right here, use remote grades. Now, when I do that and you look at the clips that I have here, all of these cuts are from the same clip for my camera, right? So instead of having to create a grade in here and copy it to all of the other cuts that I made, right, along my timeline, what I can do is just use the remote grades and I'm going to drag and drop on my little node tree here that I use for my videos. And now what do you notice here? All these little ones that have this little icon here are using a remote grade, which means I can color grade just one clip and it's going to apply to all of the other cuts of that particular clip. So now you can see all these clips right here, they all have the same color grade to it because I'm using a remote grade, which means just do the color grade on one clip and apply that to all of the other cuts of that same clip. So if I move ahead a little bit here, for example, I've got the angle of me at my desk, which is this right here, right? Down over here. Now I can do the same thing. You can see I've already got the remote grade set because it's got that little pink icon there. But if I turn it off, I right click on it, go back to use local grades. Now you can see each one of these clips, I will have to grade individually versus being able to do it once and then it's all done. So again, just right click on it, come on down to use remote grades. And now I can just go ahead, I'm going to open up my little power grades here and drop on my little node tree. And now you can see it's applied to all of these clips. So no matter what clip I go to, this little one of me right here in the corner, it's color graded and saves a ton of time when I only have to do it one time. So if you make videos like I do here, you've got one angle, one shot, but you've got a lot of cuts of that one particular clip. Use the remote grades because it's going to save you a lot of time. So there you go. Using remote grades here in the color tab really speeds up your workflow. If you've got the same angle and you need to apply the same grade to a whole bunch of clips there, do it once, use the remote grades. It works out really well. I've been using it and it's pretty much awesome. So thank you guys for joining me for this Quick Tip Tuesday. You want to see more Quick Tip Tuesdays? I know I've been out of the loop a little bit doing the Quick Tip Tuesdays, but maybe I should get back into doing that a little bit more. Also got some more long form content that I want to get out there for you guys. But yeah, we will get to all that soon. But thank you guys for tuning in for this one. And I look forward to seeing you in the next one. Peace.
