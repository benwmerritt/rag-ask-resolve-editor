What's happening guys, we're back for another video on the channel. Today we're talking DaVinci Resolve 18 EQ updates. We're gonna get in here and what I really wanna do is show you guys these new presets that they have. They added in just a few of them, not too many, but I want you to hear the before and the after just hear what they sound like when we apply them as well as let you hear what it sounds like when I create my own EQ preset for a couple sample clips that I have here. If you're gonna use one audio tool, I'm telling you, EQ is the one you wanna start with. It's not as hard as you might think. Let's jump in and check out these presets and see how they sound on some real world clips here. So I'm in DaVinci Resolve Fairlight and we are gonna get going here in the EQ. So where do we find the EQ? First of all, like I said, make sure you're in Fairlight. You wanna have your mixer open, which is right at the top here, open up the mixer and in our mixer you can scroll down and you see we've got the EQ section right here. So you can go ahead and start by double clicking your EQ and that's gonna open it up for us. Now let's apply a preset. So the first one I'm gonna do is Dialog Clean at High. When I look in the EQ here, we're gonna click on this little drop down menu and right here we have Dialog Clean at High End. So I'm gonna go ahead and click on that. Now we can see the kind of curve that we get or the different frequency changes that we get I should say here in the EQ. So that is how you are gonna apply each one of these effects. Now this is on track one, so that's the effect that I want there. Now if I click on the EQ for track two, I'm gonna double click it and it'll just bring it up in the same window here, which is pretty sweet, right? It's always done that, that's nothing new. But just for ease of jumping around. Now let's go ahead and apply another EQ preset. So the second one here I'm gonna come down, I'm gonna do Dialog Mail Lab Finisher. So this is gonna be how you're gonna apply any one of these presets, whether it's the ones that DaVinci Resolve Blackmagic Design has made for you or if you decided to apply or purchase my EQ presets, gotta pack one, link in the description below. I got pack two coming out soon, that's gonna be an EQ modifier, kinda help boost your base, you know, do you need more clarity, that's gonna be pack two coming out soon if you're interested in that. But this is how you're gonna apply any one of the effects. So I just go ahead and click Dialog Mail Lab Finisher, boom we can see the different frequency changes that are made here. So I'm gonna go ahead and update that and I'm gonna play through my clips here. So if I close my EQ you can see up here, it's me in my kitchen filming on my 5D Mark 4 with an on-camera microphone, a situation that a lot of you guys are probably in. Now one thing that is gonna help you hear these changes a little bit better is a good pair of headphones or maybe some monitor speakers. Now if you only have say laptop speakers, you should be able to hear a different still but you're really gonna notice it a lot more if you've got some good headphones or good speakers, something like that. So something to keep in mind, and actually I think down the road I'm gonna be making a video about different kinds of headphones, what it sounds like when you're editing, because it all makes a difference. But anyway, let's get into what these EQ presets sound like, go ahead roll that tape. Alright here we go, we're testing out the EQ presets here in DaVinci Resolve 18. Got the 5D Mark 4 here on top, I've got a shotgun mic, it is a Ceremonic V-Mic 5 Pro, so that's what we're using for the audio here. What you're hearing now is the Dialog Clean Ad High End, that's the preset you're hearing right now. Now if we go ahead and change that, I'm gonna change that to Dialog Mail Lab Finisher, and actually I may try throwing in a lav mic in here to throw that on there too, but just to see what it sounds like with an on-camera mic, this is what you get for that preset. The next preset that I got here is Dialog Mail, hence I'm a male, so I'm using the Dialog Mail preset, this is what it sounds like if you're gonna go ahead and apply that preset. There is a female lav mic fixer, and I'm gonna try that out, this is what it sounds like on my voice, just so you can hear the difference here, but I'll also throw in a female voice using a lav mic, so we can see what that sounds like. And then now here is no EQ, this is just straight at the camera, no EQ on here, that's what it sounds like. Alright, so now I got on the lav mic right here, and you're hearing the Dialog Mail Lab Finisher preset. So this is what it sounds like when you actually use it on a lav mic, now this is a really pretty high end lav mic setup that I've got here, we're gonna actually be making a video about that later on, but here's what it sounds like with that preset applied. Now we're gonna roll into a female lav mic, so my wife has a little side business here, Shameless Plug for her, if you guys need some cleaning products, we got this Norex stuff here, due to use it all the time, it's awesome. But here's a little clip from a video I made for her for her little side business, where she was wearing a lav mic, and I'm gonna apply the Dialog Female Lav Mic Fixer EQ onto that clip, so Shameless Plug for my wife, I'll leave a link in the description below, you wanna go check out some of the Norex stuff, I'm telling you it's good stuff, I use it all the time, so let's go ahead and roll that tape. Back in March I got introduced to some products, and what these products are, are they are cleaning products that don't require any chemicals. I watched a couple videos and I was like, oh okay, that seems interesting, so I purchased a couple products, and you see here are some of the products I purchased, and I've been using them now for a while, and I really just fell in love with them, I think that they clean really well, and I don't have to worry about using all the chemicals all the time, and I still feel like everything is really clean. I started out with the kitchen cloths, which I think are probably one of my favorites, I use these on a daily basis, and then I also purchased their environmental cloth, which is their staple product that you can use on pretty much anything and everything, and to go with that I got a window cloth, the salves kind of clean windows, use it with the environmental cloth, and then also purchased a dusting mitt, got a lot of dusting around in my house, so I figured let's give it a shot, something a little bit different than my typical dusters that I use, so I'm really excited to share with you guys a little bit about these and how they work and how I use them just to see if there's any interest, knowing that these are a lot safer than using chemicals on your counters and surfaces all the time, and not to mention they clean really well, so hopefully you can see that in some of the videos I'm showing you, and you have just as much interest as I do. Thanks, bye! And finally, if I was going to edit my own EQ on this particular microphone, this camera, this room, there's a little echo going on here, I don't know if you guys can hear that, this is how I would edit it, changing the EQ and making it sound what I think sounds the best that I can, and finally I'm going to play a little bit of music here, I'm going to have no EQ applied, and then as the music's playing, I'll pop it up on the bottom of the screen down here, I'm going to turn on the music, I'm looking here at what it's called, Music Master Top End Boost, so that's going to boost some clarity to your music track, so let's go ahead and roll that music, going to do it with no EQ, and then I'm going to turn it on, I'll mark it on the bottom of the screen when that happens, so check this out. Alright guys, so EQ presets, the ones they included here in DaVinci Resolve 18, they're pretty sweet, at least they gave us something to work with, I mean they really should have done that a long time ago in my opinion, at least give you guys somewhere to start if you don't want to get in there to nitty-gritty and really learn some EQ, but if you do want to learn some EQ, click a video up over here, my EQ crash course that's going to help you out, teach you everything you need to know about some EQ. Alright guys, thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next one, more DaVinci Resolve 18 stuff. Alright, see ya!
