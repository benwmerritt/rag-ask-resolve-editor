All right guys, I got a problem here with voiceovers that I've been having for days and taking me days to figure out What is going on here? I got some new microphones here that I've been trying to test out and when I go to do a voiceover and resolve It just doesn't record it comes out all cracked and popping and just just take a listen Here's what it sounds like when I try to record a voiceover into DaVinci resolve. I are my track to record It's just all I'm a track to the monitoring It doesn't come out good So I've been spending days trying to figure out what is going on here. I've tried all different settings I've tried repatching I checked the sample rates I checked pretty much everything that I can think of and I've had this problem since I updated from DaVinci Updated to actually I should say DaVinci resolve 17.4.6 and all of a sudden on my M1 Mac mini I started having this problem I couldn't record any voiceovers unless I went back to the fixed bust setup and I tried new buses I tried everything. I didn't know what was going on finally after days of trying different things I figured it out. Let's jump in resolve I'm going to show you exactly what setting you need to change to get it to work right and then I'm going to give you some Other tips and tricks too if you're having problems with your voiceovers trying to get the audio into resolve It's not working. I'm going to just show you the things that I would check in order to try and get everything going good here So jumping in resolve. Let's check this out. So like I said when it comes down to it, I checked sample rates I checked everything here is the one setting you need to go and change go into DaVinci resolve go into preferences That's going to bring up your preferences here. You want to be on the system side come to your video and audio I slash oh and This is one of the things that you definitely want to check if you're having problems You want to make sure your input device is your microphone, right? Make sure you got the microphone selected But what I found was when this record buffer size right here is set to zero It doesn't work if for me it won't record it sounds old garbled up and and like garbage and it just doesn't record good So all you have to do is change this by default in previous versions from what I've seen This defaults to five now. I've tried every number from one through eight I don't notice a difference when I'm recording But when I change it back to five or eight or whatever a different number then I save my settings Come back into resolve here. I'm gonna arm my track to record throw my headphones And now I can hear myself just fine in the monitoring and I'm gonna mute the monitoring Just so when I record here now you're hearing right in resolve here It should be coming through just fine. So that should be working. Okay, so that record buffer is huge And I don't know why that was causing a problem I don't know why it changed in the latest update of DaVinci resolve now What's interesting is on my MacBook Pro? I plugged in all my microphones tried it out and that latency didn't change It was fine the update worked fine there So I don't know what's up with that glitch But man it drove me nuts for days until I figured out that little setting there was preventing me from being able to record directly into resolve So if you're having problems, it sounds all garbled up and like like junk like that like you heard it I mean you heard what it sounds like it sounds like that come in here adjust that record buffer size and see if it helps I mean hopefully that'll help you so that was my main issue why I couldn't record directly into resolve here now Let's talk about a few other issues that you might run into if you're getting no Waveforms your audio isn't coming through you can't find your microphone Here are the couple things that I always tell people to check to make sure that everything is set up good so that you can record your voice Over into DaVinci resolve let's jump back and resolve check it out So like I already mentioned you want to have your input device selected as your microphone, right? Make sure you got your microphone selected now you want to save it But you may need to restart resolve because sometimes I have found that you know resolve just doesn't pick up that change You know so for whatever reason if you're not seeing your microphone, you know Once you set it as your input device here restart resolve try it again and make sure on your system You have your computer set to use your microphone as your input That's another huge one that I think people miss is make sure your system is set to use your microphone as your input Make sure resolve is set to use the microphone as your input and then you want to go ahead and save it and while you're here Check that record buffer size man because it drove me insane. I was like what is going on? It worked fine before this and you want to make sure you patch your microphone Improperly this is probably another thing that people run into issues with now if you don't see it in your patch settings Restart resolve sometimes you got to restart. I don't know why I mean generally I don't have to but you know sometimes people do have to so fair light come on down to patch input output Bring up your patch settings. Make sure you've got audio input selected on this side on your destination side You want track input now? I have a mono track, so I just have audio one right here if they're not patch It's gonna look like this. It's not gonna say anything right? Definitely check both of them on and then come on down and hit patch now This is gonna make sure that your microphone is patched to resolve boom They should be talking together and you should be good to go so you can go ahead and close that window Now you're like, I don't see any meters moving nothing's happening. I hit record nothing happens. I don't know what's going on There's no green line. What do I do? So here's what you got to do you got to make sure you arm your track to record So in your track you have the R right here record you got to turn it on you know turn it on it ain't gonna work Okay, you got to turn it on you got to arm the track to record now I've arm my track to record and you might have noticed before you saw my meters moving or in my other videos You the meters moving you're like hey my meters aren't moving. What do I do? So here's why your meters aren't moving a you're not recording yet But B if we come up to the Fairlight menu come on down to input monitor style Now input monitor style is gonna tell you how do I hear or monitor my recording? So you've got options here you can hear it only on the input you can do it on auto Which means in my case generally it you hear it all the time. So if I turn on auto, I'll hear it in my headphones now I'll hear it when I record it'll pretty much be like constant monitoring Through my microphone you've got when you record so only when you're recording You've got mute which turns it all off. So you don't hear any monitoring at all Maybe you're getting feedback from your speakers. You don't have headphones Whatever the case might be you can use mute and that's just gonna mute everything so you don't hear any any Any of your recording while you're recording it or even before you hit record And then you got this last one here called repro and I'm gonna read it to you I never use it, but it says while you're recording you only hear what's been recorded Played from the track. So in other words, you're not listening to the input live You're just reviewing what's already been recorded. So I never use that one, but it's there if you want to try that out So by selecting one of those options, you're gonna be able to hear yourself or monitor yourself or not It's up to you But before you even hit record you have the option to be able to hear yourself or not It's up to you depending on which one of these options you pick now once you are ready to record your armed The track is ready to go then you're gonna come up here and hit this record button right here And it's gonna be recording now you might notice it looks like a flat line, right? It looks like I'm not actually recording anything and that could be due to your input monitor settings What did I have it out here by default? Mute so it's muted so I wouldn't hear anything anyway if I come back to auto Then now you can see them there But if I stop the recording boom all my waveforms are there everything worked out fine no issues here So turn off my track to record like through it looks like I'm not actually there you go There you go, you can hear it just fine no problems now for some reason some people run into this situation where if I play through my track here I'm just gonna mute the audio and resolve here, but I played through the track. We see audio ones moving bus one meter Is it moving? What do I do? It's not moving. I can't hear anything So what you want to do is make sure that your audio one track here is getting sent to your bus in this case for whatever reason It's not getting sent so again click on that plus and we want to go bus one boom now if I play through You can see both our bus one and our audio one tracks are getting our audio We're good to go. You should be able to hear it So here's another reason on why you might not be hearing some audio if I have say two buses set up here Maybe you have to for whatever reason and I come over here and I'm playing my audio the bus one meter is moving Audio ones moving. I don't hear nothing. What's going on. I'm getting pretty frustrated at this point Here's what you got to do if you have more than one bus going on you want to come up by your window I'm in fair light here case. I didn't say that I'm in fair light But you come up by your viewer here and right here you see bus one to auto Well, this is telling me I want to hear the audio from bus two. I'm sorry. It says bus two dash autumn Yeah, it helps me if I could read right so bus two autumn now This is what is actually coming to my headphones that I can hear and I can't hear anything because I'm only listening to whatever's coming Out of bus two and right now ain't nothing coming out of bus two So if you click this little drop down here You can change that back to bus one now if I play through my clip and I unmute it here by default Now I'm gonna hear coming through my headphones here No problem, but if this was on bus two and now that we're unmuted and I play through it. I Don't hear anything you guys hear anything because I don't hear anything. What's going on sounds like crickets So you can check that and make sure that this setting right here is set to what you want it to be for your audio out So it gets into your headphones So the next thing you want to think about if you're having problems things aren't sounded good You've checked these things and things still aren't working out right you get frustrated You want to bop somebody knows you know what I mean is you want to check your sample rates? So the sample rate of your microphone needs to match the sample rate that resolve is set for now by default resolve is set for 48,000 a sample rate. So where do we check that? Well, come on down to your project settings Go ahead and open that up and under fairlight here. We have audio sample rate right here now You notice it's grayed out. I can't change it So the thing with the sample rate is it needs to be set before you create a timeline? So when you first create your project before you bring in and anything into this project You got to set that sample rate first. So for example, let me just cancel this if I jump back into my edit tab Let's say I delete my timeline here. I'm just gonna hit delete bring my project settings back up And now you see I can change that sample rate right from 44 48 96 or 192 So by default it's 48 and if you just start bringing in media, it's gonna default to 48 So make sure that your microphone is set up to be the same same Sample rate so 48,000 because if they don't match if you're your microphone on your system The sample rate doesn't match then you're gonna run into problems. It's not gonna sound right. It won't play back Right so you want to check that out, but you got to set it in resolve before you Start a new timeline so you create your project obviously I got some media in here So it's working out okay, but you got to set that before you start your timeline or create your timeline here in resolve Now I'm on a Mac here. I know a lot most of you guys I think are on PC So you're gonna have to check out where you set the sample rate on the PC But on the Mac here, you know, I would come to for example, you know my evo4 Which is my audio interface and right here format you can I've got different options on you know How I'm gonna set it, you know if I come to rate here right now I'm on 48 kilohertz 4 channel 24 bit and I want to make sure that that's output So you want to make sure the output matches as well. So I'll come back to the input there you go 48k So it matches resolve so when I go to record we should be good to go and you shouldn't have any problems But if you're getting issues that's something you definitely want to check check the sample rate of your microphone And make sure it matches the sample rate that you have set in DaVinci resolve All right guys, so that was my huge headache for the last few days few weeks two weeks Dude, this was driving me insane But I hope that this is gonna help one of you guys out there when you're trying to set up your voiceovers You can't figure it out things aren't working. You're going crazy like this ain't rocket science I mean don't get me wrong resolve is difficult, but this ain't rocket science, right? So I'm glad I was able to figure this out Hopefully it's gonna help out some of you guys out there trying to record your voiceovers with these various issues that We might run into from time to time so if this video was a little bit helpful It's a little bit guys give this video thumbs up for me subscribe to the channel if you haven't already stay tuned because I've got lots of Microphones I'm checking out we're trying out and you guys might even be winning some so stay tuned and with that said guys Wrapping this one up. I look forward to seeing you guys in the next video. Be well. We'll see you You
