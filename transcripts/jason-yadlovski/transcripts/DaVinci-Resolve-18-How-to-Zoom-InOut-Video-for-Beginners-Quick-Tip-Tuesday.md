If you're brand new to DaVinci Resolve, you might be wondering how you can create a custom zoom in on your clips, kind of like this. That's what we're talking about today. I'm going to show you how to do it. It's quick and easy. Let's jump into Resolve and check it out. Jumping into Resolve here, I am in the Edit tab, which is these icons down at the bottom here. And I've got a clip in my timeline and I have my Inspector open. So Inspector is right up here at the top right. You can't find any of these things. Let's go on up to Workspace and go to Reset, UI Layout, and these things should appear for you. Now let's say we want to zoom in on this clip of this guy walking the tightrope. So what I want to do is put my play head where I want to start the zoom in. I'm going to come up to my Inspector, which is right up here in the top right. Click on the keyframe. Now I'm only going to be using Zoom and Position, but you can use any one of these that you want, or you can select the top one, which will keyframe all of the elements here in Transform. So now that I've clicked my two keyframes here, we have set a keyframe on our clip. Now in our clip, we notice we have these two little icons down here, and if we click on the diamond, that's going to show us our keyframes that we created. And right now under Transform, we've got one keyframe. Now I'm going to go ahead and move ahead a little bit, save out there, and I'm going to come back up to my Inspector, and I'm going to zoom in by either hovering over the Zoom, click, hold, and drag, and I can zoom it like that, or you can plug in a number if you'd like. Let's say I want to go to 1.5 times Zoom, and let's say I want to reposition a little bit, so I'm going to reposition my Y there, or my X a little bit, and now automatically keyframes have been created for me. So if I play through my timeline, we can see we start how the video was, and it zooms in for us, and it's going to stay zoomed in until we keyframe it, and then tell it to zoom back out to the original size. So there's a few ways that we can do that. You can move your playhead forward to wherever you want to start that zoom out. We can actually copy keyframes. So if you click on it and select it, it's going to be red. We can Command or Control C, and then unselect the clip by clicking off of it. Place your playhead where you want, and then use Control or Command V, and boom, it's going to paste in that keyframe for us. I'm going to move my playhead a little bit farther, and let's say I want it to go back to its normal original size right here. I'm going to select the first keyframe, copy it, Control C or Command C. I'm going to deselect it, come up here on my clip, Control V or Command V, and boom, we're zoomed back out. Now when we play it all together, here's how it looks. And there you go, you just created some easy custom zooming here in DaVinci Resolve. Couple bonus tips for you, if you want to see all of the keyframes that we created, which were the X and the Y axis, as well as the X and the Y zoom, come on to your clip, and we have this little dropdown right here. And if you click on that, now it shows us all of the different keyframes that we created. And you can come in here and select one, adjust it, move it by clicking on it and dragging it if you want. You've got options on different things you can do with the keyframes right here. Another bonus tip for you, if you wanted to ease in and ease out of those keyframes, all you have to do is hover over one of your keyframes, you can right click on it, and you have the option to set it to linear, ease in, ease out, or ease in and out. And that'll help make your transition a little bit smoother there on the zoom that we made. So it's as easy as that creating an easy, simple zoom in DaVinci Resolve. Now that you know how to create a cool custom zoom in on your clip, you might want to learn a little bit more about Resolve. And I've got a bunch of videos over here that you can check out. And hopefully, help get you learned on Resolve a little bit quicker. All right, guys, I will see you in the next video. Peace.
