Adventure Resolve 18 transitions for beginners. Now, you might not be a beginner, but you don't wanna go anywhere because you're probably still gonna learn something in this video. But hey, if you're new to my channel, my name is Jay Yilofsky. Talk a lot about Adventure Resolve. A lot of audio stuff, love audio, I'm an audio guy, but I do love all parts of Resolve and I try to help you beginners get going and really just kinda simplify it because Resolve's a complicated program. So today we're gonna be talking about transitions, everything from the basics on how to drop it onto your clip, two more advanced things like saving transitions, modifying them, how to set defaults for duration and all kinds of fun stuff. I'm gonna timestamp everything down below so you can check it out, jump to the points that you're interested in. That way we can kinda speed things up for you. Today's video is sponsored by Motion Array and we're gonna talk about them later, but we're gonna be using some clips from Motion Array to apply transitions to, and I'm gonna use them as examples to show you how all this cool transition stuff works. Now, real quick, if you're on a version other than Adventure Resolve 18, a lot of this stuff is gonna be the same, whether it's a future version or whether it's a previous version, a lot of it's gonna be the same. So you can still check out this video if you're not on version 18 yet. And all these things are gonna work in the free version as well as the studio version. All right, let's jump into Resolve and get learned about some transitions. All right, we are in Adventure Resolve 18 here. I'm running on the studio version. If you've got the free version, it's gonna look the same and everything is gonna work exactly the same. So let's make sure that we see the same things on the screen just so it's not confusing and help make it a little bit easier for you guys. So first thing you wanna do, I'm in the edit tab, which is this guy right down here. Click on that and it's gonna get you into the edit tab. Now, a little bonus tip, I do all my editing in the edit tab. I don't think the cut tab is worth it, at least not for my style of editing. We'll talk about that in another video. But if you just get started, edit tab right here. Next come up to workspace and we wanna go to reset UI layout and this is gonna ensure you guys see the same thing that I'm seeing. So once you reset the UI layout, this is what you're gonna see. At least it should be what you're gonna see. Now I'm gonna close my media pool because I don't need it. I've already got my clips in my timeline and hopefully you do as well. So I'm gonna click right up here and close the media pool. So let's start off with the basics. How do I add a transition between two clips? First we need to find the transitions. In order to find them, you wanna come to your effects right up here. So once you click on effects, this is what you're gonna be looking at. And if you come on the left here and you click on video transitions, that's gonna give you all of your video transitions. To put them on a clip, it's as easy as holding, dragging it down and dropping it onto a clip. And then once you do that, it's gonna be there. So let's play through. Let's see what that looks like. ["Dissolve Transitions"] Nice little cross fade into your clips. So if that's all you wanted to know, you're good to go. Let's talk about what kind of video transitions we have here. So just looking in the window, we've got different kinds of dissolve transitions here. We have different shape transitions or iris transitions. We've got different motion transitions like barn doors or pushing from side to side. We have different shapes that you can use. Maybe you wanna use a little heart or something. I don't know. You got shapes there. You've got different kinds of wipes that you can use. We've got a user section where you can create your own and we'll get into that in a little bit. And then you've got really cool fusion transitions here that do different kinds of things. And one of the best things about the transitions is if you put your play head where you wanna put a transition and you hover over any one of these, you can scroll back and forth and see what that's gonna look like. What will that transition look like? So you don't have to drag it and drop it on, give it a try, don't like it, remove it. No, I'm not. You just hover over it and slide back and forth. You don't have to click any buttons. Just slide your mouse back and forth and it's gonna give you a preview of what the transition's gonna look like. So that is super handy. Now you may have a nice big powerful machine, but if you don't, here's a few tips on how you can make the playback a little bit smoother for your transitions. So you wanna come on up to the playback menu up here. You wanna come down to render cache and you wanna make sure that smart is selected here. And that is gonna tell resolve, hey, when there's a little bit of downtime, take those transitions and render them up for me so that they're good to go when I play back my video. So that should take care of it and do the trick for you, but if your computer needs a little bit more help, you can also come to timeline proxy resolution and change this from full to either half or quarter. Now it's gonna make the image in your viewer look not as sharp or it might look a little blurry because it's doing a lower quality, but that's just the playback. It's not gonna affect your render. So those are two options there that can help make your transitions playback smoother for you. So let's say you're having some trouble. You can't drop your transition between two clips. For example, if I grab my cross dissolve and I try and put it on these two clips right here, but it won't let me put it there. If I brought it down to a different set of clips, no problem, that works. Why can't I put a transition in between these two clips? Well, the reason for that is because you need to have a little bit of overlap between your two clips. And just to show you what I'm talking about, right now, if I just move this clip over a little bit, I'm right at the very beginning of this clip and on this clip, on the left, I'm at the very end of the clip. So when I put them together, there's no overlap between those two clips. So how do we get a little bit of overlap so I can drop a transition on there? So there's a few different ways we can create that little bit of overlap that we need in order to apply our transition. A nice quick and easy way is to come to this tool right here. You're gonna hover over your clip, click and drag. And you can see the white box that's showing up there. That's showing me how much of my clip I have on either side of where my cuts are currently on that clip in my timeline. So you can see if I drag it to the left here, it creates an overlap with the previous clip. So I can bring it to where I want and let go. And then we should be good to go for that clip. Now for the clip on the left, I wanna do the same thing. So if I click hold and drag, you notice now I can only pull it out with that little white box that you see there. It only comes out a little bit. And that's because I'm already using almost that entire clip, there's just a little bit that I trimmed off the beginning there that I can use as an overlap. So I'm gonna go ahead and push that forward a little bit and just leave it like that. So now we should have enough overlap between our clips to apply our transition. Grab our cross fade, bring it down, boom, it'll drag and drop right on there for us. And now you can see if I play through it, it works out just fine for us. Now here's another method that you can use to adjust your clips so you get a little bit of overlap. I'm just gonna select my clips and copy them up to a new track. Let's say that my two clips here are all the way extended. I've used as much as I could of the particular clip, I'm all the way extended, I got no more clip left to work with. Well, instead of using the tool we just took a look at, you can just come and grab your edge and slide it in a little bit. And if you zoom in, you can even slide in a little bit less. It just depends on how far you're zoomed in, but I can bring it in a few frames, maybe six frames there. And on this one over here, let's do six frames as well. So I'm gonna just click, hold and drag it back. It looks pretty good. Now if I bring these two clips together, take my crosses off, drag and drop it on there. Now we can drop our transition onto our clips. Here's another problem you might run into. What if you drag your transition, try to drop it on your clip and it won't go in the middle. It'll only go on one side of the clip. Why is that happening? So if I drop this on here and we take a look at our clips, on this first clip, it's extended all the way out. I'm using the entire clip so there's no overlap with the next clip. Now with my clip on the left here, I do have some overlap, which is why we can put the transition on one side. So for example, if I just move this clip over, you can see, look, I've got a little extra, few frames there where I can extend that clip and that's why I'm able to apply a transition, but only to one side of the two clips. So if you're having problems with your clips and putting transitions on there, make sure you've got a little bit of the clip on either side of where your cut happens. Because if you don't have any overlap, you're not gonna be able to drop a transition on there. A lot of people get frustrated by this because it's different than a lot of other programs where you can just push the clips together and they'll automatically create a transition or whatever. But this is how you do it in Resolve. Might be a little bit different than what you're used to, but make sure you got a little bit on either side of your cuts and you're good to go. All right, I'm gonna delete these two tracks. Let's say that you want to make your transition longer or shorter. How do we do that? The easiest and fastest way to make your transitions longer and shorter are to come down in your timeline here. And if you hover over your transition, you're gonna see your cursor turn into this little icon and you can drag it out, make it longer if you want, or you can shrink it down and make it shorter if you'd like. You can go all the way down just a few frames and if you can't get it exactly where you want, try zooming in on your timeline a little bit more and that's gonna give you a finer adjustment here of being able to adjust that transition. Now another way that you can adjust your transitions is to use the inspector. So you wanna select your transition, come on up to your inspector and right up here you have duration. You can come in here, get this little icon, click and hold and drag back and forth. You can punch in a number if you double click in there, say 3.0 seconds. You can do it by number of frames if you want, if you know that's how you wanna do it. So if you've got some options on how you can adjust the length of your transitions. Now zooming out on my timeline here, let's say we wanna adjust some of the options or we wanna customize our transition a little bit. So say you started with the default transition across dissolve like we have here and it wanted to modify it a little bit. So in the inspector, that's where we can do that. You can see right here, we've got our alignment so we can move it to either side of the cut. We can have it across the middle of the cut or on the other side of the cut, depends on what you wanna do. Now if you wanna change the style and the look of a default transition to kinda make it your own a little bit, we've got style right here and there's different things that you can try here to make it look different and just kinda customize it. You just play through and see which one you like and then you can just go ahead and use that one. Let's try shadows here. Pretty cool, right? Being able to change the style here, I think is relatively new or maybe I just never tried it before. Below the style there, you've got your start ratio and end ratio, you can adjust those as far as when it comes in and when it goes out if you want. The next one is pretty good too, we have ease. So if you click on here, right now it's got no easing and actually if we look in the timeline at the transition, you can see this line right here. It's just a consistent line, as the transition comes in, it's consistent. It doesn't ease in or ease out. But let's say you wanted to ease it, easy, come on up here. You can change it to just ease in and if we look at our transition here, you can see it kinda slowly comes in now. You can ease it out, you can ease in and out and you can see now we have a little S curve here on our transition in the timeline or you can make it a custom curve if you want. Now if you were gonna do the custom curve, I'm gonna hit custom here, there's a little diamond here on the transition itself in the timeline and if you don't see this, you might need to just check your view by coming to your timeline view options right here and make sure you have either this one or this one selected. If you got the first option here selected, the simple view, you're not gonna see it, but if you've got one of these two selected, then you will see this little diamond in the option here. So if you go ahead and select your transition, click on the diamond, it's gonna open up this little window right here or this little bar I should say. Then you wanna click on this right here, which is gonna open up your keyframes. Now you can adjust the curve to be however you want. I can grab it and play with it, I can move it around. If I click on a point, say right there, it's gonna give me a handle, I can change the type of curve if I want. Grab both of these guys, pull them around. I can change the point if I'm gonna add any points in there. These are keyframes, so if I add a keyframe or something you can change the point. So let's say if I put my playhead here, I add one. You could do whatever you want, change the type, make it smooth, but you get the idea, you can customize it in a lot of different ways and really make these standard transitions your own. So let's say I just went through, I modified up the transition here, now I wanna save it as my own preset essentially, so that way I can apply it later and I don't have to go and change all these settings. How do I do that? Well, this is super easy, all you have to do, again, come to the timeline, click on your transition, you're gonna right click and you're gonna say, create transition preset. Once you do that, it's gonna open up this window and you can name it whatever you want. So I'm gonna say, cross dissolve, let's say custom. Gonna go ahead and hit okay. Now once I do that, where do I find it? If I wanna use it again, how do I use it? So you wanna come again, back to your effects right here, open that up, video transitions and scroll down to the user section right here. You can double click and open it up if it's not open. You have cross dissolve custom and this is what we just created. Now I have two other ones here, a slide down for 12 frames and a slide up for 12 frames. I use this all the time in my videos, it kinda looks like this, if I slide it down, that's what it does and then if I want to bring it back up, slide it up, that's how it works. You wanna slide it back down, there we go. So those are two custom presets that I created that I use all the time in my YouTube videos. Now just to grab one of these other shape transitions, just to play with a little bit and show you some options here. Let's say I did, I'm gonna grab the arrow iris, let's drop that on our clips. So you can see what the options are, if I click on the transition right here in my timeline, come on up to my inspector, make sure that that's open, but moving back to the transition, if I just go in the middle here, we can change the aspect ratio. So the shape of that particular transition, we can adjust it a little bit and if you ever change any of these and you need to get it back to how it was, just double click it and it's gonna reset it for you. You can change the center of it and one of the cool things with some of the shapes and things is that you can add in a border. So if I just bring this up, you can add in a border, let's back it up a little so we can see it a little more, you can add the border in, you can change the thickness of it, you can change the color of it. So let's say I wanna do a red one, there you go, you can add that in. You can also, instead of doing the border, you could just feather the edges, right? So we've got the border that we can slide and it changes the feathering amount of our particular shape that we're working with here. So if I change it to like that and then I play through it, it just kind of fades in, which is kind of cool. It doesn't have that hard edge, it just kind of blends everything together a little bit more. And again, you can ease it in and out if you want and make any kind of changes to customize it. Now here's a cool tip for you. Let's say you made a bunch of custom settings, you adjusted the time, let's say I'm gonna just drop that down a little bit, you moved it off center a little, you did some other things, you feathered it. Man, maybe I don't wanna use the arrow iris, maybe I wanna try the oval iris instead. Well, you could just click on this and drag and drop it onto your clips, but it's gonna reset all those custom settings that you just came up with. So in order to keep those custom settings, if you come to transition type right here at the top of the inspector, click the dropdown, now we can choose any one of the transitions that are in our effects library, but it's gonna keep all of our custom settings that we just created. So let's say I wanted to do the oval iris, I'm gonna click on that, and now it kept all of our settings. So if I play through with our oval iris, boom, there you go. It keeps my settings, you don't have to recreate it each time. And if you like it that much, just go ahead and save it as a preset, it's gonna be in your effects library and you can use it any time that you want. So let's say you've got a transition that you like and you just wanna copy it from one clip to the next clip. How do we do that? Pretty easy, you can just come in and select your clip and if you're having trouble selecting it, zoom in a little bit more in your timeline and that's gonna help you select it. Then you wanna hold your alt on a PC or option on a Mac, get your little pointer there, click, drag, drop, and that's how you're gonna copy your transitions. Now maybe you've got a bunch of transitions, they're all the same kind like we just copied here, but you wanna make a change and you don't wanna go through and do every single one at a time, cause that's a pain and you don't wanna have to drag new transitions on or copy them again, cause that's a pain too. How can we edit multiple transitions at once? Again, pretty easy, select your transitions. So select your first one and you can use either command or control to select multiple transitions. And again, if you're having a hard time selecting them, zoom in a little bit on your timeline, that's gonna help. And then once I've selected them, I can come on up to the inspector, open that up and we can make any adjustment that we want and it's gonna apply to all of our transitions. Now you do need to have the transitions be the same transition, otherwise I think it's gonna mess them up, but you can come in and change them to be whatever you want to say, I want to change my border a little bit, wanna make it a little bit bigger. Okay, so that's good. Now can we double check it? So let's say our border is 289. So if I click each one individually, 289, 289 and 289. So that worked out pretty good. So that's how you can edit multiple transitions at once using the inspector. Now let's talk about how do we set a default transition for DaVinci Resolve. By default, when you open Resolve, you start using it, the cross dissolve is gonna be your default transition. But let's say, yeah, I don't want the cross dissolve, I want something a little more fun and exciting. Super easy, check it out, go into your effects library, again to your transitions, video transitions, and you wanna just scroll and let's say, here's one that I use a lot, the foreground wipe. And let's say, I wanna make it my default. You can right click on that transition and come to set as standard transition. And you can see once I do that right here in the corner, it now has that little red tick mark there. That's gonna tell me which transition is set up as my default transition. Now that's gonna come in handy for the keyboard shortcut, I'm gonna show you in a minute here. But before we get to that, let's take a look at another little feature here and it is this little star right here. That's gonna allow you to add the transition to your favorites. Let's say you've got maybe two, three, four different transitions you use all the time. If you click on that little star, it's gonna add it right down here into your favorites. So you don't have to scroll up and down all the time, looking for the one that you want. You can just come down to your favorites, drag it over and drop it onto your clips. So having favorites comes in handy and it's a nice little feature to have. So now that you've set your default transition, let's say maybe you want to change the default duration of your transition. Think by default, it's one second. So depending on your frame rate, it works out to be about one second. But let's say that you wanted to change that. How do we change that? It's pretty easy here. You wanna come into DaVinci Resolve, the menu up at the top left here. Come on down to preferences. That's gonna open up this window for you. You wanna be under user right here at the top. Come on down to editing. And you wanna scroll down a little bit to general settings right here. Under the general settings here, we have standard transition duration. And you can set this to be whatever you want in seconds. Or if you wanna do it in frames, you can do it that way too. I know for me, a lot of times I make it shorter than one second because I just think it looks better for some of the transitions that I frequently use. But the default here is one second and you can change that to be whatever you want. Just as a little bonus here, you can see you can change your still duration if you're putting in pictures in the resolve. You can change the standard duration for that too. There's a lot of other cool stuff here, but that's for another video. Once you set a duration that you want, go ahead and hit save. You're good to go. Any new transition you drop on your timeline is gonna be in that duration that you set there. Next, we're gonna talk about some handy keyboard shortcuts here that are gonna allow you to add transitions to your clips a whole lot quicker. But before we do, I wanna take a minute to talk about motion array. So these clips that I have in my project file here are from motion array, as well as the music track here from motion array. They have so much great stuff, assets that you can use in your videos that really bring your videos to that next level. They've got all kinds of awesome templates and intros and outros and graphics overlays. I mean, the amount of stuff they have there is awesome. I'm always looking on there to try and find things that I can use in my video. And really, it just helps bring everything to that next level. So if you're looking for some awesome assets for your videos, you definitely wanna check out motion array, see what they have to offer, and see if it's something that you might be interested in. And I do have a link in the description below that's gonna save you 50 bucks on a yearly subscription. So big thank you to motion array for sponsoring today's video. So getting into the keyboard shortcuts here, let's say we wanna add transitions to only our video clips, and we just want a keyboard shortcut to do it. Now keep in mind, whatever transition you have set as your default transition here, remember with the little red tick there on the transition, that's what's gonna be applied by using these keyboard shortcuts. So the first one here we have is alt plus the letter T, or option plus the letter T if you're on a Mac. So if I select my two clips, and I use option for me, alt probably for a lot of you guys, press letter T, it's gonna drop that transition right onto my clips. Now you notice it's gonna do the beginning, the middle, the end, it's gonna do all of the cuts of those clips that you selected. You can select as many clips as you want, it'll only drop it onto the video portion of your clips. Now let's say you try that and you get an error message that looks a little something like this. I select these two clips, option or alt T, and you get a message that looks like this. Now the reason this is coming up is because you don't have enough overlap, between your two clips, like we talked about earlier in the video. So you can have resolve, trim the clips automatically for you right here, click, click, click, trim clips, there you go, a little tongue twister there, and it's gonna automatically trim them enough to put in that transition. Or let's say there's a certain clip, like this one in the middle where there's no overlap, but I don't have any room to overlap those clips, I don't wanna trim them. You can hit skip clips, and then it's only gonna put the transition where it can. It's not gonna trim any of the clips, it'll just put it where it can. So in this case, if I hit it, you see it doesn't do it in between the clips right here, it only applies it on the end right here. So another cool feature here in resolve with transitions is the ability to add audio transitions. Now let's find them, if we come back to our effects library, make sure that's open, you've got audio transitions. Now there's only three by default, you've got the crossfade, crossfade minus 3 dB, and crossfade plus 3 dB. So maybe you wanna use this when you're transitioning between one song to the next song, but let's see how these work. So if I just make a cut in my audio clip right here, let's say I wanna apply a transition, again, just like the video transitions, drag and drop, put it right on my clip. Now you do need to have a little bit of overlap with your audio clips as well, just like you do with your video clips, so keep that in mind. Now if I undo that, now let's say I got a bunch of clips that I wanna add a crossfade transition to the audio, maybe it's speaking clips for me, and it's all broken up, and I want it to just transition a little smoother, the transitions are a little harsh. We can do that with a keyboard shortcut, so just select all the clips that you wanna apply the transition to. Again, it's gonna be the default transition, which in this case for audio is the crossfade 0 dB, so it's not raising or lowering anything. And if you hold the shift key plus the letter T, boom, it's gonna drop on that transition onto audio only clips. So that's a quick way to do it. If you've got a lot of audio clips, you want a little bit of a transition or fade in there from one clip to the next to help just kinda smooth it out a little bit. Now let's say I wanted to add transitions to the video clips and the audio clips at the same time. And keep in mind the default transition is what is gonna be applied to both your video clips and your audio clips. Easy enough, we can come in here, select all of our clips, and this time you wanna use control on a PC or command on a Mac plus the letter T. So for me, command T, and you notice I get this message because there's some clips that need to get trimmed, so I'm just gonna go ahead and say, okay, trim the clips. And now you can see we've got transitions on all of our video clips, as well as our audio clips. So that wraps up this video on transitions, guys. I hope it was helpful. Comment below if you've got questions, you're not sure about something. Also, if you are a beginner, drop a comment below with things that you wanna learn. Try to make things simple for you because this program's hard enough as it is. And a big thank you to MotionArray for sponsoring today's video.
