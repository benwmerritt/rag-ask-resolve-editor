Music Welcome everybody welcome welcome today we've got something a little bit different here we're gonna be talking about and that is this guy the black magic design pocket cinema 6k g2 camera take a look at this guy this thing is awesome so I have a contact over a black magic design for a lot of DaVinci resolve stuff and I've got the ability to borrow some of their equipment and give it a try I kind of was curious you know how is it to use one of these guys and black magic design was kind enough to send this out to me to try out I've been using it for a few weeks I got lots of different kinds of footage with it and and I just wanted to share my thoughts on it and let you guys know what I think about it I'm not paid to give you my thoughts on this guy they sent me you know just to try out and really just to share my thoughts with you guys I've had it for a few weeks about about a month or so and it's it's an amazing camera I'll tell you that straight up front it's an amazing camera the quality of this thing is awesome there are some challenges I found with it which we'll talk about in a few minutes here but overall I think it's a fantastic camera I mean if you're looking to get some top-notch video boom this guy is where it's at so real quick what did they send me so they sent me the camera itself came in the original box here it's got all the you know original parts and pieces in there the battery it's got a grip a grip camera strap in there a couple other things in there so everything came in the box primarily I've been using the camera like this but this is a great camera they sent me the viewfinder right so we've got this little guy right here which I have on the camera right now right here and it does work good it's pretty good it's nice when you hold it to your eye you can you can be real stable with that camera you know it gives you like a third point of contact the EVF or the electronic viewfinder here did work out really well they also sent out this guy which is the the grip base for it the pro grip now I didn't put this on only because I didn't need the extra battery life and I didn't want to get into it if I hadn't used it I was just shooting a lot of random stuff just to try it out I didn't make a few little sequences here making some tacos and making some cinnamon rolls so I think I'll throw those in here so you guys can see the samples what this camera looks like but they did send this to me I didn't try it only because I wasn't out filming a whole lot and I didn't need the extra batteries in here I just used the battery that came in here you know the single battery that goes in the unit itself so just off You know when I took this thing out of the box and grabbed it it feels kind of like a DSLR only a lot bigger, right? So in the hand, it's it's a lot beefier now I wouldn't say that it's necessarily heavier, but it's definitely bigger, right? And especially once we attach it attach a lens on the front of it it it gets pretty big, right? But it's not heavy and it's still easy to maneuver, right? I can I can hold it with two hands no problem and with the electronic viewfinder up here boom Can hold it on my face and you know I can see everything that's going on in the viewfinder here And it just gives me that you know extra stabilization I need if I'm standing or maybe I'm kneeling and I'm trying to film How did I think the experience was using this camera? Well, just so you guys know where I'm coming from I'm coming from filming with a DSLR. I've got a Canon 5D Mark 4 That's what I'm used to I have a C100 Mark 2 right here that I'm filming on now that the majority of my YouTube videos are Filmed on so that's kind of the the world that I'm coming from and Jumping onto this camera like I said a little bit to learn with the menus as far as filming with it I thought it was great. I mean you just it feels good in the hands You know it is bigger than something like a DSLR, but it's not overly huge I think it feels good to work with the camera. It doesn't feel too big. It's not heavy I mean there's a little bit of weight up in the front here, but the back of it is like surprisingly light Right it almost feels like hey, where's the rest that's in here, right? I think some DSLRs that I've used feel a little bit beefier, right? But I mean the quality built the build quality of it feels great. It was easy to use and And and I enjoyed it, you know, I enjoyed using it I also tried it out as like a webcam, right? Because we can use that HDMI on the side over here and I plugged it in used it as a webcam and I mean it did great Obviously the quality looks fantastic It was crisp. It was sharp and if you've seen any of the other videos on my channel recently You probably saw it and didn't even know it and I've tried plugging it into the wall and letting it run that way when I was using it as a Webcam that worked out fantastic overall. I mean the camera was really nice to use the quality is fantastic I mean, there's there's a lot of great things about this camera and I really enjoyed using it Now one thing that did help the quality of this be really good is that I do have all Canon L glass and that's what I was putting on here Canon L glass So obviously when it comes to cameras a lot of times the glass makes a huge difference on your camera whether it's video or Photography the glass is going to make a bigger difference sometimes than even the camera body itself Obviously you got to be able to record some good video and high quality video on your cameras But that L glass and that good glass is going to make a huge difference So that helped also with with the quality that I get out of the recordings on this thing Now I did try out a whole bunch of the different formats This can do the black magic raw the be raw files. I recorded a bunch in there some at 6k summit 4k I tried the Pro res settings a little bit and Tried that in 4k and 6k. I mean they all seem to be pretty good I'm gonna be editing together a few little clips with those I'm gonna throw in samples here when I'm done not yapping it up here So you guys can just kind of see what the footage looked like but overall either kind of footage whether using the Pro res settings Or whether you're using the be raw settings didn't matter I mean if they all seem to come out pretty good quality and for what I do I don't know that would make a difference on which one I use other than the file sizes, right? The file sizes are gonna be you know different between the two formats now Let's just talk about some of the things that that maybe I struggled with or that We're hard for me to adjust to right now I'm not saying these are bad things for the camera just in my experience coming from the background that I have You know in the types of videos I make the filming that I do and in my workflow Some of the the things that were challenging for me with this camera So one of them was the fact that it's hard for me to film myself with this camera Now why is it hard for me to film myself? Well for me the number one reason was that it doesn't have continuous auto focus I am super used to having continuous auto focus so that if I'm backing up I'm moving around I'm vlogging whatever it might be that camera is gonna focus on me And I'm confident that it's gonna get me in focus and do a good job and On the black magic pocket cinema here. It's primarily manual focus, right? It'll do a quick focus for you, you know and just focus on something, but it's not continuous And that was super challenging now if it was just me filming stuff, right? I think I could get used to you know focusing manually and all that and I don't think that'd be a problem It would just take me some time to get used to it But the fact that I film myself alone or film myself by myself allow myself to introduce myself Anyway that I feel myself by myself pretty much all the time It's it would be super hard for me to have this as a primary camera and be able to get you know Good focus all the time because I like to go with a shallower and depth of field and stuff when I can I'm 2.8 or whatever it might be and with the camera like this if I move a little bit boom I'm out of focus and then it doesn't look good, right? So the other cameras that I use on a daily basis have good auto focus That is a big deal for me and my workflow right now Like I said if I didn't film myself all the time and I just film things right people whatever I was the the guy behind the camera All right, no problem. No big deal But as a solo creator here the auto focus is huge for me and and and was one of the things that was really hard with this Camera sure you can pre-focus on things But like I said with a shallower or depth of field and you know not too far from the camera It's real quick and really easy to get out of focus So that was one thing that was tough The other thing that was tough is if I'm trying to film myself the screen here doesn't flip out right and I couldn't find a Way that I could connect to like you know an app or something where I could monitor myself right and make changes or see What I'm looking like sure I can put an extra monitor on top and and see you know what the camera is seeing But I'd still have to get up to make adjustments or make changes At least as far as I could tell you know with some quick Google searches, right? So that was that was the challenging part is that if I wanted to use this by myself and film myself I think I would run into issues it would take me more time and be a little more frustrating than I would want it to be But that aside this camera is gonna be awesome overall The quality is great. It's awesome. I rather know I keep saying that but it really is a cool camera It was a lot of fun to use so that's kind of like my overall You know feelings on the camera what I thought about it a little bit about it I think now really the best thing to do is just kind of show you some footage I recorded all the footage that I did in the raw format whether it was be raw pro res You know the raw footage so that way I could you know try color grading it and in resolve and see how it works So I'll show you a few little sequences here I put together with you know footage that I caught from this camera And I think what I'd like to do is actually provide a file or two for you guys to download for free Just so you could check it out see what the be raw files are look like and maybe you could give it a little edit in Resolve try it out. You know because we can't all afford these guys You know so maybe you want to try it out I'm gonna make a file or two available for you guys to to give a try give it a try and kind of see how it works out See what it's like to take for a test drive in DaVinci resolve so enough blabbing for me here You guys are probably hearing me talk, but let's go ahead and roll some footage here Some things that I shot with this camera nothing fancy but at least gives you an idea of you know a few little things that I filmed with it and And my experience with testing it out here. So roll that footage. We'll wrap her up at the end here You You You You You You You You So that is gonna do it here guys the black magic pocket cinema 6k g2 that's a mouthful there It was an awesome camera to try out black magic design.
