Have you ever had some dialogue that you just want to make a little bit crisper and a little bit clearer so that it's easier to understand for your audience? That's exactly what I'm going to show you how to do today. We're going to take a sample of audio and make the voice sound a little bit clearer. If you're new to my channel, my name is Jason Yadlowski. I talk a lot about audio and fairlight in DaVinci Resolve here, but I've got tons of DaVinci Resolve videos that can help you along your journey in learning this awesome program. With that said, let's jump into Resolve. I'm going to show you how to increase the clarity of your dialogue. I'm in DaVinci Resolve here and I've got a sample clip in my timeline and I want you to listen to it as I play through it and see if you think it needs to be a little bit clearer so that whoever's watching our video just understands what I'm saying a little bit better. I'm using a lav mic and a lot of times the clarity on lav mics are not that great. So I'm going to show you how we can quickly and easily fix that. So let's play through the clip first and then I'm going to show you how to fix it. Another great technique to know is how to increase the clarity of the voice a little bit using the EQ. It's a few simple changes and tweaks that we can do to just increase the clarity and make the voice sound a little bit clearer. And that's what I'm going to show you how to do in this little clip. Okay, so it's not too bad, right? Not too bad, but it could be better. Now we can make these changes right here in the edit tab and we're going to be using the EQ. Don't worry, it's really easy EQ work to make these changes, but I want to apply it on the entire track level because if I recorded with this setup, a lav mic, I probably need to do this for all my clips, not just an individual clip. So we're going to jump into Fairlight and use the EQ in Fairlight and make those changes that we want. So I'm going to hit the musical notes at the bottom here to jump into Fairlight. You want to make sure that your mixer is open. So at the top here we have mixer and in our mixer we have our EQ right here on my vocal track. So I'm going to double click that to open up my EQ. When it comes to the EQ, I could give you frequency numbers and all that, but that gets complicated. I'm going to keep it real simple and we're just going to use our ears to make adjustments and get it to sound the way that we want it to sound. So when it comes to clarity for dialogue, we want to increase the higher end frequencies. So if we look at the EQ here from approximately 3,000 to 4,000 up to 8,000, it's kind of where we want to increase. But you could just take your default settings right here, play through your clip, grab this point 5 and just boost this up and we can see it's increasing our higher end frequencies. So that's what we're going to do first because it's the easiest thing that you could do and you really don't need to know anything other than grab this point and move it back like this. So we're going to play through our clip. I'm going to grab point 5, bring it up and I'm going to drag it back until my audio, my dialogue sounds a little bit clearer. So let's go ahead and do that. I'm going to start with it at zero, play it back and we're going to make the adjustment until it sounds good, right? We have to develop our ears so that we can hear the sound that we want for our dialogue. Another great technique to know is how to increase the clarity of the voice a little bit using the EQ. It's a few simple changes and tweaks that we can do. Okay, could you hear the difference there? Now you might need a good pair of headphones or a good pair of speakers to really hear the difference but let me play a little before and after for you. Another great technique to know is how to increase the clarity of the voice a little bit using the EQ. So can you hear how it got a little bit clearer there? It's just going to make it easier for our audience to listen to and to understand what we're saying in our dialogue. Now we could just leave our EQ like this but if you want to get a little bit more precise and just fine tune it a little bit more, here's another thing that you can try. So when it comes to our EQ, a lot of times we don't need to boost these things way up on the high end here, right? They're just frequencies that we don't need in our dialogue. But what we can do is change the way our band 5 is working, right? So if we look in our band 5 down here, I can click on this guy and change it to a bell-shaped curve. And now you can see we have a different shape for our .5. Now if I hover over my .5 and if you have a middle mouse wheel, you can scroll your mouse wheel and it's going to make that either more sharp, which means it's affecting less frequencies, or we can bend it out and more frequencies will be affected. So in this case, I kind of want to bend it out quite a bit to affect a few frequency ranges. So where I want to look with this point now is somewhere around that 4 to 8k range, somewhere in there, I want to play through my clip and I'm going to boost it up and just move it back and forth until it sounds the way I want it to sound, until it's a little bit clearer and a little bit easier to understand. So let's go ahead and do that. Another great technique to know is how to increase the clarity of the voice a little bit using the EQ. It's a few simple changes and tweaks that we can do to just increase the clarity and make the voice. So there we go. I think that sounds pretty good a little before and after for you. Here you go. Here's before and then I'll turn it on for an after. Another great technique to know is how to increase the clarity of the voice a little bit. So can you hear it there? It gets a little bit clearer, it's a little bit crisper and a little bit easier to understand. Now if you want to go just a little extra step further, you could come in here, just turn on your band 6 and just bring it back just a little bit like that. Now what that's going to do is just cut out any of those really high end frequencies that we don't want to hear, right? Just like I just mentioned, we don't need that really high end frequency stuff in our dialogue, it's just not necessary. So we could just throw on what's called a low pass filter. So everything above it gets cut out, everything below it gets to pass through and this is just going to help get rid of any of those really high end frequencies that we don't need for our dialogue. And as a bonus bonus tip here, if you find that your audio still sound in a little muddy or a little bit boomy, I do have a video on how to do that, but I'm going to show you real quick what you can do is come into your EQ, just turn on your band 1 and all you have to do is grab your band 1 point and bring it up until it doesn't sound so muddy or boomy and that's going to help get rid of that low end frequencies that you just don't need and it's going to further contribute to increasing the clarity of your dialogue. So let's just play through that real quick and we're going to add that in, then your audio is going to be sounding really sweet. A great technique to know is how to increase the clarity of the voice a little bit using the EQ. It's a few simple changes and tweaks that we can do to just... Alright, there we go. Now you're just doing it by ear here, right? We're listening to make sure that it sounds like we're cleaning it up. So just again, one final before and after here. Here's what it sounds like before, then I'll turn it on with these few simple changes and it's going to make a big difference. Another great technique to know is how to increase the clarity of the voice a little bit using the EQ. Really big difference there. I think it helps a lot to use a little bit of EQ on almost every single dialogue clip and you can even take a microphone that is super cheap and doesn't sound great, use a little EQ on it and really make that microphone sound good in your videos. Increasing the clarity of your dialogue here in DaVinci Resolve, it's real easy, a few simple changes.

Now hopefully it recorded all that because I did this once already and for whatever reason the screen recorder didn't record audio from Resolve. I hate when that happens, right? But hey, it happens sometimes. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? But we are back to filming. Time to film up the next video. See ya.
