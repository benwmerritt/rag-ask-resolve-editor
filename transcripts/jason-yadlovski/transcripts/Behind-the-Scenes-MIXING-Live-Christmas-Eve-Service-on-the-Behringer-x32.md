In Christ alone, who took on flesh, The fullness of God in helpless pain, This gift of love and righteousness, The storm by the ones He came to save, Till on that cross that Jesus died, The wrath of God was satisfied, For every sin on Him was paid, Hear in the depth of Christ, I live. There in the ground, His body lay, Light of the world by darkness, They scour Him, they burst Him, Oh, He for His name, Oh, from the great He rose again, And as He stands in victory, Since person's loss, His friend brought me, Oh, I am Him, and He is mine, One with the precious blood of Christ. No guilt in life, no fear in death, This is the power of Christ in me, From life's first try to final breath, Jesus commands my destiny, No power of heaven, no scheme of end, He never plowed me from His hands, Till He returns, or calls me home, Hear in the power of Christ, I stand. Amen. Long Hill Chapel belongs to a denomination called the Christian Missionary Alliance. And as such, we send missionaries all over the globe, Whether it's in this community, or it's across the country, or it's across the world, To tell people of all nations, all tongues, and all tribes, about the good news of Jesus Christ. And we have a couple missionaries that we support here at our church, And they have sent us videos of what Christmas looks like in their context, In where they are in the world. And so let's check this out. I don't care if the house is packed with the streets of lights and broken, I don't care if we are surrounded with nothing here to help with, Love is not a toy, but no pain that we'll conceive, Love is a simple joy that our own. I don't care if the car gets stained, we've got food on my table, I don't care if it's gone great, now that our wrong man's wanted stable, Love is who we are, and no season can contain it, and love we never felt before, we seem who, who, who, who, hello, hello. Then love me as love, is Christ my rernered I she stab it. Don't mess it up. When perfection keeps you wanted All we need is your best, my love That's all that he wanted Love is how we do Let no judgment move a movement Love, I love to you And I sing Ooh-oo-oo-ooh-oo-oo-ooo Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo Ahh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Let love lead us, love is Christmas. Let love lead us, love is Christmas. === Music === In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. This was the first census that took place while Pinerius was governor of Syria, and everyone went to his own town to register. So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea to Bethlehem, the town of David, because he belonged to the house in line of David. He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him, and was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for him in the inn. And there were shepherds living out in their fields nearby, keeping watch over their flock at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, Do not be afraid, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Today in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you. He is Christ the Lord. This will be a sign to you. You will find a baby wrapped in cloth, lying in a manger. Suddenly a great company of heavenly hosts appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests. When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, Let go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about. So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about the child and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told. Thank you. We've heard a lot of different stories, we've sung songs, we've heard about how Christmas is celebrated around the world. And for all of us, we come at this from a little bit of a different place. Some of us, we cannot wait until what's good happen later in tomorrow morning. I know that's true for my kids. Some of you have a Camel in the oven, some of you have not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, but seven. The fish is waiting for you. All the Italians just know exactly what I'm talking about. But this thing brings us back to these familiar songs and this familiar story that we all have heard, and we just heard once again, we know so well. And we sang some words and heard them sung in a song that's familiar to most of us. Oh, Holy Night. And it's one of my favorite lines in all of the Christmas songs. It goes like this, the thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices. I don't know about you, but I know what weary feels like at times. And we look in our world, we know what weary feels like. And for some of us coming here tonight is just that. It's that last thing we have to do, that last thing we have to check off the list. Someone dragged you here or abused you or bribed you with something or something like that. But we all know what it feels like to be weary. We look around us in a world that seems confused at times and dark at times. It makes us feel weary. We look at our lives, we look at our families, we look at our own questions and our struggles in life. We know what it is to feel weary. So I think we can all relate to that feeling. But so much of Christmas is about the other half of that phrase. It's about this curious word that we never quite get over and is the word hope. You know, the thing that brings us back, the thing that makes us want to sing the songs and eat the seven fishes and get together as a family and open gifts and celebrate the holiday and put up the decorations and grave the lines of the grocery store. How many of you did that yesterday? God bless you. Or the mall. It's this thing called hope. And it's what so much of Christmas is about. You know, I've spent this past month watching many of the Christmas movies. Once again, that we all like to watch. Elf, National Lampluins Christmas Vacation, Christmas Story, and Yes, Die Hard. But all those movies, even Die Hard, at its end, it's about hope. It's about hope that something can be recaptured or regained. It's about hope that things can be better than they are. It's about hope that we can get back to this thing or get back to this place that we once worked. As a kid, we had this Fabric Christmas calendar we would put up every Christmas and had one ornament for each day. And it was one of my favorite things as a kid to add the ornaments until we got all the way to the end and on the last day of Christmas, December 24th, we would put the star on the top. We have one of these in our house now, except it has chocolate in it. My kids love it. I don't know if it's because of the expectation for Christmas or if it's because of the chocolate. But so much of Christmas is about anticipation. It's about what comes next. It's about what you're looking forward to tonight. It's about what's going to happen tomorrow. It's about hope. And hope is really this thing, honestly, that kind of defies logic. You know, because it was easy, we would all do it all the time. But hope is the thing that we all need. It's the thing that you need and I need. It's the thing that our world needs. And it's why we come back to these familiar places and this familiar story. And each year at Christmas, we recenter ourselves on the story you've just heard read. We sing most of the same songs and yes, at the end of the service, we all like Campbell's the same Silent Night because it's not a Christmas Eve service without that. But why do we do that? Because when we come back, we are hoping. We are hoping that we have not seen all there is to see. We are hoping that by coming back to the story, coming back to these events, coming even back to these traditions, regardless of where you find yourself on the journey of faith, that we will find something that brings us back to hope. What is hope? Hope is simply this. It's the idea that there's part of the picture that you see, but there's part of it that you don't see yet. When you have hope, you know part of the picture and maybe it's not a great picture. Maybe as you look at Christmas this year, you're looking into a broken family situation or a separate relationship or a medical diagnosis or a financial reality, where you just look ahead to the new year and you don't have a lot of hope. So we look at where we are, but we believe all of us subtly that there's part of the picture that we haven't seen yet. And the thing I think that's so magical about this holiday is it always pulls us back, even the most cynical, jaded of us, to the possibility of hope. That there's something we haven't seen, we haven't experienced yet. That's why we love these traditions, because it has one foot in something we know, but it's something we come back to over and over again. It seems mysterious, it seems magical, it seems bigger than we are. In a world that often is without an anchor point, this kind of hope anchors us. In the New Testament there's a verse written to a group of people. It was in the book of Hebrews that it was written and it talks about what faith and what hope really is all about. And it says this, faith is the assurance of what we hope for. And it's the conviction about what we do not see. It's confidence that we hope for something. And we have this assurance that even though we haven't seen the whole picture yet, that it's there and that it's leading somewhere. Now we who are followers of Jesus, the biggest reason we hope that Christmas is not that the perfect gift or the perfect dinner or the perfect family gathering is that even a thing, will somehow bring us hope, but that the reason for the season Jesus himself is hope. You know there's a lot of great things we'll do tonight and tomorrow. Memories we'll make, gifts that we'll give and receive, traditions that we'll celebrate, families that we will read and act with. But the thing I know and actually the thing I don't like about Christmas is when it's over. The tree goes back away, the gifts go away, the family goes back home. But our hope and your hope too can be in the reason for the season Jesus Christ. And that hope is not a hope that's dependent on all those things being right. For us to come back and conjure it up, it is a hope that is for every day and every single heart that lies. I don't know if you've ever waited for a phone call from a doctor, or maybe you've taken your car and you got it fixed. And you know that call when the dealership or the doctor's office shows up, you're waiting for what the damage is going to be. And have you ever heard like when one of them gets on the phone and says something like, I've got good news for you? Isn't that the best feeling ever? Things aren't as bad as you thought they were going to be. There's hope. Well, I've got some good news for you too. A little bit ago we sang these words, In Christ alone, my hope is found. And this word about the story of Jesus, this word gospel that we've heard talked about a little bit, it literally means good news. And when we come back to the traditions, when we come back to Christmas Eve, and when we hope the preacher won't go too long so we can go home and have dinner, there's something in this that sparks a little bit of hope. And if you know the rest of the story that Jesus grew up in, he was fully God and fully man, and he walked this earth, that he knew our frame and our struggle, and he ultimately was crucified on the cross and died and was buried, but rose again on the third day. We know that there's tremendous hope in that, and that's a little more of the story. But you can have all of this story and all of the hope if you will make this story that begins at Christmas, your story. And so as you go into all of the things that we're going to do these next hours and this next day, that we're all in a way looking forward to, receive the story of hope. The traditions point to it, the story of Christmas gives us a piece of it, but receiving Jesus and letting him be the one in whom poor hope is found. Whether the stop and the market goes up or down, whether the news feed is good or bad, even whether our circumstances are great or not so great, that is a hope that we can build our lives on. And so tonight, don't just leave vaguely inspired by the familiar songs and the sights, and even the story of Christmas. Make this story your story. Every day, all year long, the thrill of the weary moment, the joyous, the defiant. Jesus, we thank you that you came as a baby in a manger, and we've sung about that, and heard about that, and we've heard kids retell it, and we've heard how it celebrated around the world. We celebrate that here tonight, but we embrace the whole story that you came to save us. You came for this world to give this world hope. You came for us so that we can build our lives, not on whether things go well for us, but on something that's secure a foundation that's not shaped by Jesus Christ. I pray, women, we would be people who come back again, and this simple service that I'm giving you, simply would remind us, you came to be more than an activity seen as sentience. You came to save us from our sins. To save us from our fears, to put our feet on solid ground, to give us hope that can begin now, is not shaken by the circumstances or the events of our lives that are overgrown, and goes with us all the way into eternity. I pray we would receive that once again, and we'd receive it here, and we'd receive it now. I pray all this then with some Jesus. So there's one last tradition that we celebrate here at Long Beach Apple, and that's the singing of Silent Night. You receive a candle on the rain, and a candy and darryl will light the candles from the earth, and the wreath that they will pass the light down the road as we sing together. As always we would ask that you keep your candles upright and give a gift to our pretty folks, and we'll sing and they'll celebrate together. So all the lights are out in the room, we're just left with the lights and the candles. Let's sing. Music Silent night Holy night All is sound All is bright Rappin' on virgin mother and child Holy if it's so tender and mild Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace Silent night Holy night Shepherds play at the sight Glory streams from heaven afar Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah Christ the Savior is born Christ the Savior is born Silent night Holy night Son of God loves your light Radiant beams from Thy holy face With the dawn of redeeming grace Jesus Lord at Thy birth Jesus Lord at Thy birth Let's sing the first verse one more time. Silent night Silent night Holy night All is sound All is bright Rappin' on virgin mother and child Holy if it's so tender and mild Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace Look around you just for a second. All the lights are out, but the room is full of light. And it's because each one of us is holding on to a very small fragile but significant point of light. And so as you go into your Christmas, I want to remind you that Jesus said about you that you are the light of the world. And he also said that the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not, will not, and cannot affect the light. So as you go, even though your flame may feel fragile, even though they feel like the winds are blowing, you are the light of the world. You are the light of hope. Now carry that hope with you wherever you go. I'd ask you to extinguish your candle, hold it upright, let the wax solidify. Again, this is a Christmas gift we give to the people who clean this room. And let it, just hold it until it dries. But I want to thank you so much for being here. There's a box in the back by the way out. You can put your candle in as you go into your Christmas. And on behalf of the staff, ladies and gentlemen of the chapel, we just want to wish you very Christmas. Happy New Year and thank you so much for coming. Okay. Thank you.
