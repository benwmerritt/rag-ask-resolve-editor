When we talk about stabilizing clips in DaVinci Resolve, each clip might need a different kind of stabilization. And if you've ever tried to copy a color grade from one clip to the next, you might notice that sometimes that messes up your stabilization. Well, in this video, I'm gonna show you exactly how we can fix that and make sure that our stabilization doesn't get messed up when we copy our color grade. So let's get in the studio and I'll show you how to do it. In DaVinci Resolve here, let's say we've got a few clips that I wanna stabilize. In my timeline, I've got three different clips and to stabilize them, I would just select a clip. I'd come into my inspector right here. I'd go ahead and hit stabilize and that's gonna do the job great for me. Now let's say I did that to each one of my clips. When DaVinci Resolve goes ahead and stabilizes those clips, it's applying a little bit different settings and a little bit different stabilization to each one of those clips individually based on what is in the clip. Now the stabilization here is the exact same stabilization that you would find over in the color page. And right here in the color tab, we got the tracker window and this is where we would click on this icon and we can stabilize our clips. And if I click on each one of our clips, we can see that we have a slightly different stabilization down in our graph there. And the same is gonna be true in the edit tab. Now if you wanted to copy your color grade, for example, I've got this color grade right here already done and I wanted to copy it to these two clips. I could select my clip and just a middle mouse click right here, but then it's gonna mess up the stabilization and it's actually copying over the stabilization from that first clip and we don't wanna do that. So how do we copy our color settings without messing up the stabilization? Select the clip with your color grade. Wanna make sure you've got your stills open, so make sure your gallery's open and you're on your stills up here. We wanna right click and say grab still. So now that we've got the still, that still has the color grade information in it that we wanna use on our other clips. Now typically when you use a still, you're just gonna come in here, grab it and you can drag and drop it either here or over on the nodes and it's gonna add in that color grade for you, but it's also gonna mess up any stabilization that you've already got in this particular clip. So here's how you're gonna get around that. Make sure you do the clip you wanna apply your color grade to as selected. You see it in your viewer over here. You wanna come to your still that has the color grade you want, right click and we're gonna choose display node graph. Now when you display the node graph, you're gonna see the nodes that are part of that still right here. And in the node graph here, we can choose different things that get applied when we apply the still to another clip. So instead of applying all of these different things, we wanna apply the color. So I'm gonna go ahead and hit apply color. Now if I move this out of the way, you can see when I turn it on and off, we're not changing our zoom. I do a little before and after using Commander Control Z. You can see we didn't lose our tracking there. So we've applied the color grade, but we didn't mess with the tracking information that helps stabilize the image. And as a little bonus tip here for you, if you only want to apply certain things from this particular still, you can click on the node section here and turn on or off any of these items that you might want to copy over to another clip, or maybe you don't wanna copy. So really useful tool here to know that you don't need to mess up your stabilization in your video clips when you wanna copy over a color grade to clips that may have already been stabilized individually. And just to show you again, let's say I added in another node here, Commander Control S. And then I just threw on a quick little vignette here. We're gonna throw this guy in. Just gonna come to my curves, drop that down a little bit. So now we've got that. Let's say I wanna grab a still here. And then on this last clip right here, I wanna apply the new still to that particular clip. I can come to my still right click. I'm gonna say display node graph. That'll bring up our node graph for us. I'm gonna go to the clip section and I'm gonna say apply color. Hit close. And now on this new clip, I've got both nodes there. It didn't mess up with the tracking at all. Our tracking is still the same as it was. We can see we have individual tracking based on the graph down here for each one of our clips. But we were able to copy over the color grade from the clip that we wanted to the rest of them without messing up that stabilization. So I think that's really key of not messing up your stabilization. I spent many times where I stabilized a whole bunch of clips. Then I went through and color graded and it messed up all the stabilization. I had to go back and do it again. And that drove me nuts because it wasted time. And I figured there had to be a better way to do it. Well, this is the better way to do it. So did you guys know this one? If you did, drop comment, let me know. If you didn't, is this gonna help you out in your workflow? All right, with that said, I'm wrapping this video up and I will see you in the next video. Peace. Peace.
