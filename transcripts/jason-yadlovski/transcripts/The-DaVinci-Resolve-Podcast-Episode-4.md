## Transcript
What is going on guys welcome to the DaVinci Resolve podcast episode number four here where I look through your comments that you leave on my YouTube channel and I respond to them here in a podcast format because I can elaborate on them a little bit more we can explain things a little bit better we'll even jump into DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you how you can you know do different things if we need to but it's just another way that I can get information to you guys on how to use resolve answer your questions and how we can just hang out together and and just really continue to learn resolve because I'm always learning you guys are always learning and I thought maybe this format might be helpful for some people out there to just listen to it if you just want to listen to it but you've also got the option to watch it here on YouTube or on Spotify you can watch the video there I believe but you could just throw it on listen to it too because I know sometimes when I'm really into something I just kind of like to listen to pretty much anything about it right I want to learn more about it and podcasts are a great way to kind of learn about DaVinci Resolve here so that's what we're going to be doing today we're going to be answering some of your questions and comments that you leave on my YouTube videos but before we even get into that one thing that I realized after my last podcast that I put out is we didn't talk about any of the updates that DaVinci Resolve or Blackmagic Design I should say made in DaVinci Resolve 18.1 release when they put it out a few weeks ago and I know me and a lot of the other YouTubers out there that you guys love we've all been making tons of videos about all these different features lately that came out and I kind of just forgot to even mention it in the last podcast so I'm just going to we're going to talk about some of the things here I got a few a few things here that we'll just run over and just kind of discuss as far as things that were added in version 18.1 here I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen a lot of these things maybe there's some things that you didn't know were in there there's just there's actually there's so much in there that like I mean I could spend every day making videos about all this stuff it's just you know there's never enough time in the day to make all the videos and edit all the videos that I want to do maybe as we continue to grow the channel here I can get get a little help on editing some videos so then I can film more but anyway let's jump into some of the new features here that are found here in DaVinci Resolve 18.1 some of the new key features that they have so we've got vertical resolution options for project settings for social media so Resolve has added a bunch of new tools here to just help us make vertical videos a little bit quicker and easier so if you're making YouTube shorts you're making TikToks you're making Reels or whatever they call them on Facebook stories I guess I don't know I don't make them on Facebook but whatever you get the idea the vertical videos you've got some tools there that are going to help you make them a little bit easier and I'm actually going to have a video coming out soon on how you can quickly and easily use some of those new tools to take a video that's you know normal 16 by 9 format or whatever horizontal video and how you can adapt that for a vertical format maybe you're repurposing some content you're making some excerpts I'm pulling some parts out of my podcast here I'm going to just go through and show you how to use some of those new tools so stay tuned for that video but it's nice that they give you the option because I know a lot of people don't like the vertical video and I get it I get it but there's a lot of people who do right and that's kind of the way a lot of these platforms are going and they're all competing with each other so you got to get in there on the vertical video and you know see what you can do and it's just another way that you can try and be creative you can use resolve for it and you're just going to continue to learn how to make better videos tell better stories how to edit better all that kind of stuff so vertical videos I don't think is going anywhere at least not for a little while here so another new feature they added was the ability to select custom thumbnails if you're uploading directly to YouTube now in my opinion I'm not going to upload directly to YouTube from DaVinci Resolve the only benefit that I could see in doing that all right maybe it saves some time but the other benefit that I could see by doing that is you get to upload the markers that you have so a lot of my videos I'll put in timestamps right and in order to create those timestamps I'm going through my video in DaVinci Resolve and I'm putting markers and then I'm going to label the marker with whatever I want the timestamp to be called so that's a big plus that you don't have to go and re-copy that stuff and reformat it so that way you can upload it to the description of YouTube video if that gets uploaded automatically that's pretty sweet I like that and maybe even just the same save time you upload it like that but I don't know if you can use all the same settings and everything that I would on a typical you know export and the deliver page can I use all those same settings when I'm uploading to YouTube I don't know I'm not sure I'm gonna have to check that out so but it's kind of cool at least you can include a thumbnail if you want now quick note a lot of people want to do thumbnails and stuff in DaVinci Resolve I mean I'm a photographer so when it comes to photos or images images or still stuff like I'm not I'm not doing that in DaVinci Resolve like it's not the program for that right you can do it and you can grab stills out of there and and I think it could work out fine but it's really not the not the right program right you've got a lot of other free programs online you got things like Canva or Adobe Express or I use Photoshop because I've got Lightroom and Photoshop and the the photography plan you know from Adobe there so I don't know just an interesting little note is a lot of people want to make thumbnails and do work with images in Resolve but it's really it's really not built for that but anyway I digress the new voice isolation and voice leveler in in DaVinci Resolve so the voice isolation does a really good job of isolating your voice and and get rid of that background noise it is only available in the studio version though I did make a video about it you can check that video out I'll link it up above here if you're watching the video but you can check that out it does a really good job I'm really impressed with it and for a first generation effect or you know tool that they're putting out here does a fantastic job they also added the dialogue leveler now that is available in both the studio and the free version so you can try the dialogue leveler out in either either version there and what that's going to do is help kind of balance out your clips a little bit right between the loud parts and the quiet parts it's almost like adding a compression and it's going to kind of help auto level your your your audio levels for you or auto balance it I guess you could say adjust the gain levels kind of smooth things out a little bit and it does a pretty good job it's not too bad I keep clicking my pen here so if you're hearing clicking yeah I probably shouldn't do that let me put that down if so if you're hearing if you're testing out the dialogue level it does work pretty good I think for for me as an audio guy I'm going to use compression and dynamics and some maybe other plugins for compression versus using the dialogue leveler the dialogue leveler it just doesn't give me enough control and I just I think I would much prefer just to do it on my own using some dynamics so so that's a cool feature that they got in there vector key framing for automation in fair light I am gonna make an automation video but it's basically how to uh automation if you're not familiar with it is how to make changes over time it's almost like using keyframes right but without using keyframes if that makes any sense because you can get in there and let's say you want to change something like the pitch of a clip right you want it to go from you know a deep voice to a chipmunk voice right we can use automation automation to make that change when in that case like on the pitch effect there's no there's no keyframes right we can't keyframe it in to make those changes but you can use automation to do that you can use automation also to change audio levels and and I mean change almost anything with your audio so it's nice that they added a little more precise way to do that it looks like some great features in there that that will be taken look at here in the future fairlight grid support so you can add a grid into your timeline in fair light that just helps you edit to the beat a little bit better now hopefully they add that functionality into the edit tab because if you checked out my video I made on that again I'll link it up above here somewhere if you checked out that video it it does a good job but it's hard to edit your video and change your video in fair light and you can't see the grid in the edit tab so while it's pretty good and I like it and there's ways to work with it I think it would have better functionality if we could get it into the edit tab so I don't know some something to keep in mind maybe they'll they'll continue to to work on that and make it you know better and give us more options of of working with our video and how we can edit our video using that that grid they changed some menus around so you know the reorganize and streamline the view menu some things kind of got moved around a little bit one of the things that that I lost and couldn't find was the project preset settings in your project manager it's actually up under the three dots now I made a video about that because I was like hey where do these things go you know sometimes they move and we're like yo what happened these things I can't find it so things did move around a little bit just keep that in mind the speed editor functionality got improved on the edit page and I don't have the speed editor but if you do there's some new features in there you might want to look into and and new functionality that might be helpful for you while you're you're editing using the the speed editor there subtitle caption properties can now be overridden individually so they did make a whole bunch of improvements to subtitles here in resolve and I'm gonna I gotta make a video on that too to kind of update my subtitle video that I made just to show you the different tools and features that they added on how we can you know make some changes there to subtitles but there are some some good updates there and I believe I read somewhere that they actually made a preset option available for you so let's say you set up your your subtitles a certain way for you know all your videos or whatever you must save that as a preset so you don't have to do it every time I read that they did make that a option to save a preset for your subtitles so I have to look into that find out how to do it but again another video I gotta make there's always so many videos to make you know so many videos to make let's see what else do we got here we have the magic mask was added into the fusion page so if you do a lot of fusion work and you're like hey let me get the magic mask over there looks like black magic design listen and now you can get that over in the fusion page so I don't do a whole lot of fusion work at least at this point just haven't had the need to I guess and not that my computer can't handle it can handle some fusion I'm on the M1 Mac mini over here but yeah I just I just haven't gotten in there a whole ton occasionally get in there and it's pretty sweet it's a lot of fun actually got to get in there a little bit more you know a little bit more so let's see what else do we have in here some things in the edit page right here you can select delete realign the transitions a little bit easier they added some functionality to that you can edit and trim gaps so I did make a video about that about what I call it gaps and tracks I think where you know you can actually work with those gaps a little bit instead of having to you know just select and delete it you can ripple delete in the gaps and stuff like that so that's kind of cool so in the edit index here's another one that I like that they added in that's the ability to open the edit index and just see your markers right you got a couple little tabs at the top there you can just click on your markers that's pretty sweet because I'm using the markers all the time like I said when I want to come up with with um what are those called the the chapters youtube chapters that's what they're called so when I'm coming up with youtube chapters uh I use the markers in DaVinci resolve to mark where I want those chapters to be so then I can put them in the description of my video and and then we can you know have have our our our chapters there in our youtube video so I like that they added that functionality in the edit index so when it comes to fusion like I said you got the magic mask in there you've got resolve effects like 3 keyers the dust buster lens flare stop motion you can use all those in fusion now uh let's see there's a new media mode media in background node to let you access edit track composites so I mean if if you're into that and that's what you need that that's a pretty cool feature right there looks like some gpu acceleration got added to a few things in there jumping into the color tab you've got the sky replacement I've seen a bunch of videos on this really cool I'm going to get in there try it out myself because my question is a lot of the videos that I've seen people use like you know real good high quality footage and it you know usually it does a pretty good job of replacing the sky but what if I get out there with my 5D mark 4 and I'm doing some kind of little vlog thing and I got the sky in the background there and I want to use my own clip and I want to place the sky in my own clip now I expect it to work better on a higher quality clip right I mean kind of makes sense but what if I use my own clip how does it work in there and then what if I even use like an iPhone clip right how how well would it work on that I don't know I'm kind of curious so I'm going to make a video about that with those examples I don't know because I'm kind of curious myself you know it always things always work better when you've got real high quality great footage and stuff got a powerful computer all that kind of stuff you know but when you're just you know a lot of people have budget kind of items your budget camera maybe you're just using your phone how do these kind of effects and features work when you're not using super high-end stuff I don't know that's what we're going to find out some other things in the color tab support for motion blur for textures with the resolve surface track tracker you can separate RGB controls for film grain Dolby cinema trims all kinds of different stuff in here a tracking works over transition extents which is pretty pretty good I mean we want that tracker for tracking something to work from one end of the clip all the way to the other right so that's good here's an interesting one improved eye sharpening behavior when you're using the fair light effects face refinement I thought about making a tutorial about that face refinement getting in there tweaking up my face a little bit you know see if we can make it a little bit better I don't know maybe I'll still do that but it's nice to know that they're improving that and I've tried it a little bit in the past this seems to work pretty good I don't know it's kind of cool but maybe something I'll try out again here in the in the near future you've got some improved qualifier menus improved power window menus pressing shift down and the loop toggles the playhead mode I'm not exactly sure what that means and effects inspector shows an explicit delete icon so if you want to delete an effect from the inspector you can hit a delete icon they've got that with other effects in like the edit tab you know you can easily hit that little trash can and delete things so kind of cool fair light we talked about a bunch of the new features they got there already I've gotten a couple videos on that stuff again going to make some more videos about some of the new tools they have in there it was a lot of updates in fair light and as an audio guy I'm like yeah yeah black magic design you go dudes so really excited about all that kind of stuff looks like there was some some codec updates and things as well as just general performance upgrades up to you know if I look down my little list here we're 10 times faster 2 times faster 5 times faster with all these different different things in there they just kind of really you know continue to make resolve better run better run smoother which is what we want right we want a program that's going to work for us and if there's one thing I've heard from a lot of people that come over from adobe premiere and I'm not knocking it I've never even used it before but man they just they're frustrated that things don't work it it crashes it it doesn't just work right we want things to just work it's part of the reason why I use a Mac it just it just works all the time you know but I think black magic is adding functionality to DaVinci resolve that make it just work okay and that's that's what we want and you've got a whole bunch of other improvements here that that that were added to but those are just some of the some of the ones that I think are kind of cool here I mean I you know the list goes on and on there's every time and an update comes out here for DaVinci resolve I'm just impressed with how well black magic listens to its users and how well they can just incorporate things that that we as users of the program really want so that's just some some highlights there of some cool things that got added throw that down there now let's get into answering some of your guys questions here and let's see let's get a time check where we at here how long we've been doing this already let me say hey we're about 20 minutes all right so you got 20 minutes updates there just real quick there like I said there's a whole bunch more stuff in there that's awesome but now let's get into answering some of your comments here on the youtube all right so just jumping in the questions here we've got Stryfek one Stryfek one any other editing software you could suggest DaVinci resolve won't let me record audio any that are simpler to use so if you're having problems recording voiceovers or recording a microphone into DaVinci resolve a couple things you need to do and I'm not sure why a lot of people get get hung up on this but here's the process for getting set up to record in a DaVinci resolve first before you even open resolve get your microphone set up on your computer make sure it's plugged in jump into your setting your sound settings make sure you see your microphone make sure it's there and make sure that the levels usually you can set your levels there on your computer are at you know something decent maybe at 50% okay then once you're set up you see it on your computer then you want to go ahead and jump into DaVinci resolve so if I go ahead and jump into DaVinci resolve here what we want to do then is come up here to the DaVinci resolve menu I'm assuming you're already in your project you started a project okay so jump into your preferences when preferences opens up you want to come to the system setting video and audio i slash o and right here input device you want to make sure your microphone is selected right here so hit that drop down pick your microphone make sure it's selected here then you can go ahead and hit save now you have to have a timeline created so you don't need video in a timeline you can just record your audio right into the timeline if you want but jump over into the musical notes at the bottom which we call Fairlight and then at the top go the Fairlight menu patch input output now when that comes up you get this is what it's going to look like and on the source side you got to select your audio inputs on the destination side you want to select track inputs and now all you're going to do is select your microphone in my case it's my Evo4 I know it's on the first one and then you want to patch that into whatever audio track that you might have now if you named your audio track it's going to come up as a name here in this project that I just opened randomly they're not named it's just audio one audio two audio three so that's how you do it you got to patch it and then once you patch it you're halfway there right you should have the microphone patch and resolve it should be good to go now when you're ready to start recording let's say I put it on my track number four here I want to hit that record button right there that arm to record so that is going to arm my track that means get it ready to record and I don't know why but my levels keep jumping down here as well as my volume I don't know what's going on there sometimes we're having little issues here with the audio interface or the podcast I don't know what's going on with that anyway I digress so once you've armed your track to record then you're going to go ahead and come up here and hit the record button you're going to go ahead and record your voice over and your your microphone should be recording now if you're not hearing yourself you don't see any meters moving one thing you can check get fairlight menu at the top input monitoring style so this is how can you monitor what you're recording right maybe you don't want to hear anything you have mute selected you can use it on auto that's typically what I use or you can use it when you're only when you hit record you actually start recording will you hear something and I would recommend using headphones because if you're using your speakers you're probably going to get some feedback going on there um and you don't want to have to worry about that so um definitely use some headphones if you're recording into resolve and and and make sure that um or actually or if you're using speakers just make sure your speakers are turned down low so that could work now you might be asking well where's my where's my recording go well if we come on over to our project settings so your little gear icon at the bottom here bring up your project settings and if we go to capture and playback come down to the crack capture and save clips to right here whatever's in there that's where your clips will be saved right so if I'm recording for a project generally I'm going to come to browse and then I'm going to go select my project directory right that I have in my hard drive because I don't want the recorded clips go into some random spot with some random name I want it to go where I want where I want it to go so go ahead browse and then you can select where you want it to go and that's how you get set up to make a voiceover and put it where you want so that uh that covers voiceovers but a lot of people get tripped up on that for some reason all right next one hi so you have a video where you automatically make the transition between two audio segments please give me a link to it I believe you just use the keyboard shortcut commander control t I believe you select your two two clips and then use commander control t I do have a video on adding transitions it's probably my overall transition video too my transition crash crash course so so yeah so you can check that out if you want but yeah so Bruce Peel here says hello Jason I got a response from a studio could you please explain it to me all right so sounds like he submitted some audio and got some comments back and isn't sure what to do so he says so it says main audio fail audio levels in your video are out of balance so what does that mean to me that means your your levels um are not good right so maybe you recorded a voiceover or you've got dialogue in there where do we want those to be for dialogue levels you want that to be around minus 10 db give or take a little bit you want it to be in that range before you start working with other things like compression and dynamics and things like that to continue to refine your audio so if they're saying your levels are out of balance I'm I'm going to assume that that might be part of the problem maybe your background music is competing with your your your dialogue if you have dialogue the next part of the the comment here says audio levels should be a minimum of minus 24 LUFS and audio must not clip so when it comes to LUFS levels LUFS levels is the overall loudness of your audio which is different than the individual levels of our audio for a particular track such as dialogue music sound effects whatever it might be so it really just sounds like that you need to go back and take a look at your audio and here's what I would do I would first go through each one of your tracks and make sure you've got good levels like I said for dialogue you want to be around that minus 10 db range maybe minus eight maybe minus 12 somewhere in that range is is going to be a good place for you to start if you've got music if same thing I would kind of keep it in that range that minus 10 if there's no dialogue on top of the music if you've got dialogue on top of the music you want to drop that music back to maybe anywhere between I'd say minus 18 and minus 27 28 db really depends on the music clip it depends on your your your dialogue you got to listen to it in in addition to looking at the levels right but that's kind of where I would put it when it comes to sound effects that's another ball game there depends on the effect because some of them are quieter than others some you want to be more subtle some you want to be a little more in your face so that's going to vary a little bit more but I would start by looking at individual tracks now once you've got your levels good and it sounds like a good mix because not only do you want to set those levels you got to listen to it right audio work requires a good ear and it just takes time to develop that good ear so does it sound good does it sound like it makes sense do things you know can you hear the dialogue above everything else does it sound good use your ear and make that decision and if it doesn't go back and read readjust some of your levels a little bit if it does well maybe now we're ready to start taking a look at you know our overall loudness level and with the video that you commented on the loudness metering and resolve I show you how to check your loudness levels in there so what I would do is ask whoever you're submitting this video to what are the loudness levels what do I need to meet so here it says a minimum of minus 24 which is kind of typical I think for broadcast work if you're on youtube here the the the max that you could do is minus 14 loves and that's going to give you enough volume for your viewers so that they don't have to you know boost up the volume lower the volume and that kind of stuff so you want to try and be as close to that as you can so audio level should be around a minimum of 24 I would find out what the maximum is as well so you can work in that range and in this video I kind of show you how you can adjust that overall level but before you can adjust that overall level you have to have a good mix going on and you have to have good track levels and everything set first so so keep that in mind and then the comment continues the stereo mix must be center balanced stereo image is not stereo so I'm not sure exactly how you did your your clips here there is a stereo image effect there that you can use maybe you just need to change your tracks to mono right maybe you've got things pan too much to different uh different places different speakers or whatever I don't know if you're trying to do 5.1 I really don't know the situation more but but if you just need stereo tracks then just make sure you've got them set up as stereo um and I'm not sure what they mean by stereo image is not stereo because I don't know how you have your stuff set up but maybe change things to mono and see if that helps it also continues the low quality audio can impact your title's performance all narrator audio is pan to the right so you can pan things right but when it comes to dialogue you probably want that coming out of your center channels or or or in a mono track right where unless you know somebody in the frame is over on the right or over on the left and you want it to hear like it's coming from there but it sounds like in this case you're narrating something and the audio is all pan to the one side now you can make it a mono track that's going to fix your pan it's just going to you know make it come out of both left and right channels equally or you can use some of the other tools uh in resolve um there's a stereo fixer effect that you can use that says hey take my right channel and boom put it out to both the right and the left channel so you can do that so it really looks like you just need to get in there and um and and and work with that audio a little bit more maybe you just got to learn a little bit more on on how to work with the audio and what to do with it um and I've got tons of videos on that on how to set levels how to do things and how to balance things um and how to set loves levels like like the loudness video there so um so you can check out some of those videos but uh that's kind of my my advice there i'm going to respond to them uh in the comment too um a little more brief than that but but yeah that's that's kind of how I would approach that creative zitty creative zit zit zit zit says hey jason I have a question for you previously I saw you did a resizing video for youtube shorts and tiktoks but I'm interested in building my youtube banners in resolve there doesn't appear to be a preset for it can you make a video on making youtube banners without required additional software outside of resolve they're supposed to be 2048 by 1152 and less than six megabytes thanks love your channel by the way so this goes back to what I was talking about a little bit earlier where people are trying to make images in resolve and resolves really not built for it although you can do it um if you don't have anything else you can do it but basically all you have to do is set up a timeline for your resolution there 2048 by would you say 1152 set up your your timeline for that and then just drop in whatever you want drop in your images color grade it um and then you know you can grab a still of that and I think it should grab the still that's the size of your timeline there and boom there you go now if it's I don't know if it's going to be six megs or not um you may need to shrink it down I don't I don't know but it should be pretty straightforward and pretty easy um so that's how that's how I would do that XZ or ZX Gamer says I can't do it on DaVinci Resolve 18.4 does not work in DaVinci 18 and that is making your timeline a full width um I made the video on version 17 and pretty sure you can do it here so I'm in the edit tab down here now I want the timeline to go all the way across the screen how do I do that you have to just turn off a few things I'm going to turn off my mixer turn off my media pool my effects now the timeline's all the way across um if you have your inspector open there's a little icon right here that says expand so maybe that's what you're seeing there and it's not letting the timeline be the entire width of the screen so you want to click on that little guy and that's going to help you uh make the timeline the whole width of the screen and same thing on the other side on the left hand side here with the media pool or the edit index or effects whatever if you got that open and you want to see the whole timeline you got to click this little guy right here and it's going to extend that timeline and I'm in version 18.1.1.1.1.2.9er no I made that part up but um but so it works you just got to hit the right settings there and uh and it should work for you question on it to the be in DaVinci Resolve when I right click on the clip there's no option for a compound clip a new compound clip uh so the only reason I could see that you wouldn't get that option is if you're only selecting one clip and actually even if I do that here new compound clip it seems to work I don't know why you're not getting the compound clip option there if I select multiple clips right click a new compound clip I don't know guy it's it's there for me it should work I don't know why it wouldn't there's a question from Jerry he said I've been watching wondering what a color generator is it's and the color generator is a color generator effect here in resolve I thought it was complicated device but you simplified it and made it a go-to tool so the yeah the color generator actually if I just jump in to resolve here is uh is a pretty sweet tool you can find it in your effects library uh let's see where you at here effects library boom effects are you in this one where are you where are you generator and where are you color generator sorry we're going open effects filters and color generator here you are here you are resolve effects color generator right here so what's really cool with this is that you can drop it on a clip that's uh like a png or something um let me see do I have a clip in this in this project here if I drop it on on here and what it's going to do is allow you to change the color of your object so I have a little animated logo down here now kind of whites it out a little too much here um but if I come to my effect the color generator I can you know change the color of it say maybe I want to make it so yeah and then I can drop the blend back for it a little bit but it helps you quickly change the colors and add color to different elements in your videos it's a pretty cool tool and I use it quite a bit on especially images or pngs or maybe I got an arrow or something on the screen that I want to change the color of uh it makes it really quick and easy to be able to change the color of things so color generator check it out if you haven't used it before pretty sweet tool all right so here's one from uh rv a 6a driver he said pretty new to resolve this video was absolutely great and I will now subscribe thanks man appreciate your sub and this is on a the multicam editing in DaVinci Resolve 16 video uh multicam crash course which I need to update I mean everything pretty much still applies but I need to make a new one for 18 because it's super helpful video for a lot of people said I have a question I recorded a lot of video but never paid much attention to the difference in frame rate and in single cam it's really not an issue but when I want to uh evolve and get better I'm struggling with a lot of different frame rates and using multicam clips when I make a multicam cam of my camera angles it's way off in difference in speed and I can't figure out how to fix it so sounds like he's having a problem here because he filmed in different frame rates I gotta get a little coffee there man I love coffee every morning I just wake up looking forward to a nice cup of coffee anybody else out there will I like that I mean ah dude I just just just love me some coffee all right anyway I digress uh so one of the problems he's having here is he's trying to make multicam clips but when you've got different frame rates obviously things are not going to line up so first and foremost you want to film in consistent frame rates right so you're making your video you want all your cameras if you're filming a multicam clip to be in you know 24 frames per second for example you want them to match now if you don't have them matching or you've already recorded it you're trying to work with what you got you can take your different frame rate clips and just drop them into the timeline and it should you know adjust and they should play back in real time but they might look a little jittery a little bit stuttering um you might run into some issues there if you want to change the frame rate of a of a clip you've got a few ways that you can do that if I come to the media pool here let's say for example I got this guy I'm going to select the clip uh actually let me select the clip myself I'm going to right click and come to uh where are you clip attributes right here and that's going to bring up your clip clip attributes window and here under the video section we've got video frame rate you can change the frame rate of the video now it's going to change the way it plays back obviously because you're changing the frame rate but um in this case maybe you wanted to show something in slow motion and I filmed it in 60 frames per second well I can go ahead and change it down to 30 frames per second and then you're going to get a buttery smooth slow-mo clip right assuming you're in a 30 frame per second timeline so that's one way that you can change your clips you can also change them in the timeline itself if you again select your clip clip right click clip attributes you're going to get that same window and you can change your video frame rate right here now if you change your frame rate or if for some reason you know things just aren't working out so smoothly one of the things you can try is um for example let's just say that you filmed a clip at 30 frames per second but you're working in a 24 frame per second timeline when you play it back it looks a little choppy it's not so smooth one of the things you can try is to select your clip open up your inspector up here and then come on down to retime and scaling and when you open that up you've got retime process here you can go ahead and change this guy to optical flow and that's just going to help blend together the frames a little bit better when resolve's trying to figure out all right how do I put this thing together because the frame rates don't match but i'm gonna go ahead and do the work for you how do I blend this together a little bit better so you can use optical flow to do that and under motion estimation if you go ahead and change this uh you know the default is standard faster but if you go down the list there and go all the way down to speed warp which is really intense on your machine by the way um you can you can tell resolve to do a better job of estimating the motion say in between frames right let's say maybe um I want to make a clip slow motion but I only filmed it in 24 frames per second well let's say I make that you know I double it and make it 50 frames per second and now it looks jittery right because I don't have enough frames there well if I come into motion estimation here and I go to something like enhance better or I mean speed warp if your computer can handle it I'm back many here can't handle speed warp you know it's a little little intense um but if you if you change it to speed warp then resolve is going to do a good job of estimating and recreating those frames and I'm getting a little pop in here what's that going on here getting some interference can you guys hear that because I can hear that sometimes that happens a lot of times I find it's a cell phone believe it or not it's a cell phone that causes interference when it's by my microphone cord or my headphones cord that goes into my audio interface like what's up with that I don't I don't quite understand why that is I don't know I don't know but uh yeah if you're trying to fix a problem with your microphone getting feedback and and stuff like that check out see if your phone is close to the cord anyway getting back to our frames our clips here so anyway motion estimation is going to allow resolve to do a better job of estimating and recreating those frames on your clip when there might not be any frames there to create and I've got a video on that I'll link to that up above here so you guys can check that out but yeah real quick just jumping back I don't know I'm going to have to check on the recording if you heard that but there was a little bit of static and like popping going on in the record I could hear it in what else monitoring here and I found that that happens when I keep my cell phone too close to my headphones cord or too close to my audio interface or too close to my microphone for some reason the interference just creeps right in I don't I don't know why that is and usually things are shielded pretty well as far as you know the clips and things but yeah if you're running into issues definitely check that out check your cords check your cables make sure there's no interference between things just just some things to keep in mind and take a look at if you're running into audio issues when you're trying to record and we're trying to record a podcast here we got audio problems that's a big problem all right moving on let's see what do we got next here here's a good one from a seb s he says hello do you know if there are a feature if there is a feature that allows us hold on I you know sometimes I just have problems reading because let me do this again do you know if they are a feature so let me translate if there is a feature that allows you to update a power bin when you add new elements into an original folder okay I think I kind of paraphrased that good enough so what he's asking is if I've got a folder on my hard drive and let's say I keep all my assets that I want my power bins I keep everything in that one folder I drag them into my power bin now everything's in my power bin so I can see it in each of my each one of my projects can I add stuff into that folder on my hard drive and have it automatically appear in the power bin and that would be really good if it was like an automatic sync thing and I don't think it works like that if I come to my power bins here let's just take a look it I don't think it automatically syncs because even if I right click on it auto sync now sort you can sort everything you can import but there is not a way I don't think to have it automatically sync from your hard drive that would be great because if you look at my power bins here I've got ones for you know for transition sound effects for music you can see my different music sources that I use here sound effects and it would be great because I keep these in a folder on my hard drive name the same thing if I you know say a motion ray I added in an asset there and it automatically appeared over here that would be that would be sweet if I go to add a new bin no I don't I don't I don't think so re relink clips for selected bin no that just links to where it is usually what I'll do if I'm not sure if I got everything I'll just grab all of it and throw it in again because it's not going to duplicate stuff when I come and drop it back into a power bin you're not going to get multiple items of things um but that would be a sweet feature but unfortunately now they can't it doesn't automatically sync up between your hard drive and power windows but that would be an awesome feature black magic design if you happen to be listening to this which I don't know if you are I doubt it but if somebody was from black magic that would be a really cool feature to add in I had a nice little chat here with Sebastian friendrick friendrick Sebastian friendrick he's got a youtube channel here talks about to venture resolve a lot cool guy I like his videos I've checked him out I'll watch his stuff I posted a photo here you know asking people what camera you would use because I got the c100 I'm testing out the black magic 6k g2 camera and then I've got my 5d mark form you know what would you use and we had a nice little little chat back back and forth here you know he likes the the pocket cinema 6k g2 and great camera by the way I'm going to make a video on that it's a lot of fun to use but just want to give Sebastian a little shout out if you haven't checked out his channel go check him out he is a he's a cool guy and has a lot of great stuff stuff on his channel so Sebastian man hey what's up bro keep it going keep it going all right moving on what do we got next here so if you are having problems you'll lost some files you don't have backups if you can find your project dot dp files uh john it's not john joe I don't even know something giraffe I'm not even sure Mr. Giraffe here I said if he's worried with the most word black sometimes we get a little tongue tied jersey man you got to slow down jersey come on jersey go back to jersey all right I was worried the most recent version of DaVinci resolve at the time of this writing DaVinci resolve 18 would not this would not apply and in this video I showed you how to load your backups if you only got backups on your your hard drive you can't find them in the project manager they're not loading up how do we use those project dot dp files and uh and restore them and the method does work like I've said before a lot of the videos at least that I've made in that many other creators have made too from say version 15 all the way up until now all those tips and techniques for the most part are still going to work and still apply um I should like remake a lot of those videos and just call it you know DaVinci resolve 18 because people think that they don't work still you know if it's from version 16 but all these things they they still work so so definitely if you're having a problem when you see you know as a solution from version 16 you're like ah man it's not going to work in version 18 give it a try because there's a good chance that it's still going to work there so um yeah so keep that in mind all right we got a question here from John Sellers he says thank you Jason watching your videos on voice isolation and dialogue leveler have been extremely helpful however I am having issues rendering from the edit page my audio track and video tracks are fine on the timeline but when I go to render the export uh go to render on quick export it renders out out of sync do you have any suggestions I haven't seen that problem happen before at least not for me I don't know why they would be out of sync when you render them one thing I would try is go into the deliver page and render it from there I don't use any of the quick export render options from the the edit page or I think you could do it in the cut page too I jump right over into the deliver page because I've got my preset set up on on the exports that I use all the time for all of my youtube videos so just go in there boom one click add a name good to go um so I would try that first if it's out of sync maybe double check in your timeline that everything matches up but if it's good in your timeline it should render out and be okay um so jump in and deliver page give it a try there and see how that works out all right here's one from Wayne two days ago he says yo could you make a video about the playback in DaVinci Resolve 18 DaVinci Resolve will not render any of my adjustment clips I want to have a smooth review but it doesn't work all right so I do have a video on it and actually I linked it to him um in in a response to this comment that um there's a bunch of things that you can try that are going to help your playback and the things in my video I think what was it called hold on I can bring it up right here real quick uh four tips or tips for smoother playback in DaVinci Resolve just go ahead and meet that guy real quick uh yeah four tips for smooth playback in DaVinci Resolve 17 these still apply in version 18 and I'm actually I'm going to make another one for smooth playback here in DaVinci Resolve 18 I'm going to include some of these tips as well as some more tips on how to get smooth playback in Resolve but if we jump into DaVinci Resolve the quickest and easiest thing to try is just to come up to your playback menu timeline resolution proxy resolution and changes from full down to quarter or half so you're going to see on screen it's going to look you know not as crisp you could say as sharp and stuff but it's going to play back a whole lot smoother for you so I would I would change that first the other thing you can do is render cache right here this is um allowing Resolve to kind of pre-render things in the background when you're not working say you get up go grab a cup of joe or something um you can have Resolve render those things in the background um like transitions or if you have effects applied to clips and things it'll render that in the background so I use smart because Resolve kind of decides what it wants to do you can do user and set what you want to render in the background um in the preferences and if you do that the other thing I like to do is make the time that DaVinci Resolve waits to start you know creating these these renders and to do that come to your project settings we have master settings here and if you scroll down you've got optimized media render cache here and right here enable background caching after I think the default is five seconds but I say one second because as soon as I'm done get to work Resolve start working in the background there so I change that to one um you can also create proxy media and if you're going to do that or proxy files if you're going to do that you can select the format for them right here so you've got all the options in there select what what uh quality that you want to use um so that's one option you can do that and if you want to create the proxy media you can just come to anything in your your media pool you can select it right click come on down to generate proxy media right here and then you can go ahead and allow Resolve to uh create that proxy media for you and one thing you can select uh when you're using the proxy media is come in here and you want to say use optimized media if available so you optimize media and proxy media it's the same thing essentially but proxy media you have full control over where to put them and then move them around and that kind of stuff you can give them to other people optimized media is all managed by DaVinci Resolve so that's the difference but as far as the files it's really kind of like the same thing uh and then proxy handling here you can either disable them prefer the proxies or prefer the camera originals now when you're using the proxies you don't have to come and turn this off when you're done with your project and you want to render it out Resolve will automatically use your high res files when it goes to render out so um so that's one thing keep in mind if you have a lot of color grading on your on your clips you can disable the color grades and that's going to help your playback so up here you have this little I don't know icon whatever this I don't even know what's called the bypass color grades and fusion effects so if I turn that on it's going to change let me just get to myself here so you can see boom there's my color grade there's without my color grade that's the the the raw file right there so if I if I'm having trouble playing back I change those other settings you can turn this off and then you're able to play back and uh and and that's going to help make it a little bit easier on your computer too the other thing you can do is you want to edit your footage in a 1080 timeline so if you're recording in 4k 6k 8k 12k who even does all that I don't know I don't film in 4k that black magic camera I'm trying out man 4k files are huge dude they take up so much space gosh I'd have to make get so many more hard drives and more computer all this anyway I digress edit in the 1080 timeline and then when you're done change that timeline up to a 4k timeline and then you should be uh good to go because the 1080 timeline is going to play back easier it's going to work better um and if you have 4k footage or higher-risk footage when you change your timeline back resolve will just scale everything and it'll just work out fine so um I do everything in a 1080 timeline I export in 4k to you know scale it up and that seems to to work out fine for me so so that's some ways that you can get some some better play back there in in DaVinci Resolve any version pretty much any version that you got all right here's a good one from Troy Bowman here he says uh hey Jason I was watching one of your videos on how to restore a backup file in DaVinci Resolve 18 I opened up DaVinci Resolve clicked on the project file and accidentally disconnected the database two weeks worth of work anyway to reconnect the database of a master project file so if it's the database that um that you lost yeah we can we can hook that back up so if you come into your project uh manager here you've got our database over here this way database right here and uh I would come down here I'd go add project library and now they call the database a library same thing database library whatever uh you can go to connect here uh that might work or if uh well you don't need to create a new one so I'm assuming you're going to go to connect here and then you go hit browse here and then go find wherever your database or your project library wherever it's stored um and it should link it back up for you so it should be as easy as that as far as I know I've never unlinked one and had to relink it but that's how you should be able to do it there and uh yeah I think that should work for you all right here's a question from Veros uh five ways to adjust audio levels in DaVinci Resolve in my rendered videos the audio volume gets automatically changed in some parts uh why is this um all right so that I don't know why that would happen there's no reason that that should happen unless you've got some effect on your channel or you've got something going on there um that is causing it to happen otherwise there's no reason that the levels should change and I did comment that and it looks like he said maybe obs was changing it um when he was I guess recording maybe or maybe he brought the video in obs to play it or something I don't know but yeah there's no reason that it should change automatically if um if you're having audio that's changing if there's nothing on the channel there's no effects or no automation or anything like that you shouldn't have any problems there so not sure what might be going on there here's a good question voiceovers by Keith what's going on Keith on my uh how to record voiceovers in Resolve 17 video says thanks for the explanation in your opinion could you use DaVinci strictly for professional voiceover work or would it be better to use something like audacity or Adobe audition etc so if you're just doing voiceover work yeah there's no reason why you can't use DaVinci Resolve to do your voiceover work it's got the tools in there that you need you can record right into it um and I'm assuming you're only needing the audio you don't need the video because you're just doing the voiceover work so there's no reason that you can't use DaVinci to do it um you can also you know use any kind of vst plug in there in Resolve so a lot of the things and tools that you might use in another program such as you know audition or or um you know some of the other audio only programs you can use them right in Resolve so there's really no reason you can't get in there and and use Resolve I would I would totally use it try it out I mean if you're doing it for a living definitely test it out first make sure it works good um and and it's giving you the results that you want but um you do have a lot of tools in there it's not quite a full DAW but if you're not recording you know a whole bunch of multi-track stuff and music and and all that maybe from voiceover work I think Resolve could do just fine so um yeah I would go ahead and give it a shot all right here's one from make your audio sound professional uh from read Redeema Redeema is it possible to merge audio and video into the same track I get confused having a separate audio and video track thank you so you can't put it together uh if you're in the edit tab here obviously we've got two different tracks and I think based on some of my my uh you know comments back and forth it just gets confusing when it's like oh my audio tracks a couple below and like where is everything so you can't make them appear as one track in the edit page here but if you jump over into the cut page then you can see it appears here or you can make it appear I believe as uh as one track um where is it come on so maybe the view over here is going to help help just make it look a little bit clearer for you especially if you only have one audio track and and and one video track that you have synced up I think they appear together when you're in the cut tab I I'm not 100% I don't use the cut tab much I I actually I have a video that I'm going to make uh of a soccer game I filmed called uh I don't know something like I only use the edit tab I'm trying to first you know trying to cut tab for the first time DaVinci Resolve guy tries to cut tab for the first time I don't know something to that effect because I've never used it and I've got a lot of footage to get through and make a little video out of like a little highlight reel so uh it's on my list of things to try here because I just don't use the cut a tab cut tab cut a tab I just don't use the cut tab I use the edit tab it's just what I do because I find in the past I always ended up in the edit tab anyway so why bother going to the cut tab I'm going to end up in the edit tab anyway I don't know I don't know all right here's a comment on uh looks like our last podcast yeah hello my friend cool podcast you have a video on or can you help with explaining how to do this I have one video of clip of a green lawn I have a second video clip of a duller green lawn is there a way to adjust the color to take an eyedropper from oh eyedropper to a frame from the first green lawn and color the second lawn the exact same color so you would do that in the color tab right so if you jump into color here you could just have your both your clips up and really it's just you got to do some basic color grading to to match up your colors right you can use the eyedropper tool here to select your your white balance make sure your white balances match you can use your qualifier here to select you know a certain color say in the one maybe there's a little bit um you know more yellowish color that you want to be more green well you can go in there and use the qualifier to select that and then you can go ahead come back here and make adjustments to those colors you can use your curves to make adjustments to those colors you got a lot of ways to do it um if you're a photographer I'm assuming maybe you're familiar with you know editing photos and things like that so it's very similar on how you would do it here in resolve you know you can make your selections and and um work with the color in the color tab here and you should be able to match them up pretty good and get them get them pretty close and looking looking pretty good so uh color tab that's the way to go for that one here's one I got this comment a couple times so I will just address it right here 10 10 DaVinci resolve tips you should know um there was a point where I was showing when your clips are offset uh you know the amount of frames that they're off appear in a red box and I had said it's off by 18 seconds but it's actually 18 frames my bad I apologize about that so if I jumped back in here you know and for example if I go like this these little red numbers here it's off by you know the number of frames uh I said seconds it was framed so y'all guys got a point there you guys are right so credit to you guys for uh catching me on that one here's a comment that uh that I was happy to see so I've got a DaVinci resolve 17 crash course but I mean everything still applies to 18 but I want to make a DaVinci resolve 18 crash course I really want to do before the end of the year because I know a lot of people getting you know new computers updating stuff and people are going to get going at you know into the new year with DaVinci resolve new people to the program um and I really want to have a good crash course for people to learn the basics um so I'm gonna make that and I got a cool little bunch of footage that I filmed uh making s'mores actually and that's what we're going to use to make that DaVinci resolve 18 crash course so stay tuned for that that's in the works and uh yeah just keep your eyes open for that all right here's a good one uh let's see you said um uh well it's on my crash course this comes when it comes to exporting your projects yeah I said that I use a 30 000 bit rate for exporting 1080 footage and they're asking what bit rate do I use if I'm exporting 1440 or 4k footage so if I just jump into resolve I'll show you my presets here uh I have a 1080 to 4k so I'll just leave my timeline at 1080 but export it at 4k if I click that what they're talking about is the quality right down here and restrict to and I use 90 000 um that seems to work out pretty good gives me high quality looks good comes out in 4k it gives me the better vp9 codec on youtube uh so I'll use 90 000 there and if I'm doing just a 1080 because sometimes uh depending on my project I try to you know export my 1080 timeline in in 4k like that versus just changing my timeline to 4k because my footage isn't in 4k everything is 1080 um if I'm just exporting in 1080 here I'll use 40 000 is what I use now I used to do 30 000 and uh just for the heck of it I was like you know I'm pumped out of the 40k we're gonna do 40k so that's that's the settings that I use there when I'm exporting my videos let's see if we can get another one or two in here and then that's gonna be it um and we're gonna wrap this up all right here is a comment from another podcast guy the uh the work with purpose podcast I've seen him around my channel a lot dude thanks so much for being a part of the community here he says great stuff I wanted to ask about your white balance card any recommendations for getting one if I just record my podcast with an iPhone and a mac camera uh in the past I've used just a white piece of paper and held it up close to me while filming with the light shining on it uh so what can I oh so can I do white balance in post thanks for following up wishing you the best in your podcast journey uh randy randy thanks so much randy uh the work with purpose podcast so yeah so my white balance card um this one right here I don't even know where this came from but that's mine right there um where did I get oh it came actually oh okay it says right on it from Scott Kelby's the adobe photoshop cc book for digital photographers 2014 release so this one is uh it's it's a gray card right so it's not actually white it's actually was it 50 right I think uh technically for proper white balance so I'll use this and and it works out good you can use a white sheet of paper I used to do that a long time ago too uh just to set my white balance um but yeah I would hold up you know hold up a white sheet of paper so you can at least you know get in the ballpark if you have a gray card or you know a white balance card since this is not actually white it's actually like a gray you can use that you could probably pick one up pretty cheap online I know like I have um a screen calibrator I think that came with like a little cube that's got a gray card on it sometimes the inside of like a a camera bag you know has the a good gray on it um or if there's just something gray or silver in in your video clip you could you could use that or something white in your clip but to set the white balance in resolve regardless of the kind of camera you have you want to come into the color tab right here and uh jump on a clip uh let's just pick this clip right here and uh let's say you want to set your white balance so you want to come to these guys right here color wheels your primary color wheels you've got right here white balance so you can click on that and then you would just want to go and click on your your white card there see how it looks so in my case I got my gray sweatshirt here and I've got uh my big softbox that's actually lighting me up right now shining on me if I hit that boom you can see because this is a darker gray it's warming it up a little more so obviously that's not a good white balance um so I'm going to undo that but that's how you would do it and you can you know do it in a specific node so you can go back and change it um if I turn off this node you can see there's there's my color grade a little bit a little bit of the white balance actually I didn't even adjust the white balance in that one it's like I didn't do the white balance in that one it's at zero so yeah so that's what I would do and that's how you would adjust your white balance here in divin g resolve here's a nice little comment 100k when I don't know I was really hoping to get there by the end of the year but I'm not even close with 72,000 73,000 subs so what does that tell me it tells me I need to make better content right I need to make stuff that uh that you guys want to watch I need to do a better job at it um you know some uh some people blow up quick some people just you know continue uh taking it easy there and little by little we continue to grow and it's it's doing awesome and I'm I'm really excited about you know the channel here and everything um but always room for improvement right we can make better content and uh and yeah that's what we're gonna do try and get to 100k I'm really excited I think we're gonna get there and uh I guess 2023 I'm hoping it's gonna be the year that that we get there Gary what's going on mom mom Jason read out my comment what's up Gary yeah he's Gary's always commenting I love you Gary man thanks for uh for dropping a comment on there and uh I'm gonna respond to you here in this comment too I got lots of comments to respond to a little behind been working on some sponsored videos lately and um yeah a little little little behind on some regular content so yeah I gotta get on that all right here's a good one I think we'll uh we'll end on from Dwayne Smithers on my easy audio compression video he says I'm working on I'm working with a client for his TikTok videos he talks loud then soft the cycle continues I would have to bounce from DaVinci Resolve to Nudo Nudo Nudo I don't know that to do all the audio this plugin just saved me from having to do that oh it's actually it's not a question so uh he's talking about the waves MV2 compressor plugin and it's a great plugin man it does a really good job it helps uh you know bring up the quiet parts bring down the loud parts does a really good job with compression for your videos especially if there's big swings in the audio between those louder and quieter parts all right so we're gonna do just one more here since uh that wasn't actually a question so uh let's see photo guy Alan says hey Jason thanks for all your great videos I just put out a new video and tried the dialogue leveler but I found that it would take five there was about a five second delay between when I clicked on a section of my video and when the audio would kick back in when I turned it off everything went back to working normal so I'm gonna continue to use the dynamics for now so yeah that is one thing that I did notice is that the dialogue leveler um I can't remember if the voice isolation is the same I forget but it takes a minute to kind of kick in right a few seconds before it it starts doing its job there so I think that's something that'll get improved uh in the exports that I did I didn't notice any problems maybe it's just I don't know takes for whatever reason it takes a minute when you're playing back for it to kick in and start working but like I said on the exports everything seemed to work out okay um but I'm sure they're gonna continue to refine dialogue leveler the voice isolation uh make it better and better uh you know as we move forward here but um yeah just stay tuned and I'm sure it's gonna it's gonna continue to improve because black matches design that's what they do they just make things better and better for us all right guys that wraps up this DaVinci Resolve episode number four podcast here talked some new tips and tricks there uh that were added
