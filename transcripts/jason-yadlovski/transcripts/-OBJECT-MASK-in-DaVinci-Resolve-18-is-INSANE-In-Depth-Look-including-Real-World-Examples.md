What's happening guys welcome back to another video on the channel today we've got a fun one we're gonna be talking about and that is a new feature here in DaVinci Resolve 18 that is the object mask tool. Now no doubt you've probably already seen a little bit about this from some of our favorite YouTubers out there but as I've been getting into and trying out this tool I thought it'd be interesting to see well how well does this tool actually work. So what I'm gonna do in this video is run over the tool and the buttons and the dials just to show you what it does and quickly explain it but then we're gonna jump in and take some footage where we start with a simple clip like this with the penguin where we try the object mask on the penguin see how it works and then we want to get a little more complicated with our clips because hey when we have things that are isolated and easy like that penguin sure of course it's easy right so I want to try out some other stock footage clips where the track might get a little bit more complicated maybe there's some things in the way and see how that works out. The stock footage I'm going to be using today comes from Artgrid and Artgrid is the sponsor of today's video. Artgrid has so much awesome stuff because let's be honest you can't always get out there to film everything that you need maybe you need some awesome epic drone footage like this right here you can head on over to Artgrid and check it out maybe you're looking for an ambulance scene driving down the street through the city you just search for that there you go there's an ambulance in the city for you maybe you're trying to find a video about somebody playing soccer search for it there it is there's so many cool clips on Artgrid it's crazy and they just keep adding stuff all the time so definitely get on there check out Artgrid if you haven't and you need some stock footage you're trying to sweeten up your project a little bit you want it to look better definitely check out Artgrid I use them all the time love Artgrid. Artgrid thank you so much for sponsoring today's video and if you are interested in signing up for Artgrid I got a link in the description below you can click on that you'll get two months for free you pay for the year you get two months for free so check that out if you're interested in giving Artgrid a try. So not only are we gonna go through and use the stock footage clips but I thought hey you know what okay I expect that they're gonna probably work a little better on those stock footage clips they're shot with awesome cameras you know they they they look great they're cinematic they just really are you know top-notch clips well what if I get out there and I film some clips on my own how's it gonna work on my clips and you're gonna see we're gonna look at a couple examples here of me tearing around on my little four-wheeler it's actually my kid's four-wheeler see how does the object mask work on those clips and I think you might be impressed at how well it actually does so let's jump into it with this penguin clip here get right into the object mask tool so I got my clip here you want to jump over into the color tab right here so click on that alright so in the color tab here let's make sure we are all looking at the exact same thing so come on up to workspace and right here reset UI layout hit that and you should be seeing exactly what I see here as far as layout is concerned on the screen so let's get to our magic mask tool and in this case the object mask where do we go to do that jump it in here real quick I think I forgot to mention that the magic mask tool both for people and for objects is only available in the studio version so if you have the free version you're not gonna see it in there but you probably still want to check out this video because you want to know what can the studio version do I can tell you that it just the studio version just runs better run smoother you got all the tools it's $295 one-time fee you don't have to pay to upgrade right like some of the other you know companies out there no subscription you don't got to pay to upgrade one-time fee you got resolved for the rest of your life come on over to this icon right here we've got magic mask and it's gonna open up on this side of my screen for me and if I want to move this guy over to the middle here I'm gonna click on this little icon right over here in the corner and that's gonna go ahead and just bring this over show me a little more info here so let's take a look at our magic mask window real quickly so up at the top here magic mask obviously that's where we are right here you got these two options you have person and you have object so we're gonna be using the object one for this example you got your reset button right here case you mess something up you can click on this drop down and you can clear your strokes and do a few different things in here if you need to do any of those down in this area here you see a little timeline that goes along with our clip let's take a look at our icons right up here above our little timeline so this first one is go to the reference frame so that's gonna be what frame did you start to draw your line in that says hey this is the object I want to mask the next icon we have here is go to the first frame of the tracked area and it'll do just that go to the first frame of the tracked area the next icon we have here is track backwards one frame at a time next we've got track backwards continuously so wherever your play head is it'll just keep tracking backwards through your clip and track the object that you've selected next we got the pause button pretty self-explanatory the next button the arrows going both ways here is track from your point where your play head is forwards and then track from that same point backwards it's gonna do it all at once for you so that way you don't have to click forwards and then backwards it'll just do it both for you so pretty convenient the next icon here is track forwards continuously so wherever your play head is it'll track forwards continuously until it gets to the end of your clip the next icon we've got here is track forward one frame at a time and the last one here is jump to the end of your track so the last air the last frame of your area that you tracked it's gonna just jump right to that last frame next we've got a eyedropper with a plus icon that's gonna allow you to select your object mask and then we have the eyedropper with a minus icon that's gonna say don't include these areas that I draw over do not include those in the track for a particular object the next button is that you can invert your mask so let's say I select the penguin and then I actually want to select the opposite well you can just go ahead and click invert mask right here next you can toggle on and off your overlay so you can see where your object is selected and I'll show you that in a second here and lastly this just toggles on and off some extra settings that you have here on the side and just taking a quick look at them this just helps refine your mask a little bit you've got quality you can do it faster or better I'm gonna stick with faster now because just a heads up it does take a little bit of power for these tracks to work I'm on a Mac mini M1 16 gigs RAM it's a little slow it takes a little while if I was doing a lot of these I'd probably want a more powerful machine but it does okay job it's not too bad and I'll show you the elapsed times of how long these things take on the screen when we do it and then you've got some other options here on how you can kind of clean up the selection a little bit I'm gonna go over each and every single one of them but if your selection looks a little like you know it could be a little bit better try playing with some of these sliders here and see if you can get it to look a little bit better so that's the overview of the magic mass object selection window here that's like a mouthful there object selection window so now let's get into actually doing this alright first example here we're working with the penguin so how do we do it I want to come and click on my eyedropper with the plus and I'm gonna zoom in I'm just gonna select my penguin now I want to make sure I get the black areas some of the white kind of draw a line like that I'm gonna give it a second zoom back out slide over now how do I know what selected well that's where we can come down here and use this icon right here toggle mask overlay so if I click on that it should show me what is being masked out or what's being selected by the mask so in this case we see my penguin selected cool so now I need to track this forward and back because I know my penguins walking right and like I said this is a pretty simple what I would think simple example for resolve to track this penguin so I'm just gonna hit the track forward button come on at the first frame anyway so I'm gonna go ahead track forward I'll put on the screen here how long that actually takes to do this clip which is not that long couple seconds so here we go alright so we got our object tracked here which is the penguin and this clips only about five seconds long just under yeah it is about five seconds and it took maybe a minute I don't know I'll put the exact time on the bottom of the screen here but let's go ahead and turn on our our toggle here to see where is the mask so if I see a play through it you see that penguin I think that's masked out pretty good I mean it looks pretty good to me so let's say maybe I wanted to you know brighten up the penguin let's turn off our toggle for the mask here so we don't got to see that gonna move to a frame here and let's just say that's just brighten this guy up a little bit and you know you can do whatever maybe it's not brightening up maybe it's something else so if I play through the clip here you can see hey our penguin looks a little bit brighter he stands out a little bit more hey it's not so bad it did a pretty good job of tracking him and then we were able to make an adjustment and it looks pretty good now let's say maybe you wanted to do the background instead you could come over here and click on this invert mask and then that way we're gonna affect the background here maybe if I just reset them maybe I don't know I want the the background to be darker I don't know you want the penguin to stand out I don't you could do whatever you want but you kind of see how this tool works here and then there's our penguin not too bad right all right let's move into the next example we're gonna move a little bit quicker here now that you kind of see basically how this tool works so in this clip here again from art creative we come through you see that bird pop on the screen there so let's go ahead and draw our mask I'm gonna start with this frame in the middle because I want resolve to be able to track the bird as he comes on the screen and then he just stays on the screen but I want to see if resolve can track him as he comes on you got some motion blur going on in there and everything so here's what we're gonna do click on your eyedropper with the plus I'm gonna just draw over top of the bird here I'm just gonna kind of make a little swoop motion here to try and get the different colors of the bird a little onto the orange there and I'm just gonna leave it like that let's toggle on our mask and that actually looks pretty good so now since we're in the middle of this clip I'm actually gonna come down and use this guy right here which is the track forward then track backward so let's go ahead I'm actually fire up a little timer here see how long this takes and yeah we'll go from there alright so our track is done there now that clip again I think is about five seconds and on my clock here it took about a minute to do that so one thing that's gonna help out this particular clip is that the background is not very busy so that makes it easier for resolve to isolate this subject but if I just click through and I got my my mask overlay on here look at this as this bird comes in latest you got the motion blur but the object mask tool is getting all that bird look at that I mean that that's impressive you know the fact that you got the motion blur even look at the tail right up in this area right here you know you can see that it's picking it up it's got some of the red in there does a really good job so let's turn that off maybe I want to you know make them a little bit brighter here I don't know a little bit brighter like that look at that great and if we turn off the the node here there's our difference you can see what's going on there so once you get your object tracked and selected there and it's clean and it looks good you can make any kind of change that you want you know I mean I don't know change change the code of the bird I don't know we want to make them look a little cooler little more orange I don't know whatever you want to do what you want purple bird I don't you can do whatever you want right so in this example it worked good and I wanted to see can resolve tracking object going off the screen and or coming on the screen and in this case it did a good job I think I think it worked out really well now notice I haven't had to change any of these other more advanced settings down here to refine my edge what it's done so far has been okay and and I've been happy with it moving on to the next clip here we have the the buffalo bison it is guy right here now because of the colors in this image here maybe you could use your your you know your keyer here and select the colors of this animal to be able to track it or do something with it but we're gonna use the object mask tool so come on on in here I got my eyedropper with the plus selected I'm gonna go ahead and swipe down his horns there the face the eyeball right on down to his body kind of like that now let's see how well did the selection do by toggling on my mask it does look pretty good let me come down in here I'm gonna add a little bit right there a little right there maybe right there and it looks like a little bit right in there so that's not not too bad there maybe what I even want to do let's see I'm missing his nose which I'm I'm probably okay with that but let's just get some of the darker area there maybe see see how this works so what I'm gonna do also I think is come into the the eyedropper with the minus here and let's see if we can take out some of the the sticks here so they're pretty small but if I zoom in maybe I can just get on there like that a little bit I don't know how well this is gonna work we're gonna try it you know and see what happens here kind of take some of the sticks out so it's saying do not track of those areas all right now let's go ahead and I'm just gonna track forward since I'm at the beginning of the clip track forward and get the timer going let's see how long this guy takes all right so our track is done again about a five-second clip here now this is a little bit more complicated for resolve to figure out and that's why it took about a minute and a half so it just depends on your clip how much stuff is going on in there obviously the cleaner your clip and the less stuff there is around the object you're trying to track the better it's gonna work out for you so if I toggle off my mask and let's just change the color of this guy a little I don't know let's grab mid tones here let's make them I don't know let's make them green purple so you can see it's kind of affecting those those bushes a little bit there the the branches all right maybe maybe not the best you know maybe we'd have to clean it up a little bit here I can try some of these I could try better and see how that does track it again track the consistency change that a little bit you've got a lot of options here on the different things that you can try see how well it works out maybe you can clean it up a little bit clean up the blacks clean up the whites and just kind of see how it does all right so I played with these settings just a little bit I think it cleaned it up a little bit and I just really you know boosted up some colors here with our primary color wheels and stuff just to make this guy pop a little bit more and you notice it's a little bit cleaner there around the branches and stuff so I think that's pretty good if I turn it off let's say you can see there's where we started from I just brightened them up made them a brighter color just so we can see the differences between what's going on with the background and the foreground and the object that we're tracking in this case the guy with the big horns right so as your objects get a little more complicated in the scene when there's more going on it is a little bit harder for resolve to do but it still does a great job I mean I would use this no problem it seems to have done a great job to me what do you guys think comment below how do you think this tool is working out so far but I'm pretty impressed with how well it's able to track the animal in this particular scene there's a lot going on a lot of those little sticks and I think it did a pretty good job now let's move on to our soccer example here so I want to select the grass and I want to make that a little bit greener maybe a little bit darker whatever it might be so I'm going to come on into my eyedropper with the plus and I'm going to select the grass now there's different shades of grass so I'm kind of just gonna draw something like this so hopefully it picks up most of those colors turn on my overlay and that looks pretty good it got a little bit up on the sides there I'm fine with that I'm just gonna leave that so now I'm gonna just go ahead and track it forward and we're gonna see how well it does all right so this clip is done it's about six seconds long took a minute and 40 but look at the track on the grass here if I just play through it I mean it did great it went right around all the people and all I selected was the grass so that that's fantastic I think it did a great job there so if I toggle off my my mask there let's say I want to boost the color a little bit out a little bit of saturation here and maybe make it just a little bit darker you know it's a little bright and look at that that looks great right and if I turn it off see the difference in the grass there looks pretty good we know we darkened it up a little little saturation there I think it does a great job in this situation where we selected in an entire surface it did a great job the object mask tool worked out perfectly so if you like those four clips that we used you definitely want to check out our grid that's where I got those it really makes it helpful when you're working on a project because you can't always go out and film everything yourself but you can use an awesome stock footage service like our grid and I mean I love them hey I use them all the time they help spice up my videos they do a great job I love our grid again thank you our grid for sponsoring today's video now let's jump into some examples that I filmed using my camera because all right it always works out good with stock footage and you know in situations where you've got good high quality video hey my videos are not quality but it's different right you try it at home and you're like this doesn't work come on man so let's get into some of my clips here so this first clip here me just ripping through the woods coming around a corner taking it easy I want to track the four-wheeler and me coming into that scene again we're gonna come to about the middle of the scene here select my I dropper with the plus and I'm gonna select from my head all the way down I'm gonna get the fenders there and kind of under the four-wheeler a little bit kind of like that I want to make sure I kind of try and grab all the colors that are included in the four-wheeler there so you can see once I made the selection here it automatically picks me out now the reason I'm brighter here is because I did make an adjustment to the clip and I actually did it on the same note I should have done it on a new node but you can see here that's what the scene actually looked like and I had brightened up the entire scene just so we could see it like this but let's say I invert that you can see now might me on the four wheeler is darker here so let's just go and track this forward and back and see how well it does so I'm gonna use the track forward and track backward key so let's go hit it alright so our track here is done it's about a six second clip I put on the screen how long it took to do that but if we play through this check it does a great job of tracking me right now I'm all I'm bright because that's you know the settings I had on here but you can see I can make myself brighter and darker here because the track is really good right I mean alright so that doesn't look so good as it gets closer to the screen here I probably want to you know work with some of the things over here to clean it up a little bit and obviously I'm not gonna go that heavy-handed but this is really just to see the example but one thing I think is really great look at this if I zoom in here it tracked it and notice it didn't just put the tree in there it actually tracked around the tree which works out great the program is actually able to see hey here's an object I'm coming behind it let's just take the object that we want to track which is me on the four-wheeler and only track that so impressive I think it does a good job so this first one fairly simple I think works out pretty good alright two more quick examples here of me similar situations here just coming around a corner and I'm curious to see how does it track you know so now I'm a little farther away here let's make a new node grab our plus tracker here I'm gonna select myself here select the ATV home looks good we're gonna see how well does it look looks good I'm gonna track it forward and backwards let's see how well it does in this example alright the track is complete here let's go ahead and turn this on let's play through our clip here now let's zoom in so I mean it does a good job even from far away so let's back up here and just see alright so I can see that it's interacting with some of the elements like the tree now I could just come in here and take that out alright and I might have to redo the track there but if I come back it does a pretty good job it gets the stick in there alright not too bad but you can see a lot of the smaller things here it's not picking up maybe I would want to add in some some strokes over here so that way resolve knows oh hey here's the object and make sure you track it through there but as I start to go back behind this tree here it does a pretty good job of cutting that out so I mean overall I have to say not too bad not too bad I mean it gets more complicated again by adding in more strokes that I want to include as well as using the minus I dropper there and taking out strokes that I do not want to include it's gonna help give resolve a better idea of what I'm looking for in the scene and it's gonna help resolve track it better and I can always change it to the better track mode here too that's gonna make a difference too and I just hit the retract button again there because I did add in that object removal stroke so that I didn't get the tree in there but you can see it does a pretty good job and again when I came around the corner here I could see that it doesn't select the leaves it only selects the ATV and me which which I think I mean that's pretty good you know because you've got some brown in there and tires and whatever but it's not selecting the leaves fantastic I think that does a great job and again we can always adjust it a little bit more and fine tune it with our controls over here you can see if I turn on the mask here look how good a job it's doing there right it's around that grass I mean that's impressive I gotta say that is definitely impressive and as I come and go past this tree notice that tree it doesn't try and mask it out or anything because it's behind this tree it does because it's in front of me in the foreground so overall that track worked out good and I just have one last example here just a little bit different scene some finer material here different colors I was curious on how well it would work out here again coming around a corner a little hot here trying to get it to slide on purpose because I want to know will that mask pick up as the four-wheel swings back and forth and as we've seen so far it does so I'm gonna come in here and I'm just gonna select myself again actually make a new node come in here select myself allow myself to introduce myself and we're gonna go ahead and track this guy forward and backward and I expected to work out well just like it did in the other examples and let's see what we can do here this our track is done here it did a great job look at it how I come through the the leaves here and I've got my mask on look at that as soon as I start to pop through right there we can see it's red let me toggle this on and off so you can see it right look at that I mean that's fantastic it cuts around the leaves and the brush there I mean that's that it that's fantastic I think that does a really great job continues to do it as I come around and now I didn't select I mean everything I just I grabbed the colors I wanted from me on on the four-wheel moving right so I mean it just does a fantastic job here let's turn this off I don't know let me change the colors a little bit here just for something different to look at make me a little more looks like I'm old school there right now let's just play through I mean look at the track does a great job right and that's not having the object tracking mask on now yeah when it gets here okay I could finesse that edge a little bit I could probably use the better setting it does a great job here I mean I gotta say I'm impressed with this object mask tool guys this tool is awesome it does a really good job now it does take some time for resolve to process it takes a lot of power for this effect to work but it does a great job and in the examples that I tried out I've tried out a few more than what we've seen here it does a great job I'm pretty impressed with how well it works so if you've got studio get in there try this out and give it a shot see how it works on some of your clips I want to hear your experiences down below let me know how it works out so a big thank you to art grid for sponsoring today's video love your guys stock footage there is so much good stuff there like I'm serious I wouldn't be here telling you guys about it if I didn't love the products that they offer and the service that they provide with the stock footage because I'm gonna do that to you guys I'm gonna tell you guys stuff that's awesome that I use that I think could be helpful for you guys too alright guys with that said I'm out of here I will catch you guys in the next video peace that you
