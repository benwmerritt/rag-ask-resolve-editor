I'm gonna copy the password I'm gonna come back to the gallery website I'm gonna paste it into the password section here And I'm also gonna put in my own email address at the top here and that's what you would do too Once you do that go ahead and hit enter once you hit enter You're gonna be inside the gallery and you can see all of the photos that I've posted for you to view now When you jump in any of the galleries You're always gonna see this little message pop up here that kind of gives you a little information about how to work around the gallery What some of the different buttons mean so you'll see that read it because it's gonna help you just understand What the different things mean in case you're not sure now if the gallery came from me and it's for a confirmation or a communion or an event I may be watermarking them as you see in these photos right here Because this gallery is free for everybody that attended the event to view and if you want to make any purchases You can purchase either prints or digital files, which I'll show you how to do in a second here But you can scroll through and if you want to make any photo bigger you want to take a look at it Let's just scroll down a little here Say I picked this one right here when you click on it It's gonna go ahead and open it up on the screen You can see the file name sometimes depending on how the photographer sets up the gallery But let's say I wanted to purchase this particular photo You've got some options here on what you can purchase at least from my galleries here So you come on up to buy photo in the top right hand corner right here go and click on that Once you click on buy photo, it's gonna pop up this option with all the different things you can purchase So for example, I've got packages set up where you can buy digital files Some people like to have the digital file instead of having a print that way you can go make prints wherever you want And that's perfectly fine. So you can see in here. I've got five digital files for download 10 20 or 3 Now let's say maybe you don't want any combination of those.

We can pick whatever we want Let's say I like this one once you pick your photo that you want go ahead and hit next and we can do that for all of Our files that we can download.

I forget how long it takes within a week or two. Maybe maybe three weeks It's not that long usually for them to turn it around But maybe they'll tell you there give you a little confirmation code that'll tell you how long the prints might take But the prints will automatically be shipped to you when they're ready So with your digital files This is what the email is gonna look like that you should receive and notice at the bottom It'll say digital downloads will be delivered in a separate email Once they are ready and this is gonna be the email that contains the link where you can click on it and go and download Whatever files that you ordered so you just click right here download photos once you do that It's gonna pop up a little window here and it's gonna have your photos ready to download right here You're gonna go ahead and click on that it's gonna download the photos for you and most of the time It's gonna be in a zip file, so I'll show you how to open that up real quick So the files downloaded it's right here And I'm just gonna go ahead and double click on it and it should unzip everything for you once you unzip it You're gonna see a folder pop up You just go down the folders until you see your actual picture there It is now I've got my picture downloaded or the pictures that you downloaded if it's multiple pictures And you should be good to go you can pull them out of there and drag them and drop them wherever you want to put them on your computer So that's how you would purchase either prints or digital files from a gallery that I might send you now Let's say maybe I sent you a gallery where the digital files are included with your particular package For example the micro sessions that I do for communions You get all those digital files are yours to download and keep if you want prints you can order prints like I just showed you But the downloads for the digital files are gonna be free.

Everybody wants to put some pictures on their phone, right? So let's jump into that. I'm gonna show you how to do that. It's pretty quick and pretty easy So in order to get some of the images on your phone, I got my phone right here I logged into the gallery just as we've already discussed you jump there right through the link in the email on your phone You can get to the gallery and if you want to download a particular image I'm gonna pick this one with the bubble I'm gonna click on it and when I'm looking at the screen here in the top right. We have the little download button I'm gonna go ahead and click on that now already put in my email address But if you didn't it's gonna ask you to put in your email address And then it'll give you some options of where you want to save it You want to save it to my device dropbox or Google photos in this case? I'm gonna say my device so I'm gonna go ahead and click on that and then you're gonna get a message That says a new window with the photo will open press and hold the photo for option to save So go ahead and hit close. It's gonna go ahead download the file It's gonna show it on your phone and now on your phone You just got to push hold and it's gonna give you the option to save photos if you're on a iPhone And if you're on an Android, I'm not sure because I don't have an Android But should say something like save photos or save to device something like that go ahead and click on that And that's all you have to do now that photo is gonna be saved onto your device now You can only save one photo at a time I don't think you can do multiple at a time So if you want a lot of these photos on your device You probably want to download them on your computer first and then send them over to your phone whether it's you know Air drop on a Mac with an iPhone or texted or email it. However, you might want to do it There's a lot of different ways that you could do it But if you got a lot of photos probably download them your computer be quicker than going through and downloading Individual photos on your phone, but if you want a few that's how you can do it on your phone It's pretty easy and it works out pretty good that wraps this one up If you have any questions or you're having any trouble drop a comment down below even if you're not one of my clients I'm happy to help you out here.
