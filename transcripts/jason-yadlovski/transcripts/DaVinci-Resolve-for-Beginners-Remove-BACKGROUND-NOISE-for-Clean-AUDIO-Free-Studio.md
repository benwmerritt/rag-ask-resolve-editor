I've got one chance to get this shot right and I've got a lot of background noise that's going on that might mess up my shot. Have you been there before? Because I sure have. I have to fix this shot because it's the only chance I got to get this shot. I'm going to show you some simple techniques here in DaVinci Resolve, both the free version and the studio version, that are going to help you be able to save your clip so that way you don't have to go out and film it again or in some cases you may not even be able to film it again. So let's do our best to make your clips usable so that you can finish your video. Let's jump in the studio. We're back here in the studio in DaVinci Resolve and I'm going to show you seven different ways that we can remove that background noise. Now this is going to be able to hopefully save your clips so that way you can actually use them and you don't have to go out and re-film or if it was a once in a lifetime opportunity and you only got one shot but you got that background noise hopefully we can make it a little bit better for you. We're going to start with the free version methods and then we'll move into the studio methods. It's important to note that you might need to use a few of these different tips and tricks at the same time to get the best results for your clips and I'll show you an example of that at the end as well as a bonus tip for you on how we can just get everything baked in there so then you don't have to worry about any settings changing or anything like that. So I'll show you that at the end of the video. The first background noise we're going to deal with here is wind. We all struggle with wind and a lot of times it's that low rumbly kind of sound where it's blowing into or past our microphone. So the first clip that I have here is going to simulate wind really well and it's actually a jet engine that's on the back of an Amish buggy at a car show I was at. So take a listen to this. Ah, so cool. So this thing was sick if you saw it in person. It was pretty cool but I'm going to be working in the edit page right here and we're going to be able to access almost everything we need right here in the edit page without even having to jump into Fairlight and that's because of all the great updates here in DaVinci Resolve 20. So if I wanted to use my track level EQ I would come to my track. I would make sure my mixer is open over here so you can make sure your mixer is open and then in your mixer you can actually double click the EQ right here and that's going to bring up your track level EQ. So you can do it here or as a little bonus tip here you could just select your clip and use the new six band EQ right here in the inspector but in this case I want to use the track level EQ and to help take care of some of that wind noise all we're going to do is turn on band one and we're just going to grab this point and you can either grab it right here or right down in here and we're just going to bring it up until it gets rid of some of that wind noise so let's go ahead and give it a listen from the beginning here and we're going to see if we can get rid of some of that wind noise. Ah it's so cool. Ah it's so cool. So you can hear it really takes out a lot of that rumble right let me give you a little before and after here. Ah it's so cool. Now we still hear noise in the background yes but it takes out that rumble that's really distracting like when I'm talking so a lot of that low end wind rumble sound is going to be in your lower end frequencies and by adding what we call a high pass filter right here with our band one by adding that that allows us to kind of take out some of that rumble that's coming through in our clips. Now keep in mind we can always stack up the different things that we're going to go through here but the EQ is a good place to start with some wind noise. Now taking a look at our second clip here where it might be you a talking head and a lot of wind noise in the background let's take a look at this here is what it sounded like without any kind of EQ or any noise reduction. This shot right end I've got a lot of background noise that's going on there so that might be more typical of what you're going to hear. So let's again use our EQ on here we're going to turn on our band one and I'm just going to start at the bottom and kind of slide it up as we're listening to the clip. Now to make it a little bit easier here to loop this over and over again I'm just going to quickly set some in and out points here a little bonus tip for you turn on my loop icon and now it'll play this over and over again as I make adjustments to the EQ. Alright so that does do a good job of taking out some of that lower end kind of boominess sound that we've got in our audio there now does the wind still come through and you can still hear it. Yeah it does but it's a whole lot easier now to understand me talking and I can go ahead and edit the audio now so that I can make my dialogue sound the best that I can. I can use another EQ on top of this to enhance and bring back some of the body of my vocal if I wanted to but just using the EQ here is going to make it a lot more listenable right so that your audience will actually listen to instead of just hearing all this booming wind using the EQ like this is really going to make the clip better for your audience to listen to even though there's some noise in the background that's okay you don't want to completely remove everything because then it might sound a little weird but you want to just make it the best you can for your audience. Now the EQ is in the free version so if you've got the free version this is a great tip for you to use. This next one comes in really handy and it's using the gate or expander so it's kind of like two tips in one here because they're both in the same location so what this is good for is if you have some low noise in your background maybe your noise floor is a little high and the noise floor is just basically that that kind of underlying tone where if you're not talking there's kind of like you know maybe it's a fan in the background maybe it's your computer fans maybe it's uh I don't know an air conditioner or something like that the expander and the gate can really help kind of bring down that noise floor a little bit in between the parts where you're not talking so let's take a look at that. Here's a sample of me in my studio and it's going to have some background noise listen to this. Sometimes dealing with a little background noise can be a bit of a pain in this case I've got a fan running on the other side of my wall over here I've got dehumidifiers running down in my basement if I'm quiet for a second. Okay so you can hear that noise just going in the background it's fans so let's use our expander and I'll also show you the gate and how they work so this is in the free version and you can jump into Fairlight if you want or just access it right here in the edit page again in our mixer we want to come to our dynamics I'm going to go ahead and click that open and in our dynamics panel here we've got our expander and our gate so all we have to do is turn it on now let me give you an idea of what the expander and gator are doing so the expander is just going to make everything below a certain db level quieter quicker and you can drop it down in varying amounts now a gate is going to work exactly like it sounds it's a gate it says okay this gate is closed you can't hear anything until we hit a certain db level then that gate's going to open up and it's going to let the sound come through so a lot of times I'm going to use the expander versus using the gate so let's try that first so I'm going to turn on my expander and right now everything is at the default settings and to get a good idea of where I want these settings to be I'm going to actually come to this part right here in my clip where there's the noise and I'm going to loop that section set an endpoint and an out point using that loop tip we talked about so now I can loop that over and over again while I take a look in our dynamics panel so with my expander the threshold is where does that expander start so where does it start to make everything quieter quicker so we're going to adjust that as we listen to the playback here but then we can also affect the ratio so this will make it get quieter faster you can also adjust your range here if you want and kind of see what the range is doing here if you want to reset any of these just double click them in and reset it for you so let's play through this and make some adjustments so we can see on our meter right here that we're actually reducing those lower sounds below say 40 dB by 10 dB so we're making a 10 dB quieter so here's a little before and after and you can drop it down as much as you'd like you can even bring up the threshold if you want it to really drop it down but once I start talking then it's going to kind of interfere a little bit so you got to kind of balance it out here so if I reset all these let me turn on the gate and you can see the gate drops down a whole lot quicker so I can change my range so that as soon as it hits that threshold that I set which in this case is minus 33 dB it drops down the audio really quick but that might not work the best when I start talking so I'm going to clear my in and out points by using option or alt x and let's listen you can kind of hear that in the background so I'm going to show you how we can take care of some of that minor background so you can see it's kind of getting a little choppy there so we wouldn't want to use the gate this much maybe if you were going to use a gate you would drop it down a little bit maybe like this you can kind of hear that in the background so I'm going to show you how we can take care of some of that and even still it's a little choppy where we would get into adjusting our attack our hold in our release as well as maybe adjusting our threshold a little bit but in most cases I like to use the expander because it's just a little bit softer of a of a tool to use here but either way can work and a lot of times a bonus tip here extra bonus tip is when I'm using a gate I might use it on something like a microphone where if I have a podcast and the person speaking into the microphone I don't want their microphone to pick up the other person right so I could put a gate on the microphone of say me talking so when I stop talking it's not picking anything up right so we can hear the other person talking in their microphone now you're gonna have to balance it out to make sure that you're not chopping off you know the person who's actually supposed to speak into that microphone but the expander in the gate are great tools to get started here they're in the free version you can apply them and they'll do a really good job of helping your noise floor and the background noise that appears in between your words your phrases and where maybe you're not talking in your video and you don't have to make it gone you don't have to turn that noise all the way off you just want to reduce it a little bit so those are two tools that I use all the time mostly the expander all the time and they do a great job this next one here is an effect that's built into the free version as well as studio and I gotta be honest it's not one of my favorite tools to use but I think it's important that you know that it's there because there are times where it will work good or maybe you want to use it in combination with something else and that is the built-in noise reduction tool so we can apply this one here in the edit page really easily we can open our effects library we can come down to audio effects scroll down to noise reduction right here and we can click hold and drag this onto a clip if we want to use it only on one clip or if we drop it over here it will add it to the track similar to adding it through the mixer in fairlight so you can do it either way I'm showing you the way to do it in the edit page here just in case you don't want to jump over into fairlight so I'll drop it on my track and then once it's on my track in my mixer here in the edit page you'll see your effects light up right here and we'll see our noise reduction tool right here so the first thing I'd recommend that you do everything's reset here this is the default settings I'm just going to click auto speech mode we're just going to see how it does here so we'll make a little room on our screen again I'm going to set my in and out points here just so we can loop it and let's hear a little before and then we'll turn it on when we get to the second clip here we got lots of birds going on in the background a little tack of the birds can't seem they're over there somewhere but I don't know a little bit of wind noise there too and a dog so there it is with the noise reduction on and off again I don't think it works great in most cases and maybe this isn't the best use case for it but I want you to know that it's there now you can also tell this tool to learn the background noise and then apply it so if I were to just come to my last little section here click on the manual and learn play through the clip it should learn what it's hearing and then I'll stop it you know at the end here and see what it does okay I did that little bit and let's play through see how it did we have lots of birds going on in the background a little tack of the birds can't seem they're over there somewhere but I don't know a little bit of wind noise there too and a dog so it helped a little bit it definitely didn't get rid of that wind noise I'd probably want to use a little bit of the EQ on there like we talked about in that first tip so this tool does work okay sometimes but most of the time I'm not going to use it I just find for me it doesn't get the effect and the desired result of removing the background noise or whatever noise it is that I have in my clip so it's there try it out sometimes it'll work but for me I don't use it too much but it's good to know that it's there this next way to remove background noise utilizes a little bit of AI here in DaVinci Resolve this is available in the free version as well as studio so it doesn't matter which one you got you can do this so we're going to take a look at the same clip where I was in my studio we had that little bit of low background noise and that's where the AI dialogue leveler is going to do its best work if you have a lot of background noise it's probably not going to be able to remove enough of it but if you've got a little bit of background noise like this it's going to work out great so I'm going to apply it onto my track you can put it on a track or a clip either way is fine I'm going to select my track just over in this area here make sure your inspector is open audio section and right here we have dialogue leveler so I'm going to go ahead and turn that on now you can adjust your settings right here or if you want to see the actual window click on this little icon it's going to pop out the window for us so let me just play through this little section right here so you can hear what that sounds like with it turned off my basement if I'm quiet for a second okay so that's what it sounds like originally now we're going to go ahead and turn on the dialogue leveler and we've got some different options here you can allow for wider dynamics optimize moderate levels more lift for low levels and lift soft whispery sources so I'm just going to leave it on allow wider dynamics and then we've got these three options here you'll notice we have background reduction right here and that's what's going to help take care of some of that low level background noise now you don't have an adjustment on this so you're just going to turn it on or turn it off and the AI is going to do the work for you to make a slight adjustment it's not going to be a huge adjustment but listen in here's how it sounds a dehumidifier is running down my basement if I'm quiet for a second you can so you can see how it kind of reduced that background noise a little bit now it did undulate a little bit right so it just depends you might need to apply to just the clip and use the inspector to turn it on for just that clip or you might want to apply it on the whole track and it's going to be dependent on your clip as far as how well does this work is the AI able to hear that background noise remove not remove it but at least make it quieter or are you going to have to use a different method to get the best results if you have the free version of DaVinci Resolve those are going to be the main methods that you can try to help reduce or remove that background noise you can use third-party effects if you want to VST effects they can get installed into Resolve with no problems I use some of them all the time but now we're going to jump into the studio features that help remove that background noise and honestly they do a fantastic job like the one tool that I'll show you which you've probably heard of before is just probably the best tool that you have to remove or reduce background noise but the first one we're going to talk about here is the AI dialogue separator and when it comes to some wind noise and background noise that I just want to bring down a little bit so I can hear any vocals that might be happening so in this clip right here I'm up at Niagara Falls riding one of the boats up into the falls here and here's what it sounds like so we've got a lot of noise we've got wind noise we've got water noise we can hear announcements being done over you know whatever the PA system so let's try and clean this up a little bit and the dialogue separator is going to do a good job for us so this is applied on a track level you do need studio to do it so I'm going to select my track in this area here make sure your inspector is open you're in the audio tab and we have dialogue separator so I'm going to go ahead and turn that on again we can work with it right here or click on this and pop out the little window for us but what I'm going to want to do is work with my background and ambience and this is going to just help kind of balance everything out so I can actually hear the voice that's speaking a little bit better right in this case it was announcements but it could have been myself speaking so let's go ahead and just loop this set some in and out points we got our loop and let's play through it and we'll make some adjustments so you see there we were able to reduce the background a little bit right we don't want to take it out because then it doesn't seem like it fits the scene and we're also able to bring up the voice a little bit now you can continue to balance this out the ambience in this case doesn't seem to do too much but you want to play with your background and your ambience and that's going to help you balance things out a little bit and then you can also boost your voice a little bit to make the voice in the clip sound a little bit clearer be a little bit louder and just come through a little bit clearer for your audience as is an ai tool so if your computer is a little bit older mind's a little bit older it may lag a little bit it may take some time to kind of you know figure it out catch up do the processing in the background but the dialogue separator here can do a really great job of separating things out and even if you wanted to remove the voice you could do that there's a lot of people out there that want to keep the background noise but remove the voice this is a tool that you can use to do that and I'll just show you that real quickly here so I'm going to reset the background and ambience and I'm going to drop down the voice or you could click mute voice right here so there you go it takes out that announcer's voice you can kind of slightly hear it in there if you knew it was there and you're actually listening to it but that's one of those tools there that a lot of people want actually they want to remove the voice but keep the ambient noise or the background noise of nature or you know a waterfall whatever it might be so dialogue separator really great ai tool here in the studio version and last but not least at all my favorite and the one reason that you should get studio if none other that is voice isolation it is just so good since they brought it out it keeps getting better and better with the updates to DaVinci resolve here and it can reduce or in any case remove almost all the background noise from your videos and just keep the voice it's an ai tool here it's only in studio but it does phenomenal job so check it out i'm in york city walking down to the javits center to the build conference by b&h last summer it's noisy here's what it sounds like guys heading back to the javits center for more action at the dlb build whatever b&h conference there's been awesome at some great creators heading back over there now and a lot of background noise those trucks are loud especially the dump trucks in the brakes there now voice isolation it's usually my go-to tool for any noise reduction because i have studio in my opinion it does a better job than all the other tools in almost all cases because you can adjust the amount you don't need to use a full 100 of it but in this case let's turn it on and see how it does in this clip so i'm going to apply it on a track level select my track come to my inspector here and i'm going to turn on voice isolation now in general you do not need 100 it's going to make it sound a little too weird but it will remove all that background noise for you so i'm going to start with it at zero slowly bring it up as we play through the clip here and see how it does now let's loop this guy that is like a great tip you got to loop your clips it just makes your life a little easier so i'm going to press i and come to the end press o play through our clip and here we go guys heading back to the javits center for more action at the bld build whatever b&h conference there it's been awesome it's some great creators heading back over there now and um you know we're going to watch jarrett poll in here at four o'clock so we'll see you then so you can see right there it did a good job if we cranked it all the way up it does remove most of that background noise you would have some problems sometimes with real high screechy noises kind of like was on those brakes on those trucks right so that's something you might need to be a little bit careful of but it does do a good job of just taking all that background noise and making it a little bit quieter right because the city's loud and we can use voice isolation on any one of our other clips and it's going to do an awesome job so i would recommend if you have studio go to voice isolation first because generally that's going to do the best job and you can adjust your amount a lot of times i'll just use between 10 and 20 percent of voice isolation in order to reduce that background noise a little bit and just make it not so harsh so if you want your audio to sound the best you got to get studio you got to use that voice isolation because honestly it's awesome it's probably the best noise reduction that i've seen and it's built right into resolve so you might also get studio get all the other benefits of resolve studio and have voice isolation there for your audio work so let's just bring all these tips together here and i want to show you how i applied various amounts of these tips onto the original clip in the beginning of my video here that you saw to help kind of take care of some of the wind noise and just make it sound a little bit better so to be able to see it a little bit easier and a little bit clearer let's jump over into fairlight musical notes at the bottom so on my track number three here let me just play a little bit of it for you and then i'm going to show you the couple things that i did to make it sound better some simple techniques here in DaVinci resolve both the free version and the studio okay so sounds a lot cleaner right so what did i do here well if we take a look at my mixer i can see all of the things that i applied to this clip the first thing i did was add a little bit of eq to kind of sculpt the way it sounds i did use my high pass filter here my band one to get rid of that lower end rumble from the wind some simple techniques here in daVinci resolve here free version so eq was the first thing i went with i did go with a little bit of an expander here right you can see if i turn it on and off you can see it's actually working in the background there as i play through the clip and the studio version that are going to help you be able to save your clip so you can see that it's active there because our meter's lighting up now i did take a little bit more heavy-handed of an approach here just so that you guys can hear it i could back all this stuff off a little bit and just you know make some of that noise come through so it doesn't sound like i'm you know in a vacuum space but i wanted to be clear that these different tools in combination can do a great job so let's close our dynamics there i also used a little bit of voice isolation if i open this up you could see i did around 20 percent let's say maybe i even want to back that down a little bit say 15 percent here's how that sounds so that way you don't have to go out and film it again or in some cases you may not even be able to film it so you can adjust that however much you want again like i said i went a little extra heavy-handed here so that you can hear the difference and then i decided to add another EQ effect which is new in Resolve 20 here where i could put the EQ in as an effect because i wanted to bring back some of the the body to the vocal a little bit because as we use the EQ on the track we took out the wind noise but it made the vocal or dialogue sound a little bit thin so i tried to bring back a little bit of it here with my EQ with another EQ and here's what it sounds like a little before and after some simple techniques here in DaVinci Resolve both the free version and the studio version that are going to help you be able to save your clip so that way you don't have to go out and film it again or in some cases you may not even be able to film it again so let's do our best to make your clips usable so can you hear how by adding that EQ on top of what we already did it kind of brought back some of the warmth in the body to that dialogue now i'd probably continue to work with a little bit i might add in like a multi-band compressor something like that to really just kind of fine-tune the dialogue itself a little bit better now that our background noises is lowered or removed like i said one little heavy handed here i'd probably do a little less in the real world here but you get the idea of how all these things can work together and you don't have to use a hundred percent of them use a little here a little there and just find what'll work best for your particular clip now for this bonus bonus tip here it's something you probably didn't even know that you could do and that is to bounce a track in place and what that's going to do is just bake everything in there for you so that way you don't have to worry about accidentally changing anything once you've got it exactly where you like your audio so this has to be done in fairlight just so you let you know so we need to select our track we also need to set an in and out range here in fairlight then we want to come up to timeline down to audio and bounce selected tracks in place and once we go ahead and do that we're going to see it's going to bounce the clips in the track and they're actually on layers so you didn't lose anything just in case you're getting a little worried there and it's actually going to show us the updated waveform of what it looks like with those effects applied and let's play through and give it a listen i'm going to show you some simple techniques here in DaVinci Resolve okay now we can always take it and move it down to a different track if we want and there's our original clips right underneath and you see what the original audio looked like right here in the waveforms and down here we see what the waveform looks like reflective of all the changes that we made to it both the free version and the studio version that are going to help you so now if you needed to just raise it up a little bit you can see it's a lot more consistent than our original clips be able to save your clip so that way you don't have so that comes in real handy especially if you want to see your waveforms and the changes that are being made to it by the different effects and the eq and the dynamics and things that we've done to it so i hope you're going to be able to take these tips bring them back to your video and make those clips usable make those videos usable that you filmed that might have a little too much background noise in it if you have questions on any of these tools feel free to drop me a comment down below with that said i'll see you in the next video oh by the way you might want to check out this video over here check that one out it's a good one trust me i made it it's a good one see you in the next one peace
