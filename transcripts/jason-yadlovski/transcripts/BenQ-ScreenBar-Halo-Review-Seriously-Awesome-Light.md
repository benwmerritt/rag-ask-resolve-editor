They're gonna give away one of these lights to one of you guys There's a link in the description below so check that out enter the contest cuz if you guys win this light I'm telling you you're gonna like it. It's an awesome light I've been using the other one for a long time and I'm really looking forward to trying out this one with this new feature That it's got which I'll talk about in a second here and one other quick thing The contest is only open to us and Canada residents. So if you guys aren't in the USA or Canada I'm sorry that they're not gonna be able to ship it anywhere else But us in Canada hit the link up in the description below sign up so that you can be in the running to win this guy Cuz I'm telling you dude these things are awesome. You're gonna want to get in the running to win it All right with that said let's talk about what comes in the box You saw a little b-roll there in the beginning so we have the screen bar light itself now This is a new light here or relatively new newer than the other one We took a look at and the big difference is right here on the back of the screen bar here It has another light built in so if you're like me, I'm in my studio here. It's always dark I have a normal light hanging on the ceiling behind the camera there and I gotta pull the chain turn it on all that But a lot of times like I just don't want that light on right But I need a little light back there cuz all my gear is back there Well, this light is gonna light up behind my monitor right I usually have my monitor here And I mean I think that's gonna come in super handy and even if you have your computer up against a wall or something You just want a little soft light. That's what this is gonna do for you on the back here The other really cool feature about this set is that the dial here to operate the light is actually wireless, right? There's no wires on here. They do give you three which is triple-a batteries here that you put in this guy and We're gonna go over some of the features of this But that's how this light works Whereas the other one that we took a look at a while back it had a cord to it, right? It was attached to your monitor via USB a USB cord came to this well now it's wireless So that's pretty sweet. I like that and I I mean I from looking at the instructions. There's no syncing things up I think you just turn it on and it's good to go We're gonna find out because we're gonna put it together here in a second The other thing that is included with this light is this little guy now it might not look like much But what this is for is if you want to use it on a curved monitor like this guy this guy right here It's I forget what this is 36 38. I forget it's big It's wide and it does have a slight curve to it I have been using my other screen bar on this monitor without any problems it works out just fine and I doesn't spill onto the screen at all but this little guy right here is actually gonna allow you to properly mount it up to a curved screen and Prevent any glare from going on to the screen You also get this little pad here because you may need to Put this on here and push it out a little bit depending on your curved screen and how much it curves and all that kind of stuff Depending on your setup you may need this which is just gonna help make you adjustments And you might need this guy if you have a curved monitor if you don't have a curved monitor You probably don't need these two parts, but it's nice that they include them for you And then of course you get nice little thing here with your instructions and your warranty and service stuff So always check out the instructions there if you don't know how to use it definitely check out instructions I always tell everybody check out the instructions for everything you might learn a little something all right So that is what comes in the box here now. Let's get into setting this guy up What's nice is that it just plugs into the USB ports on your monitor assuming you have some now You are gonna need a USB port so if you don't have one on the monitor thankfully on this monitor I've got several and I think most monitors you probably do right But if you don't you can just plug this into any other kind of USB power supply So I know that I'm gonna need this little this little clippy guy right here. So we're gonna take that and Where that goes is right underneath the front here So under the front this little clippy guy is gonna go there and we're just gonna put it right on top of the monitor here And there we go it's installed right so I'm just gonna plug it into the back of the monitor Then we're gonna dump the batteries into here see how this bad boy works So on the back of this guy you're just gonna open this up right here Boom and that's where your batteries go right in the back right there So one thing to note that if you have your screen bar on your monitor when you plug it in the USB needs to be at least a 5 volt USB now on the back of my monitor here It does say that it's 5 volts, but the light is gonna flash when it doesn't have enough power Let me show you what that looks like real quick So you can see here it's flashing and that means that it's not getting enough power to run the light now I don't know why the 5 volt on my monitor here isn't given this thing enough power But I do have a USB strip and when I plug it into there it works just fine So for now I'm gonna plug it into that USB strip and that's gonna solve our problem here of it flashing on and off So if you see it flashing that means you need a USB port that's got more power to it So I plugged it into my USB power strip and now you can see the light is on it's constant and it's getting enough power So I know I just said that my monitor has a 5 amp USB plug on it And it should run this light but I was having some issues and it was blinking just like you just saw However, I just turned on my computer all the way You know I went to go log in and when it was all the way fired up Then the light was working just fine when I plugged it into the back of the monitor So as long as you got that 5 amp USB plug the light should work out fine. It's working out fine for me now So a little bit of user error there before that was my bad. So all right back to the video All right, so let's talk about this cool remote here So this thing's really cool in order for it to work and turn on the light You kind of have to hold your hand over it for a second here kind of like using the force and then that's gonna turn this guy on right here So you hold your hand over and then I can hit the power button, which is right in the middle here That's gonna turn it on and off and like the other light we've seen from Ben Q here You've got different color temperatures. You've got an auto mode So if I hit the auto mode here, it's gonna auto adjust and it's gonna set the brightness for us based on your environment So that's kind of cool. You can just set it on auto and you're good to go now Let's say I wanted to change the color temperature myself. I can come over here I can click on the temperature button and I can just rotate this around and you can see it's gonna get more towards the yellow side of white balance or Turn it the other way and it does have Dials on here and gauges right you can see as I'm turning It's kind of giving you a gauge of where you're going and if I wanted to change the brightness I click on the little brightness guy here and I can make it bright or make it not so bright Here's as bright as it goes right there Let's say I want the the white light. There's yellow. I don't like the yellow want the white light Even that that's a little more blue than you know the rest of the lights I got going on here Well, we can balance it out a little bit and on the little remote here They have a favorites button so you can set the light to be whatever your favorite settings are So you might want you know a whiter light and you want it to be a certain brightness You can get you can program it the way you want hit that favorites button and then boom It's gonna jump to that anytime you hit that favorites button and to turn the light off You just hit the power button in the middle and then it's gonna go ahead and shut the light off now Sometimes this might turn off because it doesn't need to be on all the time right? So if it does turn off you just got to hold your hand over it's got a little sensor It's gonna know you're there and then you go ahead hit the buttons and adjust it as you need So that's how the front part works right and now we got a light on the back So there is another button over right here on the bottom It's a little hard to see but there's a button there and when you hit that it's gonna change the mode So you can use the front light the light on the back or both lights So let me slide this monitor over here see if I can show you what this looks like alright So over here. We're looking at the front light if I hit the mode button once it's gonna turn off the front light and Back here. It's gonna turn on the back light. I got the cord stretched out a little bit there So it's gonna have the back light on which is kind of nice I mean it's gonna light up behind your monitor and actually it's pretty bright It's in my eyeballs coming back on this side Let's hit the mode button again and now we've got on both the front light and We've got on the back light so you've got both lights on and they can really light up your workspace good So it's cool. You can do front light you can do back light you can do both Rotating through the modes here pretty sweet. You can do your lights however you'd like to have them lit up So one of the really cool things about this light is that both the front and the back They both do the same color temperature and the same brightness So if I come on here and I want to change the color temperature You can notice it's gonna change the front to yellow as well as the back So that's pretty sweet that you know, it works hand-in-hand. They both are the same So you don't have one that yellow one that's white, you know, we mess with your eyes and all that kind of stuff So it's nice that they work together They also work together with the brightness as well as the auto setting so pretty sweet You can set it up however you want and they're gonna match from the front to the back So let's just touch once again on why these lights are so good And the best part is that you can sit here at your monitor Let me pull this guy down The light is gonna come down here and it's not gonna hit me in the eyes The light's gonna come straight down and not get on the screen, right? It's gonna light up your desk area without Blinding in the eyes blasting in the face. You don't have to have big soft boxes on and stuff like that It's just gonna light up your work area So if you like to work in an area where it's a little dim like I do or maybe if you're just even in roomware You need a little more light, but you don't want something, you know Blasting in the eyes or you don't want to put a lamp on your desk This thing is great. It can just sit right on top and it does a great job of lighting up your work area I've been using one of these for a long time and it works great. It really does I think I knew you guys would be excited to have one of these guys as part of your setup So wrapping this all up. What do I think of this light? They're awesome Like I said, I've been using it for a while the other version and I'm excited to have this one because it's got that light on the back Which I think for me is gonna come in handy in my situation So if you need the light on the back, this might be the light for you If you don't need the light, you could always try one of the other ones too. Either way, I think you can't go wrong The other thing that I really like is that the little hockey puck here is wireless That's kind of nice. I mean, yeah, you got to change some batteries once in a while But I imagine they last pretty long, you know, especially if you're just turning it on and turning it off And you're not adjusting it too much I know for me I find the setting I like and I kind of leave it there all in all it does a great job of Keeping my eyes from having to strain at the screen like if I leave this soft box on up here, you know You kind of got a squint sometimes it's just it could get uncomfortable, right? So it does a great job of just giving me the light that I need Without, you know getting in my eyes and just you know being too bright and just kind of being annoying kind of like this soft Box would be if I wasn't filming so for me this light is awesome And I think you guys would like it too so you should head down to the description and sign up for that contest We're gonna be running it for two weeks.
