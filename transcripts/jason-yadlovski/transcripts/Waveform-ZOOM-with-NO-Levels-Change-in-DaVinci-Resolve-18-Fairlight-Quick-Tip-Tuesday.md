It's true, you can zoom in on your waveform to find those problem areas in your audio. Let's jump into Fairlight, I'm gonna show you this cool little trick. In DaVinci Resolve here, we can make our waveforms bigger, right, by grabbing our gain line and boosting it up. But what if our levels are set good and they're kind of down like this, but we know there's a problem, we just can't find it, we need to see the waveform a little bit bigger. Well, if you hold your Option and Command key on a Mac, or your Alt and Control key on a PC, move your middle mouse wheel, it's gonna zoom those waveforms up or down based on the way you're scrolling your mouse wheel. So let's say I know there's a problem right here, I want to make them bigger so I can come up here, zoom in just a little bit, and now I can see that problem nice and tall versus when it was down like this. Now it's not changing the volume, this is just zooming in on the waveform, so don't get confused by it. If you do use this tip, just use it to find your problem area. Say I boost it up like this, let's say my problem area is right here, I'm gonna add a couple keyframes by holding Alt and clicking on my gain line, add in the keyframes, drop this down a little bit. Okay, let's say that looks good. You want to make sure after you zoom in on that waveform, you go through and you reset the waveform size. In order to do that, make sure your clip selected, come on up to the View menu, down to Zoom Audio Waveform and you want to do Reset. And you can also make it bigger and smaller right here, as well as assign a keyboard shortcut if you really want to. Let me go ahead and hit Reset and boom, there we go, we are back to our normal size waveforms for this particular clip based on however we adjusted our levels. So really handy, you can jump in there, make those waveforms bigger, find those problem areas and then make sure you reset that waveform zoom just so you're not confused and think that you boosted up your levels or reduced your levels when you really didn't. Guys, that's Quick Tip Tuesday. Thank you so much for tuning in. Lot more Fairlight tips coming up here in the next couple of weeks, in the next couple months as long as I can keep bringing you guys tips, I'm going to be bringing you tips. So Quick Tip Tuesday in the books, guys. I will see you in the next video. Peace.
