It is Quick Tip Tuesday and today I've got a tip for you. If you like to record voiceovers into DaVinci Resolve, we got a great quick tip for you. Let's just jump to resolve, check this out. So I'm in the Fairlight tab here. I've already recorded my voiceover, but when you look at the file right here, you can see it says VO Inspire. Now I've already bounced it, which is why it says bounce and a bunch of numbers after it, but how do I get my recording to actually have a name that makes sense instead of a bunch of random numbers or letters? Really easy. When you create your track for your voiceover, just give your track a name and whatever name you give to your track, that's what name the file is gonna have when you record your audio. So if you look real quick here in my folder that I am saving all of my recordings to, you can see it's called VO Inspire. And then I've bounced a few, which is why there's a couple different ones here, but VO Inspire. And if we look back in Resolve here, the name of my track, VO Inspire, the name of my clip, VO Inspire. And this helps you keep track really easy of all the different files when you're recording multiple things into the eventually resolve. Just name the track whatever you want the file to be named and boom, when you hit record, that file that you create as you're recording your voiceover will have the same name as the track. So this is just one of those little quality of life things when you're recording voiceovers, helps make it easy to keep track of everything, easy to find things when you need to look around a bunch of audio files that you recorded and you're like, I didn't know what I'm looking for. Name your track and then your recorded file will have the same name as the track. If you wanna know where this voiceover came from, it's one of those little inspirational videos that I made. Got a couple of other videos talking about the whole thing. You can check them out if you're interested and if you wanna take your audio to that next level, check out my course Audio Essentials for video editors in DaVinci Resolve. One stop shop for everything you need to know about working with dialogue, music, sound effects, put it together, make it a little mini documentary. It's pretty cool. It was a fun project and a great class for you guys to learn all about audio. So a link in the description below. Check it out if you're interested in that. With that said guys, I will see you in the next video. Peace.
