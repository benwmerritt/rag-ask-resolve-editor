## Transcript
What is happening guys welcome back to the DaVinci Resolve podcast. I know I know it's been a while since I made a podcast and I gotta be honest I just haven't gotten to it. I've got so much to do so much going on but I want to try and put some more effort into this and I've got tons of questions to answer and comments on my YouTube videos here so I figured you know what let's hit record there let's get another DaVinci Resolve podcast out there and let's help some more people. So big news this last week DaVinci Resolve 19 is officially released I know a lot of people have been asking about that for quite some time it's officially out now back up your database and then go ahead and go and download DaVinci Resolve 19. Tons of great stuff in there and there's even new stuff between the beta 6 version and the official full release that we have now. I know I'll be talking about some of that stuff in upcoming videos kind of going over some of the things that are a little less known maybe not as you know popular out there obviously we have a lot of great audio updates and things but there are some things that are just kind of you know tucked in there black magic of science like I'm gonna just throw that in there do a solid for you guys and there's a lot of that kind of stuff so I'm gonna talk about some of that stuff in an upcoming video but for the podcast here let's just go through some comments here answer some questions gonna help you guys out the best that I can and yeah let's just roll right into this so the first question here or comment I should say is on a video how to save text in Resolve 16 which obviously we're at 19 now they say the option is now shifted to the media pool option by clicking the three dots you'll find this all right cool thanks man next up we have a little bit of a question somebody asking for some advice here and they say Jason this was thorough and easy to easy to follow while watching this video was DaVinci Resolve 19 audio in one year only and had a fix that however since I went to 19 yesterday after the release the production release all my tools change as if it defaulted my tears say go back my faith says go forward now the problem I don't have audio attributes or audio clip attributes nor clip attributes in my menus could you help me find them figure configure or something I'm using a Mac that I that I I normally put all my footage on a local hard drive but this project is pulled from my NAS so one of the things that you could check is just look if it's in a different spot when you right click on any clip so if I just jump in Resolve here if I right click on any clip we see clip attributes down here you should see it there's no reason you shouldn't there's no option to turn you know this menu on and off there's no reason you shouldn't see it I'm in the edit tab right here I can't remember on 186 if it was somewhere else or not but you should be able to just click clip attributes and it should be right there no reason that it shouldn't be there so I don't know why you might not see it maybe you want to I don't know download and reinstall it or something you might want to do that so you could look into that a little bit next comment here on audio sync fixes so thankful just give you guys a little heart there let's see creating a sound library everything I need or every time I need something I come here thanks Jay as always you got it little heart and a thumbs up to you some of these I've already answered here so let's see we got a comment on no sound fixed here says hi it sounds good I followed your steps but still running into the same issue no sound and I said hi no sound still and they said I changed the cash cash cash browse and now it's working so I guess maybe the cash location maybe they cleaned out the cash there that's something that you could try out and see if that works there so good glad they got that fixed up time code so as you may or may not know a lot of projects they start by default at like one hour and I've got a video on how to make it start at zero right and some guy says or some person says whoever came up with this hour things an idiot well I don't know about that but I think it's from you know old film days or whatever next comment on the audio x-ray vision and DaVinci resolve hi Jason wonder if you do any one-on-one coaching I mean I'm happy to help people out I haven't done like official like hey you pay me one-on-one coaching because most of time I can answer your question you know in a few minutes and and you're off and running so so I'll just reply to them I'm happy to help out if I can how to install third-party transitions here in DaVinci resolve they said Jason how about video clips I just subscribed to in Vado and downloaded some video clips but I can't seem to install it in DaVinci resolve I'm using a Mac so if it's a video clip it should just be drag and drop you should just be able to drag and drop it in there is what I'm thinking so yeah you probably want to look into that I don't know what kind of file you downloaded if it's something else maybe it's not supported for some reason if you're using the free version I know there's some limitations on the files that are supported if you're in studio it supports a whole lot more file formats so that's one thing to keep in mind but if you downloaded it from Envato you should be good to go I don't think there should be any issue with that so I don't know drag and drop is what I'm going to go with for that one comment on why your DaVinci resolve 17 voiceover is not working now the commenter says another reason why it's not recording a waveform could be that the capture location in project settings isn't set correctly I had the same problem yeah you want to make sure when you're recording voiceovers that you set where you want those recordings to go so that way you can find them and they'll be all linked up and all that kind of stuff so you want to make sure you do that in your project settings for playback and capture set your capture location and then you should be good to go once you make your recording here's a comment from a post I made about resolve con I went live I said I'm going live in five minutes that was last week and I was just getting ready put a little picture up there and they said hey jayson you mentioned mastering the final mix at the end of your presentation do you have any videos on that topic now I know I talk about that as part of other videos I don't know if I actually have one that specifically talks about that at the end of the process so mastering at the very end of your audio editing process to me would include maybe a little bit of sweetening a little bit eq sweetening and maybe you know checking your loudness making sure you're good there and that's pretty much it maybe you want to throw on a little bit of a compressor if you need it just to make sure but uh yeah I'll have to make a video on that so I don't think I have a specific video on just that but I'm going to make a video on it for sure so sometimes in resolve it has saving issues where it doesn't want to save or you're not able to save so I've got a video on a little quick tip that works for me to save that and somebody commented on there didn't work for them but now I know how to open two projects at the same time at least I wish I could have them in different windows though yeah it would be helpful to be able to kind of separate them out and have you know one over here one over there but uh at least we can have two opens swap back and forth copy and paste between projects um you would just right click in your project manager and then choose turn on a dynamic project switching and then you would have uh have everything good to go there so uh let's see next a question we have here or comment is jason I need your help maybe you know the answer maybe you have a contact at black magic that can answer this resolve 18.5 working on a project today at work and finally started reaching the finish line as I was working through the eq of my audio 30 minutes into sound design the handy frequency analyzer displays for spectrum and waterfall options somehow disappeared I didn't see the playback audio overlay more in the plugin uh I could have continued without it but I love that feature to the recent version of resolve so I began to search the internet for hours counting uh and my evening continuing into my evening but found nothing I watched hours of youtube content red blogs hours was found nothing and then on resolve 19 so I went home upset revisited my research I gave up researching then proceeded to download resolve on my personal computer to confirm I wasn't going insane to my surprise I saw an updated version of resolve 19 I pulled a clip from my hard drive opened up fairly jumped into the q boom the waterfall displays were there after I saw that I dove back in a black magic's course on audio to potentially discover if they would go over the new feature but the video was not the latest version of rob now I continue to spend more time looking to search for an answer is there a way to toggle back toggle the playback waterfall displays in the eq if so how can I enable it on my work computer I don't think it was in there in 18.6 but you said you were using it so uh maybe there was I thought that was a 19 feature but let's see if I just jump into fairlight here open up my eq um three little dots no I don't know that there's a way to turn that on and off that I know of um fairlight view I don't I don't think you can turn that on and off the waterfall thing oh wait uh nope that's the waveform zoom I'm looking for the um frequency analyzer but I don't think there's a way to turn that on and off at least not that I know if it's always just kind of there um let's see if I just let's go to my music track here because I know that'll play all the way through yeah I don't know I don't know you can turn that on and off you got me stumped on that one I think it should just always be there so I don't know what's up with that sorry I can't help you out more on that one I would try to reinstall maybe that's the only thing I can think of all right comment on my video normalize audio levels versus side dynamics normalizing and dynamics are not the same thing says watching you work in hearing the subtle changes you make as you go is like watching a colorist go through their grade and seeing incremental changes to the image this is elite stuff man thanks appreciate that on sidechain video thank you very much uh let's see fixing your audio bus one you got to make sure bus one is working yep check that commenting because this gave me the power of a thousand editors the ability to save sub clips yep saving sub clips you could just make a clip in your timeline click hold drag bring it back into uh the media pool there boom you got a sub clip good to go uh let's see exporting vertical videos and tips in resolve 18 when I send this vertical video to somewhere it gets distorted uh that's gotta be the export settings or something um that would be my guess so I would say check the export settings because I think something might be up with that so a quick comment on how to color grade iPhone footage would there be any possible way to figure out the color profile on the iPhone because I don't own a mac and windows does not seem to give me the details I'm looking for if anyone could help be greatly appreciated I think Darren's got a great video on this if you check out Darren Mawston's channel he's got a good video on grading iPhone footage and stuff I believe it's uh if you either use the rec 2100 or oh what's the other one let me go to resolve here and take a quick look um let me just jump in here let's go to some footage here I'm going to right click color input space uh yeah the rec 2100 uh one of those might work or the rec 2020 I think uh those might work for apple if you're using apple log um there is an apple log color space here you can right click on your clip choose apple log that should do it for you uh I think one of those options should work but definitely check out Darren's video because he's a color master so he would be able to tell you better than I could comment on three tips to move background uh remove uh audio noise background noise best way to do it is going to be voice isolation and if no other reason to buy studio voice isolation that's where it's at you want to buy that uh studio version so that you can get voice isolation because it's just a fantastic job of taking care of all that and uh you can even just reduce the background noise a little bit you'll have to take it out so voice isolation is great for that comment on a unique transition hacks into venture resolve 19 so the comment is I have studio 19 I've tried doing what you said about applying transitions between clips the double clicking doesn't work at all when I drag and drop sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't even when it works I don't get that little symbol indicating that there's a transition that has been applied like I see when you do it what am I doing wrong okay so first thing is if the transition goes on and you're not seeing it you could just be zoomed out too far you got to zoom into your timeline more because the transitions are generally uh you know fairly short with I don't know 24 frames 12 frames whatever it is so you got to zoom in to see them so that could be one reason why you're not seeing it um the issue with not being able to put it on there that could be that you need to shorten up the clips on either side because if you're at the very end or the very beginning of a clip you're not going to be able to drop a transition on there there needs to be a little bit of a like a a little bit of the clip underneath where your cut is so uh you want to try that shorten up the clips even only a couple frames that's really you know all you need and then it should work you should be able to drop them on there all right comment on split screens for multiple clips in resolve can you still add images and text that haven't or have that that have something in whatever form as well yeah you should still be able to add clips in a split screen setup if you want yeah you could put anything there as long as you can get in resolve and see it you can use it in a split screen all right here's a good comment slash a question on a video how to fix muddy boomy dialogue they uh they said i have to ask this because i'm screwing the whole thing up and nothing online is answering my questions is all the audio relative when it comes to the eq or are the eq numbers standard why can't i just pick the sounds best on the first clip then select all the clips and make the eq match or is it once i've edited the clip if i save and close and go back the eq will appear as a straight line again and any changes i make from there further uh that the clips of the current baseline i can't see how anyone can edit a two hour video with hundreds of clips one clip at a time cost effectively i can't seem to select all under edit on the fly nothing intuitive works so frustrated so here's a couple things to think about one is i would edit on a track level right separated out your dialogue your audio by different you know microphones different locations different actors so you'll probably have a few tracks of dialogue when it comes to eq don't work on a clip level is my advice work on a track level and that's why we want to separate out our dialogue into sections that make sense that are in the same location or the same person so we can edit that whole section with the eq that's in the mixer in fairlight we don't have to go one by one you don't have to copy clip to clip or do any that kind of stuff you do it in the mixer in the inspector of fairlight that way it applies to the entire track so if you're going clip by clip yeah no that's going to take too long although you can do it once on one clip and then copy it and paste attributes to all the other clips if you wanted to but i think it just makes more sense to work on a track level in fairlight using the mixer over there same with the dynamics and any effects that kind of stuff so um so that's how i would do that you know you should be able to use the track level eq not the clip level eq and and hopefully that should help you out there here's a good one on an easy logo transition where i have a divinter resolve wipe they say it doesn't work if i drag the logo in the inspector panel it closes so what you need to do is make sure the resolve logo is up like in your viewer right so if it's in your media pool double click it make sure your logo is seen and you're not looking at the timeline viewer so then click the logo drag it over and drop it in the inspector and then it should work all right here's a comment on how to color grade iphone footage isn't uh isn't work on windows can't load the footage and resolve i think he doesn't like mov's any idea uh my idea is that if you're on the free version there are file formats that aren't supported it's just a limitation of the free version if you had studio and it's not working then i'm a little more worried about it uh but studio probably would allow you to bring that in and drop it in so i'm thinking it's a free versus studio thing so that's my thoughts on that one all right here's a great question about the new ducking feature in resolve 19 they said can you patch a bus with multiple voice tracks to send to one track so that way you can use the source for the ducker uh that's a work around to duck multiple tracks and you can't actually do that using the ducker tool right i know exactly what he's talking about we've say we've got one two three dialogue tracks we send it to a bus so they're all in one spot then we want to use that bus for the ducker to look at and say oh let me dunk you know duck say my music underneath so ideally yeah i don't know why that's not an option where you can use a bus but unfortunately right now we can't so the way around that is to uh use the i'm going to call it a little bit of an old school way but we want to use the sidechain in the dynamics panel so you can send all of your your dialogues a one two three dialogues over to the bus and then in the dynamics panel we can use that bus as a source to essentially do the ducking so it's like an extra step or two you've got a little more control over it than using the new ducking feature that's in the mixer uh you got to know a little bit more about how to use it and it's going to you know do a better job to use a bus versus the regular ducker in the inspector can't use a bus so i don't know why that is like why not just let it use a bus right why not i don't know but i just tried it yesterday and it didn't seem to work um so i don't know hopefully they'll put out a little update where we can do that in the ducker because that would be nice and easy so yeah for now can't use the ducker to work with a bus all right let's wrap it up with one more here uh it's a comment on a timeline view options video but it doesn't seem like it has to do with that but here's what it says they say uh hi i had a video that rendered fine size wise for youtube made changes to render for tiktok now i want to render a section of the same timeline for youtube but the video is now tiny i'm sure to some time and want to revert to the revert the video size i've tried to restore default uh davinci default settings no joy how do i restore the settings i had for youtube or is there a way for me to import the timeline into a project where the timeline window seems to fill the screen so i would just duplicate the timeline and then adjust your timeline settings right so if you duplicate your timeline you adjust it or right click on the timeline and then choose timeline and then timeline settings you could change it back to be whatever resolution you want i'm assuming you went to a vertical format maybe a lower resolution or something like that i would just change it back and you should be good to go um a lot of times if you're going to make changes like that to do you know one thing for tiktok or whatever um i would just duplicate the timeline when you're done you know make a new timeline and if you actually don't want to have to like make changes if you adjust your original just create a new timeline and then put the other timeline inside of your new timeline and then you can make adjustments there um and you know use it that way so that way if you make any changes it'll automatically get updated for your other you know tiktok or other vertical video whatever it might be so um yeah i would just go back and do the settings now if you were wanted to do it this way you could also have your full video in your timeline and then just change render settings right and you can save a couple uh renders a couple jobs to a couple jobs in the queue so that way if you want to re-render the youtube one boom hit that do that if you want to do a tiktok one set it up so you've got your vertical resolution as well as your you know other settings that you want and then boom render that out so that way you're always working in the same timeline but you're just changing the um uh the render settings and then you can render it for whatever type of um you know format that you want and just be working on one timeline so that is how i would do that that wraps up this episode of the DaVinci Resolve podcast guys thank you for tuning in i hope this was helpful answering a few questions here for you i gotta do this more often because it's fun i enjoy it and i think it's helpful
