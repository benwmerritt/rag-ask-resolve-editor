Have you ever run into this problem before where your images just don't have the right color when you bring it into Venture Resolve? Maybe even your video clips don't have the right color, but you're working to color-managed workflow and you're like what's going on here? Why does this color look so off? Sometimes I get images that look like this And that's not right, let me show you how to fix it. It's quick and easy check it out So I'm here in the Venture Resolve and I've got logos I use all the time here in a power bin For example the YouTube logo it looks pink. What's going on with that? Or I've got the DaVinci Resolve logo and the color is just too saturated, right? What's going on with that? Well, I work in a color-managed workflow for my Canon C100 Mark II in log footage And what happens is by default all these images are being Treated as if they were in part of that color space, which they're actually not. They should be SRGB So if I come in here and I just control or command A to select all of them And you can do this with your video clips in your particular project in any bin as well I'm gonna right-click come down to color space and I'm gonna change this for these images to be SRGB so when I click on this watch our DaVinci Resolve logo boom now our logo looks good if we check our YouTube logo Okay, that is YouTube red there we go Just so you can see the difference here if I right-click on the YouTube logo and I change the input color space back to the project Which I use as Canon Cinema Gamut and Canon Log Now we get our incorrect color for our YouTube logo So I'm gonna come back right-click input color space back to SRGB Drop it in my timeline the YouTube logo or any other image that you might have or video clip is gonna look good here in your timeline So keep that in mind when you're working in a color-managed workflow if something doesn't look right as far as the color of an image Or maybe your footage or you've got footage from different types of cameras Make sure you change the input color space for that particular image or clip so that way it works out good when you drop it in your timeline Things don't look a little out of whack as always if you guys have any questions about this or anything else in DaVinci Resolve Drop a comment down below I do my best to get back to you all and even if I don't get back to you in the comments I may include your question on an episode of the DaVinci Resolve podcast So be on the lookout for that as well.
