In this video, I'm going to show you how to create a cool audio visualizer that reacts to music or audio that looks like this. It could look like this if you want, or you can change it up, fill it in, make it look like this, and even create something that looks like this. My name is Jason Yulowski. I'm a DaVinci Resolve Audio Guy. Let's jump in Resolve and check it out. For the first method here, we're going to be creating this completely in DaVinci Resolve without any extra tools and things that we do need for the second version. So we're going to be using Fusion to do this. Now, the thing that you need to know before we get started is that the audio file that you need to use in order to make this work needs to be a MIDI file. So how do you create a MIDI file? Pretty easily. Let me show you what I did right here. I took my talking head clip that I used in the beginning of this video and I exported out just this portion of the clip, right? I don't need all of my audio from the entire clip that I filmed. I just want this part. So I exported out just this and there are some free resources that will automatically convert a file from anything to a MIDI file for you. So one of those I'll leave a link in the description below. I found it online. It looks like this and all you have to do is drag and drop a file in here and it will automatically convert it to a MIDI file for you. So in this case, the file that I created, I just made a MP4 file, right? So just rendered out a video file and I can just use that and drag and drop it right here. And then this website is automatically going to analyze it and it will allow me to download a MIDI file. So I can come down here and download the MIDI. Now you can use an entire video if you wanted to. It doesn't matter if you want to do the whole thing, you can drop it in. But really what you want is just the section of audio that you want this visualizer to react to. So that's pretty important, right? Get your audio set in DaVinci Resolve with just the section that you want for this visualizer to react to. So download that file, put it on your hard drive wherever you want and make sure you know where it is. So when we get to the point of needing it, you know where to find it. So I'm going to jump back into DaVinci Resolve here and now what we need to do is actually create this thing in Fusion. So I'm going to keep this clip in my timeline because we're going to need that as well. But what I want to do is add a Fusion clip to my timeline. So I'm going to come to my effects library. We're going to come to our effects and you want to grab your Fusion composition, drop it on top of your clip. Now in this case, I'm going to stretch out my Fusion clip as long as my audio clip is here because the audio file that I drop in is going to match up with this audio file. That's part of this video clip because that's what I use to create it. Next step we want to jump into the Fusion page on our Fusion composition. So in Fusion here, the first thing we want to do is add in two background nodes. It's all right if they're merged together, that's perfectly fine. Now since the green background node here is our foreground color, I'm going to select whatever color I want that waveform to look like or to be. So I'm just going to pick a YouTube red because it's easy. And now I'm going to connect my merge one here to my media output and I should see it up here on the screen. So the next thing I need to do is create the little bar that we want to see that's going to animate. So on my background node number two, I'm going to add in a rectangle shape. And once I do that, it creates a little mask on there and I can select the rectangle, open up my inspector here and I can adjust it to whatever shape I want. So I'm going to make it, I don't know, you may be like this. I think thickness looks pretty good. I'm going to round out the corners there because I like that. You can change the height and the width to whatever you want it to be. I'm also going to drag it over to this side of the screen a little bit. So now we've got one of these on the screen, but we want a couple of them so that way they can kind of, you know, move and react to the audio that we're going to be using. So in order to do that, I'm going to select my background to node and I'm going to add a duplicate node. So I'm going to hold shift and hit space bar. That's going to bring up this and I'm just going to search for duplicate right here. And we've got duplicate. We can go ahead and add that in. Now, once we've got the duplicate node in there, I'm going to select the duplicate node, come up to my tools here and you can select however many get. You can select however many copies you might want. Let's say I want to do maybe 10. I'm going to select 10 copies and then we can also adjust the center of these so that it kind of spreads them out a little bit and you can adjust them however you like them to look. So I'm going to say right about there looks pretty good. Now, the next thing we're going to do is add in the audio file. So this thing knows what to react to. So to do that, I'm going to come over to the rectangle tool and in the rectangle node here in the inspector, I want to come down to the width and height. Section here and just right click in there and you're going to get a bunch of options. We want to come down to modify with and we want to come down to MIDI extractor. And this is why you need a MIDI file. Once we do that, we have the option to come over to modifiers up in here and you'll see under controls, we can add a MIDI file right here. So you want to go ahead and select that file that you made as a MIDI file. You stuck it on your hard drive and your project directory or wherever you put it and select browse and go find that file. So I added in my file. The next thing you want to do is come down to combine events and we want to change this to some. So now if I were to go ahead and play through my Fusion clip here, you can see our lines are reacting to that audio, but they're not reacting too much, right? We want to make some changes so that it's a little more, a little more animated and looks a little bit better, right? So in the duplicate node here, we can come up and we can adjust our copies if we want it to be longer. And time offset here is what's going to give it that different kind of height and reaction look to the audio. So originally it's at zero, but you can bring it all the way up. You can even punch in a number higher than you if you want. You can say 50, you can say whatever you want and just adjust it to get whatever look that you want for your particular little spectrum analyzer there. So I decided to go with more copies. So I went with 20 copies. I did an offset time of 18 and I think that's going to be pretty good for where I'm going to leave it for this video, but you adjust it however you like it to look. So now we jump back into the edit tab here. And if I wanted to see what's going on underneath this, right? Because right now the whole screen is black. I can't see anything, but we made that one background node black so that we could do this. If I select my Fusion clip, open up my inspector. I can come to my composite mode and change that to add. And now that's going to appear on top of the video. Now you can try other blend modes if you like, but the add one takes out all of the black. And the other one that takes out the black in the background there is screen. If you want to use that, you can click on that. So now I can even scale this down if I want, right? I can make it smaller on the screen. So let's do that. I'm going to bring it down a little bit. And now I'm just going to let the render cache build up here for this Fusion clip so that it'll play back nice and smooth to make sure that that's working. You want to go to playback, render cache and make sure you've got smart or user selected right here. So once it's all rendered up, here's what it looks like. In this video, I'm going to show you exactly how to create this cool audio spectrum. So if you don't like the way it looks, just go back into Fusion, modify some of the things in the duplicate node there a little bit and you can get it to look however you want. So that's how you can create it right into Vittor resolve without any extra tools or anything extra. You just need to convert any of your audio files into a MIDI file. And another quick tip here is if you've done this and you want to make sure that you don't move your audio out of sync with your Fusion clip, just select all your clips here, right click and choose link clips. So that way they're all connected in the timeline and you don't accidentally push one out of whack. For the second method that we have here, you're going to need to use a tool called the reactor. Now this is a free download. It's got tons of all kinds of really cool stuff that you can use in the standalone Fusion version as well as in DaVinci Resolve's Fusion. So I left the link in the description below. You can click on that. It's going to jump you over to this website where you can download the reactor for free. So you just scroll down the website, come down to right here, reactor installer and download this file. Now once you've got that file downloaded, you want to jump into the Fusion tab and you want to take that file and just drag and drop it into the area where you usually put all of your nodes right here and then release. And that's going to say install and launch. So you can go ahead and install it and launch. And you may need to restart DaVinci Resolve in order to make sure that everything gets booted up in there. So do that. Install this and then restart DaVinci Resolve. Once you've got resolve restarted, come back to Fusion and we're going to want to come up to workspace. Come on down to scripts, reactor and open reactor. This is where you're going to see all of the tools that you can load up in DaVinci Resolve. And we're going to want to scroll down and look for this one, audio waveform. So go ahead and make sure that's checked. Click on the install button right down here. And then that should be installed and you should be ready to go. After you do that, you can go ahead and close this window. Now you may need to restart DaVinci Resolve here if you don't see it in the next step. So keep that in mind. Maybe just give resolve a restart. Let me make sure everything's loaded up and then you can move on into this next step. So jumping back into the edit tab here, what I want to do is add a Fusion composition into my timeline. So I'm going to come to my effects library. I'm going to come to effects, Fusion composition, drag and drop that down into my timeline. Now the next important thing to know is that for the audio file that you want to use, whether it's dialogue, you know, yourself talking, or whether it's a music track, it needs to be in a wave format. So keep that in mind. You can go to a free online converter, just, you know, Google convert to wave file. And there's tons of free converters out there. You could even just export out a wave file from DaVinci Resolve if you needed to. If you need to know how to do that, drop comment down below. I can make a video about that, but you need to have a wave file. So keep that in mind. So now let's jump over into Fusion. So now that we're here in Fusion, I want to add in a node. I'm going to hit shift space bar. And the node I want to add in is called audio wave form. So type in a you spell audio, you're going to see it right here. So I'm going to go ahead and add that in. So now I'm going to just connect that up to my media out. And in this audio wave form node here, you're going to see we've got a lot of options and things we can tweak and play with over here and make it look however we want. First thing you need to do come over to the wave file, hit browse. Go find that wave file that you want to use. And now once my files loaded up and I start to play through my timeline, you're going to see that wave form up in here in my viewer reacting to that music. Now we've got lots of options and cool things that we can play with here to change the way that this looks. You can change the zoom factor of it. You can change the resolution of it. You want it to look a little bit better. One thing that's really cool right in the main controls tab right here is that you can have it react to only certain frequencies. So if you only wanted to react to bass, hit the 20 to 300 hertz there, and now it's only going to be reacting to the bass. You want to do midrange, high range, you can do whatever you want. So I'm going to go ahead and turn that off because I want it to react to everything right now. But we can also come into our layout tab right here. We can change the thickness of this line. We can change the color. Let's say I want to make it a green line here. If I play through it, you can see it may take a moment to render up and just kind of get playing a little bit better there. But it'll start to react to the music track or the audio that you put in there. Now you're not going to hear the audio here in the Fusion page, so that might get a little tricky. But I'm going to show you what we can do about that in a minute. And we can also come into the spectrum part right here. We can change the way that this looks. You can make adjustments of all kinds of different things down over here. You can make it bars. You can change it to smooth filled in, smoother waveform. You got tons of different things that you can do on here. So lots of options here for you to choose from. You can go into all these different tools here. Just change it to look however you want it to look. And real quick, how I came up with the options you saw in the beginning of this video. In the spectrum section here, I did change the FFT. You can make that bigger and it's going to add more points on your line here. You can also adjust the K, the log K here, as well as the smooth factor. You can adjust the scale if it's going off your screen. I did use the smooth option as one of them. And if you click on this right here, equidistant cuts, and then we change it to bars right here, it's going to give you this look right here, which I used in the beginning of this video. And you can adjust the scale factor here by cranking this up or down, make it look however you want. Now, if you don't want as many bars here, you can just select the FFT here and change it. And it's going to change the amount of bars that you're going to see, or the amount of points you might see if you use something like smooth or needles. I use this one as well. And to make this look a little bit better, if you've got something like needles, you can come back to layout and just make the thickness a little bit narrower. And you can see you start to be able to see all of those different lines in there, come back to spectrum. And again, however you change this, it's just going to change the look of it. You just adjust it to whatever you like. So by selecting different options that we have here under appearance, and then adjusting the smooth factor along with the FFT, jumping back into the layout and the thickness, that's how I got those different looks for the audio visualizer in the beginning of this video. You just play around with it and make it whatever you like, but really easy to use. So let's say I like it like this, let's jump back into the edit tab. Now it's important that when you're creating this that you know what audio file that you're using, and you want to bring that into your timeline. So I've got it here in my media pool. It's called travel with me. I want to drag and drop that in the timeline. Now what I can do is extend out this fusion clip as long as my audio clip is, because the entire fusion clip is going to react to the entire audio clip that I used as the reference file when we loaded it up there in fusion. So now I'm just going to lower the volume of this down so we don't blow our ears out here. But I can play through it and that's going to react to the music. And again, you can change it to look however you want to make it less extreme and all that kind of stuff. That's up to you on how you want to do that. Now if you were to make a cut, for example, if I was to make a cut in the middle here, and I deleted this part, well the fusion clip is going to continue. So if I took a piece of the audio out and pushed this together like this, it's not going to match up anymore because that fusion clip automatically looks at the whole song straight through from beginning to end. So if you have to make any cuts or anything like that, you'd want to do that first. Get all your audio work set up and done first. And then once you export out the wave file, you can bring that into fusion and that's what you would use. So you want to make sure you cut up all of your audio and do all that properly first. So I'm just going to undo all my cuts there. Now what I would recommend is that you select both of these and we can link these together so that they don't move around differently in the timeline. So if you select them both, you can right click and say link clips, and now they're linked together so that way I don't accidentally push things out of whack, and then they don't line up and it doesn't make sense, especially if it's with dialogue. If you wanted to add something underneath this, I could just bump these up a track. And let's say I've got some talking head I wanted to put under here, right, like this. You can see I drop it in there and it looks great. I can see right through the black disappears there. I can see the waveform on the screen. I could even come in here in the fusion composition and scale it down if I wanted to or move it around. I can also adjust it right in the fusion tab if I wanted to. And if I just play through it, here's what that kind of looks like. Right, now keep in mind it's reacting to the music, not to my dialogue, right, like it was in the beginning of our video there. So you can do it either way. Any kind of audio it works for, it just needs to be a wave file to use this second method here. So there you go, two ways you can create a audio visualizer here in DaVinci Resolve, either with no other extra special tools or using the reactor. If you want to know how you can animate an image to the beat of the music using the reactor, it's got another video up over here you can check that out. It's going to show you exactly how to do it. And if you install the reactor for this video, you're already halfway there. So check out that video if you want to know how to animate an image or video or something like that, versus just having a waveform on the screen. If you have any questions, be sure to leave a comment down below. And with that said, I will see you in the next video. Bye!
