Yo, what's happening guys, we're back. It's time for a proper quick tip Tuesday It's been a little while right since we had a quick tip Tuesday But I got a question the last week or so that I thought might be helpful to everybody else out there And that is if you apply an audio effect onto one clip or a couple of clips in your timeline How do you go back and edit that effect that one? We're in fair light It's easy to pop open that effect in your mixer. No problem. You can edit it But what if it's just on a single clip? That's what we're gonna talk about today Let's jump into resolve quick tip Tuesday. Let's go So I am in the edit tab right here and let's say I just want to apply an audio effect to a clip But not an entire track. So I'm gonna come on over to my effects and open that up Make sure I'm on audio effects right here and let's say in this case I want to use a multi band compressor. We're gonna click drag and drop it onto my clip now The first time you drop it on you're gonna get that window where you can adjust all your settings and everything's right there Super easy. So you make a couple changes. You make it the way you want. Okay. I'm happy with that I go ahead and close the window now. Let's say, ah, maybe I want to make some changes after listening to it Right, how do I do that? Well, you don't have to jump into fair light You can do it right here in the edit tab So you want to select your clip then come on up to the inspector right here You want to make sure you're on effects right here and now you see we've got a lot of options It's basically all the things we can change in the effect right here, but I know what you're thinking You're like, I don't want to edit like this. This looks like It is too much work. Let's be honest. I don't want to look at it like that How do I get the window back so I can just make adjustments visually right so you can click on this little icon right here and That's gonna reopen the effect window for you Where you can go through and make any kind of adjustments that you want and this works for any audio effect here in DaVinci Resolve If you want to apply it to just a clip and not the entire track But if you do want to apply an effect to an entire track you do that over in the fairlight page in the mixer Whoo, another quick tip Tuesday in the books here guys was that helpful? Let me know. Hey, what do you think about this angle? I just happened to set my camera over here and I was like, hey, that looks kind of cool Something a little different right if you're missing some quick tip Tuesday check out some more videos right up over here All right, I'll see you in the next one. Peace
