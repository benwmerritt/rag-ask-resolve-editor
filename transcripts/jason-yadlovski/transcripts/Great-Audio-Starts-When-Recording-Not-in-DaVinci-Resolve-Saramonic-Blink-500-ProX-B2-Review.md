When it comes to making videos, audio is super important because if your video sounds like garbage, nobody's going to want to watch it. And I'd like to help you guys try and get the best audio that you can through programs like DaVinci Resolve, getting in there and working with your audio. But when we're talking about audio, you have to start with something that is good. So today we are talking about this guy, which is going to help you get a good high quality audio recording right from the start of your video. Talking about this guy, the Saramonic Blink 500 Pro X B2. This is a microphone that Saramonic sent out to me to try out and share with you guys. But what I'm actually going to do is work on a project that's not a DaVinci Resolve project, but it's a house project. I got to take care of something upstairs. We got some new windows and I got to put on this plastic mat and a garden window. You know, so if you order the plants, they, you know, it doesn't get wet and ruin the window. But for the entire length of this video, you're going to be hearing the raw audio straight out of the camera recorded with this microphone. Now just a quick couple tidbits about this microphone setup. This is the B2 version of this particular microphone. And what that means is it comes with two TX units, which is the lav mic that I'm wearing, and one RX unit, which is on the camera, which if I pull it right on over, there it is right there. So you get two of those in this particular kit. And this kid will run you about 250 bucks, $259 when I just looked it up a minute ago. So it's not cheap, but it's going to give you some great quality audio. And Saramonic does offer some really cool, unique features with this microphone kit. But we'll talk about more of what comes with it and the different parts and pieces and how it works, you know, as we get into our project upstairs. And Saramonic did send it out to me to try out for free and to review and share with you guys, but I'm not paid for my review. I'm just giving you my honest opinion and what I really think about this. So with that said, we're going to jump into our project and you're going to hear the audio from this microphone for the entire length of the video. Again, I'll edit it at the end. You can hear what, what it would sound like if I edit the audio for this particular microphone. And with that said, let's just jump right into the project. We've got some things to get done. Let's go. So check it out. We got this garden window here and it just has a wood base here. So what I want to do is actually put a piece of plastic here and just make it so that if we put plants and things up here, that the water doesn't seat down and ruin this window because this guy's pretty nice, but it does have wood all around the outside. And I don't want that to get ruined because that's just part of the window. So that's what we're going to be working on. All right. So what we're going to use to put on the window there is this stuff right here. It's called polywall. It's kind of like a thin little plastic material that I think is going to do a good job in protecting the surface there for us. So the plan of attack is to measure that guy out over there, measure out the window. Then we're going to come over here, draw it on here, cut it out, pop it on there, use a little bit of silicone dabs, maybe just to hold it in place because I don't want to actually glue it to that piece of wood since it's actually part of the window. But I think that should work out pretty good. So we're going to see how that goes. And just a reminder, all the audio that you're hearing in this video is the lab mic here from Saramonic. And one of the cool things is that it actually comes with two lav mics in the pack. So we've got one receiver up on the camera right now, and then I'm wearing one lav mic. And if you had another person in the video, there's a second lav mic, and it actually records one mic to your right channel and one mic to your left channel. And then when you bring it into post and dementia resolve, you just make your track a mono track, and it should work out all pretty good. So, oh, by the way, that's another project I got going on over there, building some built-in book shapes, book shapes, book shapes, book shapes, book shelves around the fireplace. So my pops has helped me out with that one little project we got going on. So always tons of projects, man, tons of projects between YouTube, home, all kinds of stuff, always kinds of projects. So let's get into measuring out the window over there and get going. All right, next step in the process, we're going to measure out our 33 by 22 on here, get a rough cut out there, nice square, and then we'll kind of fine tune it and be a little more exact with our measurements. So let's do that. Next, got to have big old straight edge, right? We've got the old big four foot level here. That's what we're going to use our straight edge, drawing our lines, and then we'll see what we've got to do about cutting this guy up. Do I go exacto knife or do I go scissors? Hmm, I might have to try a sample there. We'll see. All right, lines drawn, let's cut this guy up. All right, there we go. First cut done. Now let's go measure it out, mark up the rest, and then make a few more cuts. I think I might use a razor to do the rest of the cuts, just because I think it'll be a little bit easier, a little straight edge and call it a day there. So we're going to measure this out and go make some more cuts. So let's do it. Before we go measure out for this next cut here that we're going to do, one cool thing I really like about this microphone is it comes with this guy, this case right here, which is actually a battery charger, right? So the little microphones, if I open this guy up here, there's one of them right in there. It doesn't have a, I mean, it's got battery in it, but it's not a changeable battery where you can swap it out. It just charges right in this case. So you recharge this case up, it's got a little USB three on the back there, charge it up. And then when you're done with your devices here or done recording, you stick them in here and it's going to charge it up for them automatically. So that's pretty sweet. I mean, I like A, it comes with a case that makes everything easy to carry and B, it charges it up for you. I mean, that's pretty sweet. I like that. And you got one RX in here, which is on the camera now, then you got two of the senders, the TX devices. So obviously one's right in here and I'm using the other one right now, but that's really sweet. I like that. And it's even got some little lights on the front here that you can push it and it'll tell you, you know, the charge level of the box itself and stuff like that. So pretty cool. I like that. And really convenient to have this guy to be able to pack your stuff up in. So you don't have to just throw it in the bag. Who wants to do that? You want to throw it in the bag. All right, over to measuring. All right. So I think the best bet here is to just measure it out. I'm just going to draw it on the back of this guy right here. And then, then we'll know where we got to make cuts and stuff like that. So I don't know. Front side, back side. I don't think it matters. So let's get to measuring here. You know, I got to take lots of breaks throughout the day too. Come say hi to the pup. Oh, hey, Jim, Jim. Oh, let's get you in here. All right there, kid. What do you think, Jim, Jim? Say hello to the people. All right. Have a seat, girlfriend. We're nursing an injured leg here. We got a little injury when we're out playing the other day outside. So nursing a little hurt pack leg there for a pup. For a pup. But she'll be all right. She'll be all right. All right. Okay. Let me give her some cuddles, some love. And then we're going to get back to that project. Oh, dude, that's my ear. That's my ear. Come on. Come on. This dog just loves cuddles, loves or cuddles, huh? Can you get your butt out of my face? Should we get back to work or what? No, more belly rubs. Loves belly rubs, this guy. There you go. Let's go. Let's go. All right, there we go. Bam, bam. How's that look? All right, let's see if it fits. Pop it in. Hopefully it fits. All right. Some final tweaks. And this guy looks pretty good. We've got a good fit in there. Nice around the edges. Draw a line under here and cut that. We'll be good to go. All right. Final test fit. Here we go. It's looking pretty good. Pretty good. So final test fit. Here we go. All right. Not too bad. Not too bad. So we'll just like put a little piece of trim or a little caulk around the edges in there, but otherwise works pretty good. Comes right out to the edge there. And I think I'm happy with that. So another fun little fact about these microphones is that you can use this guy just like this. It has a built-in microphone on the top here. So you can just use this as it is. You don't even need the lav mic part, although you're going to get better audio if you use the part that, you know, you can put on somebody, the actual lav mic part, but you can use just this, clip it on here if you want, and that can work pretty good too. So these have a range of 100 meters, which is pretty far. I haven't tested it out that far yet. That's pretty far. Maybe I'll jump outside real quick, walk away from the camera. You can see how far it does go in my yard back here. But overall, I mean, these things are really good. I've been happy with them. And, you know, I've tried a lot of these little type of microphones and a lot of them, they're not so great. Okay. I just kind of put it like that. There's a lot of, you know, negatives or cons to using them. But this set right here actually does a really good job. And I think Saramonic knocked it out of the park with these little guys. They do a fantastic job. So real quick distance test here. I'm outside my yard, wide angle lens. So it looks by far than it is. It's probably, I don't know, 200 feet, maybe, maybe, maybe not even that far, maybe 150 feet. So I'm going to drop the camera down, go run down there and let's see if you can still hear me. You should be able to. So here we go. All right. I don't know if you can see me all the way down here. Here I am down by the pine trees, walking back. I do make sure that the receiver's on my belt loop and it's kind of out in the open. It's not tucked under closed. So that's as far as I can get here. And like I said, it's probably 150 feet, 200 feet, something like that. So it's not quite 100 meters there. What's that 300 yards, something like that. So yeah, that's, that's a pretty good distance there. You can see it takes me a little while to walk back here. So there you go. That's your distance test there with the Saramonic lav mic. I think it is pretty good. I'm really impressed with this setup. Works great. Works great. And another thing that's pretty cool with these microphones is you can connect it up to a camera. You can connect it up to a phone. You've got options on how you can use this setup and it works out pretty good. So you might be thinking, what all comes in the box? Well, here's what comes in the box for you. There you go guys for the entire video here. You did hear the Saramonic Blink 500 Pro XB2 microphone. What do you guys think? Drop a comment down below. Let me know what you thought about the raw audio and what you're hearing now is edited audio that I edited in DaVinci Resolve. We're probably going to apply a little EQ to it and just kind of tune it up, make it sound the best that we can. But if you start with a good quality recording, you're going to be able to edit that audio and make it sound better easier once you get into DaVinci Resolve. Another quick note about this microphone is that you can get a version of this that only has one lav mic and one receiver or RX unit for your camera. And that's going to be a little bit cheaper. It costs you about 200 bucks. So depending on what you need, you know, you decide what might work out best for you. But overall, I think this microphone does a great job. I mean, I've had a good experience using it. I haven't had any problems with it. It works well. It's reliable. The charge and the batteries last long. We can do distance tests. This works out really well. So if you're looking for a lav mic setup, that's the smaller form factor. This is something that you definitely want to check out and consider if it's maybe something that you might be interested in. Now let's say you got the money in the budget and you want to go all out and you want a professional wireless lav system. Well, we will be checking out soon on my channel, this guy right here from Saramonic, which is a professional lav mic system. Let me open this up for you. All right, here we go. Check this out. Comes in a whole nice little kit here. I haven't talked about this one yet, but this one is awesome. It's going to cost you about 500 bucks or so. But it comes with a receiver, it comes with two sending units. It's got lav mics, things to connect to your camera. It has a ton of awesome stuff. Again, you're going to get what you pay for with a lot of microphones and camera equipment, like anything, right? If you want to, you know, spend a minimal amount of money, there's going to be things in there in those kind of products that are just not good or that might not function good for you. But if you want to go pro and high end, Saramonic does have things like that that will do the job for you and do an awesome job for you at that. So we're going to be checking this guy out. So stay tuned for that video if you're interested in a more higher end professional system that would be even better than this, which this is fantastic. Don't get me wrong, this is great. But if you want to go pro, this kit right here is going to come with all the pro gear. So we'll get into that in another video. But with that said guys, close this case up here. I want to thank Saramonic for sending this out for me to try out and share with you guys. I'm just trying to give you guys information and show you how I might use some of these products and how you guys can just take your videos to the next level. In this case, leveling up your audio, right? Super, super important. I talk about audio all the time because I love me some good audio and it's just super important in your videos because if your audio stinks, nobody wants to watch your video. Okay, that's just how it is. I mean, I gotta be honest, nobody wants to watch your video if it doesn't sound good. Okay. All right. Anyway, with that said guys, thank you so much Saramonic. And I will see you guys in the next video. Peace.
