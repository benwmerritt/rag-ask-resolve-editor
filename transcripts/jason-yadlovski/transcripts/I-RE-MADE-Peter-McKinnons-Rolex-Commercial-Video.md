So I'm eating my lunch today, hanging out. I see a new Peter McKinnon video comes out. I'm like, hey, I'm gonna check this out because I love Peter's stuff. And in that video, Peter and Kirk are talking about how they took an ad from Rolex and they decided to re-edit it and add their own sound design in there and kind of just see what they could do with the commercial that was originally on the Rolex website. And that commercial was about a minute 30 or something like that. And Peter and Kirk edited it down to a minute and they did an awesome job. It was really cool. But then as I'm watching the video, Peter says this. If you wanna fill your time with something productive, that also improves your skills along the way. This is a phenomenal exercise, grabbing something that you've seen before, re-cutting it, re-editing it. It's not only fun to do, but you never know who's gonna see your work and you never know where it might land you. And that got me thinking, you know what? Maybe I should give this a try. Hey, why not? I wanna try and make my skills better. I wanna see what I can do. Peter and Kirk came up with an awesome video there. I wanna see what I can do, but instead of using the original Rolex video, I decided I was gonna take Peter and Kirk's video and re-edit that, move things around a little bit, add in my own sound design. So I didn't use any of the sound that Peter and Kirk had put in there. I just went with just the video clips. And one of the goals I had was I wanted to make a 30 second video instead of a one minute video like Peter did. Let's cut it down to 30 seconds, see what we can come up with. And I cut up the video in the same horizontal format and I decided I think I may even make it into a short. I'm still thinking about that. I might do it. But let me go ahead and roll the footage here and you guys tell me what do you think, how do I do? I know Pete and Kirk, man, you guys stuff is awesome as well as Rolex. It's awesome off the bat. So I don't expect to be at that same level of you guys, but hey, let me roll that tape and I wanna hear what you guys think out there. Peter Kirk, you guys watching? If you are, let me know what you think. I roll that tape. Okay. All right, so what'd you guys think? Honest opinion. You're not gonna hurt my feelings. Drop it in the comments. I wanna know what you think. I mean, I thought it came out pretty good. I was impressed with what I came up with. But like Peter and Kirk, I did use Artlist to get all my sound effects and my music and stuff. This is not a sponsored video, but I do use Artlist just like those guys do and it is a great service. So just wanted to let you guys know that's where I did get the sound effects for this particular video. But I do wanna say thanks to Peter and Kirk for putting that idea out there of just taking something, trying it, remixing something, seeing what you can come up with, working your skills a little bit, honing in your craft and just trying things out because a lot of this video editing stuff and YouTube even is just trying stuff out, right? We don't try things. How are we gonna grow and see what we've learned and can we do different things that we might not be too used to be doing or might not be comfortable with? It's just little steps that we gotta take in order to get better and better at our craft here. So thanks to Peter and Kirk for putting that idea out there. Thank you to Rolex for making that awesome commercial to begin with because if it wasn't for that, none of us would have a video about it, right? So hope nobody's mad at me here for using their footage, Peter and Kirk and Rolex. I just thought it'd be a fun project to try out. And oh, by the way, did you guys notice that Peter and Kirk in their video, they are actually using DaVinci Resolve? I mean, as a guy who spends a lot of time in Resolve, I noticed as soon as I saw them screenshots in the video of their edit there, that's DaVinci Resolve. Way to go, guys. I'm glad you're jumping on board on the DaVinci Resolve boat here. DaVinci Resolve is awesome. Love it. All right, guys, thank you so much for watching. If you make an edit like this, not necessarily with Rolex, but with anything, drop it in the comments below. I'd love to check it out. With that said, guys, thank you so much for tuning in. I look forward to seeing you guys in the next one. Peace.
