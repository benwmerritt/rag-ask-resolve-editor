Oh, you guys are in luck today. I am letting you in on some secrets All right, not really secrets, but I've gotten this question so many times in the last couple years that it's about time I make a video about it and answer that question and the question is how do you make those little circle blow up? Highlighter icons in your tutorials. That's really cool. I want to be able to do that, too How do I do that? so I am working on a video here that I'm gonna be posting on my YouTube channel and The program that I actually do that in is not the venture resolve surprisingly It is a program called screen flow and screen flow is the program that I use to record my screen now It is only available for Mac really easy to use Really easy to make quick highlights and stuff like the circle that you guys all want to know about and any of the other Blow-ups a lot of times I just do that in screen flow because it's quicker I don't have to keyframe anything. It's just really fast So let me show you how that works and how I do that right here in screen flow And then if you're on a Mac you can go pick up screen flow and you could do the same cool things that I do All right, let's check it out. So this is screen flow that we're looking at right now I have a project Opened up in there that I've already recorded the screen for now. What's cool with screen follow is I can record my external microphone Which is up here. I can record my screen as well as my screen audio and right now if I just bring up this little guy You can see I'm actually recording the screen right now. It gives me a little levels of my monitor or of my microphone So we've got all this cool stuff that screen flow can do to capture the screen for all my tutorials So I'm just gonna close this guy now when it comes to creating those cool highlights There's a lot of great easy basic tools here in screen flow that allow you to do it real easy So for example, we have a part right here. I want to make a little highlight on the screen So here's the part I got to put in some headphones because I can't hear anything. Hold on Let's roll the tape. You want to make sure that your mixer is open. So at the top here, we have mixer Okay, so I just called out the mixer there and I want that to highlight so that those people watching the viewers Can see where I highlighted it, right? So in order to do it, I'm gonna select my screen recording the bottom one here is my screen recording The top one is my dialogue for my external mic, which is up here. So I want to highlight it I'm gonna select my screen recording and now the tools that we have available to us here in screen flow are across the top here and There's one called Callouts right here. So if I click on this one, it's called call outs now I already have a preset so when I want to create this effect All I have to do is say add an action click on the little thing that's gonna give me my presets and here I have a few presets that I use all the time these are the blow-ups and enlargements that I use all the time It's a custom square highlight where I can select the square I want to highlight the red circle that you guys want to know about and this will just make a red circle around the cursor I have a red circle zoom which gives you a red circle around the cursor and zooms it up I have a highlight square where I can select an area and it'll blow it up for me and I don't have to keyframe anything It's real easy. You can see on the screen. There's this little yellow Icon right here if I click on it now I can adjust all these things here So right now we see that my mouse is highlighted and in my preset This is kind of how I built it right down on the bottom here is basically you're fade in and fade out So I usually do point two seconds. So as I play through the clip you'll see on the screen here It's gonna fade in and you can kind of see it there, but it's a little hard to see right So some of the other things we can adjust right is the opacity, right? Do you want to see the background a lot or not? Then we can zoom it up right here. We can make it bigger or smaller I'm gonna put it back to a hundred percent for the moment. We can add a border, right? So if I bring this up, you see it just makes the border around My mouse cursor a little bit bigger, right? So we can size it however we want and then right below that I have the option to add an outline, right? So in this case the default color happens to be blue and if I just click up my pixel size You can see we now have a blue border around the cursor there So I can you can make it as big as you want or as small as you want I can click on the color and it'll bring your color panel mine's red you can make it red or whatever color that you want and Then I'm just gonna go ahead and close that and Now we have a simple fade in to a highlighted area Let's say I want to you know make it a little bit bigger so I'm gonna increase my border size and Now I have the highlight area, right? And if I want to zoom it up again right here We've got zoom up I can just click hold and drag and you can make it as big as you want, you know It's up to you Let's say I want to make it this big right as we go up to select the mixer there and DaVinci Resolve The other thing I want to do is just have it fade out at the very end so under build right here I have out duration. I make that point to it's good enough It's good to go and all the settings that you save in here you can Save as a preset you can save it and then you only have to click the preset and boom there you go It's gonna drop it on your timeline now under highlight I have the mouse cursor, but you could do a foreground window which you can draw the window yourself You could do a freehand window that's draw yourself actually So you've got different options on how you can set that up, right? So now if I play through it, here's what it looks like after making those few simple changes You want to make sure that your mixer is open so at the top here? Okay, so let's say maybe it didn't quite line up where I wanted it to if I zoom in on my timeline here I could just grab this which is my effect my zoom in and I'm just gonna drag it down to where I want it to start So let's try it maybe there you want to make sure that your mixer is open So at the top here we have mixer, okay, and then let's say okay. I don't need anymore I want it to fade back down It's as easy as coming in dragging the end of my little call-out clip here. Just drag it back and that's it I mean, it's just that you have mixer and in our mixer We have and let's say I want to have another one for the EQ instead of doing it all over again I could apply the preset if I have it or I could just click it control C and a click over here Control V boom it just pasted it and now I've got that same effect twice in a timeline no keyframes Nothing I just pop it on there really quick and really easy check it out And so at the top here we have mixer and in our mixer We have our EQ right here on my vocal track So I'm gonna and that's it that is how I create those cool pop outs and blow-ups and things now the preset Just to show you how it works again. I have my track selected with my screen recording. I'm gonna come up I'm gonna add an action click on my preset I'm gonna say circle cursor red zoom up and now when I play through it a double click that to open up my EQ You can see it zooms up on the screen there And it's as easy as that I can then just drag it as long as I need it and it's gonna fade in fade out Everything is set. It's really quick and really easy I just find it faster to do it this way in the screen flow go through real quick drop in my couple of You know places that I want to create an enlargement or zoom in or draw your attention to something And then I can export this out And then I bring it into DaVinci Resolve and then start editing my whole project together with my talking head like you see right here As well as the screen recording which already has all the blow-ups and everything in it Now the other cool thing that I do very often with the screen recordings is in screen flow again right here I want my mouse cursor to highlight or light up when I click the mouse button Right to kind of help draw the viewers attention to whatever I'm trying to show in the video in DaVinci Resolve So to do that really easy again I have a preset made for it But I would just click on my screen flow track or on my screen recording track this time I'm gonna come up to this icon right here, which is the screen recording itself And now you can adjust all these different things in here your mouse pointer zoom you can make it bigger smaller You can change what the mouse cursor looks like But the effect that I use is called radar and you can change the size of it the color of it the animation all these different things and And change it and make it look however you want now. I have a preset so I would just click on my presets I have two different ones here. I have default mouse plus radar So I'm gonna click on that and that's it. It's applied if anytime I click the mouse It's gonna have that radar on there I don't have to go through and and change it and let me play through a little bit of it here and see you can see what it looks like Three to four thousand Okay, so you can see I just click there on the EQ and you saw those little radar Things light up right just to help draw the viewers attention to those specific parts that I'm talking about in the video So I use that one all the time and that one will apply to the entire screen recording It's not like an individual thing that I can move around it just applies to the whole thing Which is what I want in my case because I want to draw the viewers attention To the things I'm clicking on and the things I'm talking about in DaVinci resolve because if I didn't How good of a tutorial would it be right? I do have a preset for the square ones to blow it up or to just highlight it and dim the rest of the screen No matter fact, you know what? I'm just gonna show you that real quick So let's say I want to highlight the EQ in this particular screen here. I'm gonna select my screen recording I'm gonna go back to my call out I'm gonna go action which adds the call out onto the clip for me the screen recording and then I'm gonna go select my preset and In this case, I just want to highlight because I know if I blow the EQ up It's gonna be too big on the screen So I'm gonna say custom square highlight now I can use a circle and just draw and paint it in or you can use the square So all I have to do is come and highlight The EQ like this and now when I play through it I've already got a fade in and a fade out on this call out and this is what it looks like Up to 8,000 is kind of where we want to increase but you could just Fades in fades out really easy and say I decided I want to zoom this up Right, I could click on the call out and I can just come up into the zoom up and I could just zoom it up It's as easy as that right so maybe I'm like, oh, I do actually have some room I can zoom the EQ up that big on the screen and then I can keep myself in my talking head down over here So really easy to kind of make quick adjustments here in screen flow This is why I love using screen flow as my screen recording software for all my DaVinci resolve tutorials I've pretty much been using only this since the beginning. I did try the I did try OBS once but I just found it a little too cumbersome and I just found that this is way easier And faster for me because I got used to it I'm sure OBS is great and it's fine if you're familiar with it, but this was easier for me So screen flow is awesome. I use it all the time for every screen recording that I do It's a great program if you guys need a screen recording program and you're on a Mac I would highly recommend screen flow not sponsored. This is not but I've never even talked to anybody at screen flow But I do love the program. It does do a good job I'll drop a link in the description below if you want to jump over and check it out And then I'll update my version like maybe every two versions or something like that Generally, I'm not using a ton of features although you could edit your entire video right here in screen flow Generally, I don't I'm gonna do my you know my my call outs and things and highlighting on the screen in screen flow I'm gonna export that out Bring it into DaVinci resolve and I make all my videos in DaVinci resolve otherwise And I can continue to add in some more things in resolve like, you know Maybe different kinds of blow-ups or different ways of you know making things look interesting I definitely add a lot in DaVinci resolve But for this just the screen recording itself I use screen flow because it does a great job It's easy and I just I have no problems with it. It runs great on my Mac So that is it. I hope you guys found this helpful on how I do these cool little You know animations and blow-ups and stuff on my videos here for DaVinci resolve If you have questions about screen flow, you want to know a little more Maybe you want to see another video about something Drop a comment down below. Let me know. I'm happy to make videos about this and help out the community So you can make your own tutorials in DaVinci resolve or maybe you're just recording screens for something else Maybe I don't I have no idea. I have no idea what you might be doing But if you need a screen recorder screen flow works awesome. All right guys. Thank you so much for watching I will see you in the next DaVinci resolve video. Peace
