What is going on guys welcome to the DeVitia Resolve podcast guys it's getting to the end of 2024 here trying to get out another podcast for you and next year I'm hoping to be a little more on top of this podcast thing because one it's fun two I can answer your questions a little more in detail than I can in a comment and maybe we might even get some guests on if I can muster up the courage to ask a few people so today we're going to be walking through some more questions that you guys have on different videos of mine here in DeVitia Resolve but let's just jump right into all the good stuff right so recently we got an update DeVitia Resolve 19 but furthermore 19.1 and 19.1.1 so we've got a bunch of updates in there there's so much good stuff I've got videos going through a lot of it and you know our other creator friends out there have a ton of videos on all the new features and everything as well so if you haven't upgraded yet I would recommend backup your database backup anything else you might need just in case I mean usually there's no problems but you never know so I would go ahead back everything up and then go ahead and install the new version now one question I do get a lot is do I need to uninstall the old version of Resolve or if you're going from the free version to the studio do I need to uninstall the existing version of Resolve on my computer before I install the new version or the updated version or studio and the answer that is no I've never uninstalled a program or a DeVitia Resolve what do you call it um version I guess uh DeVitia Resolve version before I installed a new one now generally I am going to back up my database because I just want to be safe rather than sorry in case something goes wrong but actually nothing's ever gone wrong for me I'm on a Mac but nothing's gone wrong I just installed the new version and it overwrites the old version and is good to go and it's always kept all my you know power bins and anything else that I have like set as far as settings and stuff it keeps all that right in Resolve so no need to uninstall anything before installing the new version so keep that in mind but back up your stuff go ahead download the new version install it and you'll get all these awesome new features so let's get into the first question here I just have a whole bunch of kind of randoms and we're going to just run through them here so this question here is on a video about fast tracks and DeVitia Resolve 19 a quality of life tip a video that I got so it says Jason an excellent feature to share with all of us do you have any reservations about upgrading from version 18 to 19 with all the projects completed and no dependence on version 18 are there any technical concerns you may have that are drawbacks or should feel comfortable download or should I feel comfortable downloading 19 I love the new features I've studio but was concerned with the beta version thanks for all you do so like we just talked about you know you don't need to uninstall anything to install the updated version and I see no reason not to upgrade to the venture resolve 19 I mean there I have found everything's pretty stable and if there's any issues they do fix it pretty quickly but you shouldn't have any problems going from 18 to 19 now that said if you're in the middle of a project maybe you want to just wait a little bit and finish up that project before upgrading just in case that's probably a good idea depending on how big the project is but I wouldn't have any concern about upgrading to 19 it's solid I mean I've had no issues there's been a few little issues here and there for people but I think with the latest 19.1.1 I think they fixed all those issues at least anything that I saw and again just usually more issues on a PC than on a Mac so you should go buy a Mac all right now I get people love their PCs right and I used to be a PC guy too but it seems like if there are any issues it's more on the PC side than on the Mac side so that's just kind of the vibe I get from you know comments that that come in on my channel here so I don't know why that is I think it just for whatever reason runs a little better on a Mac let's see next question here hi Jason I'm unable to open the preset library for some reason it's grayed out how can I enable it so the preset library when you're in a fair light I'm assuming it should open up now it should open up and even if you don't have any presets that you created there are some presets now in Resolve 19 that are kind of built in there as far as like some EQ stuff and things like that so if it's grayed out something's up with that maybe you have something else selected or usually there's a reason you can't select something in the menu maybe you have another command active or how to try restarting sometimes you know I think it's just a little I don't know I'm gonna say you're you selected on the wrong thing or something but usually even if you've got studio or I mean you have the free version but it's a studio feature you're still going to be able to you know put it on there or access it or try it in the free version it's just usually going to have a watermark or you know give you some kind of message or something like that so it should should work so I don't know all right here's another comment here let's see hey Jason I've used many of your videos to help me learn the software I'm an amateur videographer that shoots videos of local bands I know most of your tutorials are designed to help vloggers but I was wondering if you could potentially do more for editing music video content thanks for all you do all right so music videos now I did have a big series that I did where we worked with some music we edited music we created the song we mixed it we edited it we did all that kind of stuff with a multi-track recording that I did I created a multi-track recording we brought in resolve we organized we did all that fun stuff we even got to use some of the cool tools from black magic design to to try it out like their big fairlight panel and stuff like that so it's a 100 possible if you want to mix everything in resolve you can do that you can use all of your audio plugins that you would typically use in any other DAW or audio program I've got tons of waves plugins that work really well so you can load all those up now if you're making a music video I almost feel like your song and your music is already going to be you know like mixed mastered all that stuff maybe it's already done and now you've filmed the band right and now you're just laying the song or well the images on top of the song right so the way that kind of works at least in my mind how I would do that and I did ask them like you know what would you want to see you know when it comes to working with music and they say basically the any of the challenging parts of video editing like some of the background noises color correction EQ options all that kind of stuff so when you're doing the music video a couple things just kind of high level stuff that I'm thinking is you're getting your footage but you're not actually using the audio that you're recording at the time you're recording it now you need the band singing their song or whatever but you're going to have a fully mastered you know perfect track that you're going to lay underneath that and and that's going to be your audio for the video at least in my opinion right you're not going to use what they're doing live because you're just not going to pick it up well right if they have a recording that's what you want to use and the way I would do it is you know you film multiple shots have them running through their song or their set or whatever you do a bunch of times and you know I would then kind of try and line up you know the different parts of the song with the shots that you got and make sure you've got the whole song covered from multiple angles so that's kind of how I would do that if you're just talking about oh hey I'm just at the you know at the local pub and I'm recording the band and I want to throw together a video okay that's a little bit different then you're going to use you know what you get and and and kind of just take it from there but I guess it kind of depends on what you're wanting to do but I don't know music videos is fun it's something you can totally do and resolve from the mixing of the audio all the way you know or the music and the songs all the way up to you know your whole video yourself so um so yeah so maybe those videos that I've already got will help you out a little bit and uh if not let me know let me know I'm always happy to make videos about all kinds of audio stuff all right next we have a question on a video I made we've called save hours in DaVinci Resolve 19 with these 11 automatic features says do you trust the audio leveler for serious projects or can it potentially cause unwanted gain could it turn your background music up too loud and suddenly drop the levels again I fear by pressing that you will need to listen to your whole mix through to make sure I didn't mess anything up and I would kind of agree with that right if I got a serious project I'm probably not using the dialogue leveler I'm going to go through I'm going to manually listen everything adjust my levels and set things where I want them so they stay there and I don't have to worry about like you said anything happening in the background there sometimes some of those features you know they may not kick in right away or something might get messed up in the render and I would definitely listen to it all and make sure that nothing got out of whack you know if you're using something like dialogue leveler that said I've had good experience with it I know Mr. Alex tech uses it all the time on all his videos it should work just fine you shouldn't have any problems but if it's a serious project I'm not going to use the dialogue leveler for me I'm going to just set everything manually exactly where I want them to be so hopefully that answers that question next up on audio updates in DaVinci Resolve 19.1 please please please make a fair light tutorial on how to phase match different mics simply like the way we do it in Pro Tools using Auto Align or any other way to do it in Fairlight I'm requesting this for the third time so I'm going to have to look into that because I don't know how to do that I'm going to have to look it up and see how you do it in something like Pro Tools I just had never came across an experience where I needed to do that but I know that could be a problem when the mics are out of phase or whatever so that's something I'll look into and I'll get back to you on that so you may have to ask for a fourth time or a fifth time because sometimes I don't listen so well but I'm going to try and get to that for you next up on the video see what you're missing free versus studio track level audio effects and the comment here was why not using two computers one with studio one with free so if you're using two computers and you have studio you actually get two licenses for studio so you don't need to use the free version you can do you know use studio on both computers and I'm not sure if maybe they just were saying you know in my case in particular because I make tutorials for you guys have one computer that's got studio with the works on it and then have one computer that's a little more basic that just has the free version so that way I can just show you guys what the free version looks like and work in the free version because obviously I've got studio so I'm not you know swapping back and forth between the free version in studio I'll just usually mention okay this is only in studio this is in the free version or whatever so I mean they got a point there you know just cost some money that's all money set up you know but it's a good it's a good point and maybe one day I'll I'll think about doing that next to comment on how to keyframe audio in DaVinci Resolve 18 it's the same in 18 17 19 whatever it doesn't matter keyframe and audio is the same is it possible to keyframe effects like the low pass filter and eq effects yeah you can keyframe any audio parameter that you can dream of right whether it's part of an effect part of the eq part of the dynamics a plug in whatever it is you can keyframe every single part of your audio now when it comes to audio in fair light it's not actually called keyframing they call it automation and all automation is is essentially keyframing but it's just making changes over time so you have to use the automation tools to be able to keyframe I'm doing air quotes here keyframe those different effects and stuff so I'm gonna turn off my phone here because we're getting some messages so if you want to do that you gotta use automation I have a video that has a really great example in there of how automation works and how we can use it to change the eq and pan and do all kinds of other stuff so you want to check that out just head on over to youtube and search automation Jason Yadlowski and it should pop up it's me you see a picture of me something that was me in the van in my van you know and I run through a cool little example there for you so keyframing in audio is called automation and that's what you want to look for next question on a video called five tips and div entries of 18 you should know when using remote grades for color grading I noticed that all my other clips on the timeline go flat again as if they're still in log format ungraded it's not until I press and return to use local grades that my colors return again any idea why yeah so if you're using the remote grades when it comes to color grading that's going to allow you to basically make changes on one clip from a camera and all the other clips from that camera are going to have the exact same changes so really you're just doing it once and it gets applied to all of the clips from that particular camera recording right so obviously if you have three different recordings from say this camera I'm using right now each one of those three different recordings you know would be separate it's not like you know once for the camera it's once for the recorded clip that you would make the change in your color grade and it would get applied to all those other cuts of that particular clip so what seems like it's happening here is that you've got it on local grades you go ahead and you make your color grade changes and then you change it to remote grades and it essentially shuts off the local grades so you can only use either from the way I understand it and again I'm not a color grading expert but the way I use it is either do remote grades where everything is a remote grade all the clips in your timelines are remote grades or you use the local grades and color grade every individual clip they can copy and paste it around and all that but yeah so when you switch from local grades to remote grades it's not showing what you have on your local grade so that's why your video looks like it's going back into log format so one thing keep in mind there local grades versus remote grades you've got to kind of think about how you want to do your project and kind of just pick away and go with it next up question on mastering audio in DaVinci Resolve 19 yes every project needs it that's true that's true it says I bought your audio course and I also got the EQ presets I saw that you lift some of the channels and I think they mean frequencies would love an explanation about that so when it comes to EQ right I've got a whole crash course on I think I'm gonna actually make a new one soon here too but the concepts are all the same when it comes to EQ what I like to use EQ for is primarily removing things that don't sound good so in general you want to make cuts in your EQ so grab a frequency and drop it down make cuts at problem areas right we're trying to use the EQ to take care of problems now that's generally the first thing I'm going to do make cuts to take care of problems but then there's sometimes where I do want to boost up certain parts of the EQ now why might I want to boost something when it comes to EQ well if I've got a microphone that maybe is a little uh you know unclear I want to add some clarity to it I could grab a point on the EQ that is in the you know say 4 to 8k range and boost that up a little bit and that's going to introduce some more clarity to my dialogue at the same regard you might want a little more bass in your uh video right maybe you have a music track or I don't know whatever you want more bass in it so in that case maybe I'm going to grab you know a point make a nice little bell curve somewhere in that I don't know 150 to 300 hertz range maybe 200 to 250 somewhere around there I'm going to make a little boost and add in a little extra bass so when you boost your EQ that's going to increase or add in that frequency range um and then when you drop your points in the EQ or cut it's going to remove sounds in those frequencies so in general I like to say it like this you want to make cuts before you ever boost anything right we need to get rid of the things that don't sound good before we go ahead and boost anything and most of the time making cuts is going to take care of your problems so well for the most part I mean all right there's all kinds of problems right let's be honest but for the most part if you've got you know a particular frequency that's really kind of harsh on the ear the EQ is going to do a good job of taking care of that and removing it but there are times when you can boost uh your EQ but for the most part I generally make cuts and if you do boost you probably don't want to boost too much just a little bit on to do it next up a question on a video I did called remove reverb from dialogue in DaVinci Resolve he says hey Jason is there any feature in resolve that does de reverb and I'm gonna have to say no uh the voice isolation does great with background noise but it doesn't do a great job does not do a great job with reverb so there's no built-in tools that I found that really kind of take care of the reverb the plugin that I used in this video that was mentioned here where the comment was left was a waves de reverb plugin so I guess the way plugins have to handle reverb versus background noise is a little bit different right they need to remove those reverberations and stuff so whatever however it works on the back end I don't know about that stuff but under the hood there it's doing something different to analyze the audio and remove the reverb so waves has a good one I'm sure there's plenty other ones out there too but you'd have to go third party plugin if you want something that's going to do a decent job of removing reverb now maybe down the road black magical add in a plugin that does reverb I wouldn't say no they're not gonna because they keep adding stuff that people want so I think that would be a great plugin for them to add in uh and you know just give people the option to remove the reverb in addition to the background noise I mean voice isolation is so good maybe you could just uh you know tweak it a little bit and then have a good de reverb plugin so I don't know how about it black magic can we get that next on a video uh called how to backup and restore your DaVinci Resolve 18 database or project library used to be called database now it's a project library same same you know tomato tomato you know I mean all right the question is my resolve backup has taken about 60 gigs in my macbook internal storage can I delete that as my live save is already on so you have backup files um I mean I think if you got through a project you probably don't need to keep the backup files right if you finish the project I know for me every once in a while I'll go through I'll clear out all my my my cache files even the backups like after I've done the project and most of the time I don't need it you can also just set your settings to not keep as many backups right I think it's I forget if it's in preferences or project settings off the top of my head I think it's preferences but you can set it to not save as many backups if you want but I mean you could delete the backups I mean if you don't think you need them um or maybe you just want to move to another hard drive but you know 60 gigs that's kind of clogging up a macbook there so you might want to take care of some of it you know but live save is not doing the same thing as backups right live save is just saving it incrementally every change you make right every time you do something it's going to save it so it's just constantly saving your one file right backing it up is just taking is taking that project file at a point in time and saving it you know off to the side in wherever you tell it to save it and then it just it'll sit there so live save is a little different than than backing up but if you backup your database you know maybe once a month or something then you don't necessarily need the individual project backups but I do keep it all turned on and backing everything up just in case because you never know you never know when something's going to happen so um yeah it's up to you what you want to do those backups there next up question on a video 10 amazing reasons to buy DaVinci Resolve studio ps it's also on sale at the time of this recording I think it's still on sale for 235 USD and it is what's today December 16th 2024 coming up on the Christmas Christmas day here and everything so his question is great video I wanted to ask a couple of questions could you tell me what model your headphone is so the headphones I'm currently using that I most use most often are the Barodynamic DT770 Pros and they are the 80 ohm version they do make different ohm versions I think they have a 35 ohm which is great if you're just plugging like straight into a laptop or something like that they have the 80 and then the 250 ohm versions now for the 80 and the 250 you probably it's you're better off if you plug it into an audio interface which is what I do plug it into the EVO 4 so that's that I once tried a Barodynamic with my MacBook Pro and it had very little volume they told me this because of the ohms and that's that's 100% true so if you plug in a 250 ohms set of headphones into your laptop it's gonna sound too quiet right the the that the 250 ohms headphones needs more power to drive those speakers so that way you know they they function and sound the way they're supposed to right if you're plugging directly in the laptop you need a low ohms version of headphones like the 35s I think it's 35s I don't know I got the 80s because it was kind of in the middle like I could plug it into a laptop might be a little quiet but I could plug it in the laptop but if I also plug it into my audio interface it's going to get plenty of juice so you probably had the the 250 ohms version and then he says secondly do you have a tutorial or could you tell me if it's possible to make a preset from the delivery page so I can export audio stems uh so yeah you I mean you could you know set up multiple uh you know buses and stuff and and you know create however you want you could create renderings of just specific audio tracks or you know send them all out at the same time it you could definitely do it I might have to poke in there a little round a little bit and just kind of get the settings but that's totally possible yeah you you could do stems if you wanted to from the deliver page next up a question on a video audio updates and divintry solve 19.1 uh from vegan thank thank you for the update Jason a question out of topic maybe do you always shoot your video with constant exposure for example 25 frames per second at 1 over 50 50 frames per second at 1 over 60 and so on or is it not always necessary to follow this rule thanks so in general yes that's uh that's correct I think they call it the 180 rule I think this was called um so if I'm filming at 24 frames per second or my timeline's going to be 24 frames per second my camera set at 24 frames per second I want to have my shutter speed at 1 over 48 in theory or 1 over 50 it's close enough right so yeah essentially you want to take your frame rate you want to double it and that's what your shutter speed should be on your camera now though if you're using something like a DSLR or you know mirrorless camera nowadays um you may need to set that manually but on a camera like my C100 right here I could just program in a setting and say 180 degrees so that way whatever I set my frame rate at generally it's 29 97 it's automatically going to double the shutter speed for me so I don't have to set the shutter speed every time all I gotta do is pick my frame rate and because I have it set to 180 it'll automatically you know double it and then that's the shutter speed so in general yeah you always want to try and follow that rule now can you get away without using those kind of shutter speeds yeah sure I mean I think I've heard you know Peter McKinnon and Maddie and all those guys talk about like sometimes yeah just roll the shutter down you know if I need to change my exposure real quick I'll just change the shutter and keep on filming and that's fine works out fine but if you got a choice I would you know use that 180 rule and you should be fine but if not hey you do what you gotta do and the video is probably still going to be usable so hopefully that helps answer the question next up easy vfx you can do superhero landing in DaVinci Resolve 19 why is there a faster option in the magic mask I have never or have I seen or have I seen a tutorial where anyone uses it I've only used it when I forgot to select the better and then realize it and then I go select better so yeah magic mask if you don't know you have two options when you're trying to create the magic mask you've got a faster option and then you've got the better option and obviously better is better but faster is faster and sometimes faster works just fine so if you don't need all the processing power you don't want to wait for it you got a long clip track or something and faster does a good job for you it might be worth a shot you know or if you just testing some things out you want to see how it looks go with faster run it and then you know if you want to keep it cool if not you change it up but you can always try the better one and yeah better is going to give you better results but depending on the complexity of your shot maybe you only need to use faster and that just gets the job done a little bit quicker so um yeah I think it's just a a way that you can do things quicker when you're just trying to cruise through stuff you know it's like if you want to use optical flow but that's not the default setting right because it kind of slows things down a little bit you know you use uh what a nearest is that the standard maybe I don't know but it processes quicker so in my case I mean I generally use better as well I mean I'm with you on that so yeah I don't know use better if you want to get done quicker try faster all right a question on the making voiceovers in DaVinci Resolve what is the best troubleshooting approach if DaVinci is trying the microphone is tying tying the microphone into the track but the meters don't respond to sounds from the mic when you arm it to record a lot a lot of things could be happening here I know people have issues all the time with trying to record directly in a resolve so things to keep in mind when you're going to record in a resolve first thing set up your microphone as the input in preferences or is it project settings let me take a quick look here I think it's uh oh because I'm recording in resolve I can't can't check it right now I think it's in one of those right you want to make sure that I think it's in preferences that your microphone is set as the input for DaVinci Resolve next you want to go and go ahead and patch your microphone to a track if the patch looks like it works seems good you should be able to jump in the track arm it to record and once you arm it if you haven't changed anything you should see the meters moving now if you don't you might want to go to the fairlight menu right up at the top and then down to oh input monitor style and that is just the way the microphone and resolve responds to what you can hear either before your recording while you're recording it can do it automatically so essentially you could leave it on auto and usually it's going to show you the meters moving before you record you're going to hear yourself why you're recording so you can monitor um but yeah so you want to make sure that that's on auto you could try the different settings there there's input auto record mute and repo pro you could try that and see if it works for you and um usually I think one of those things is not checked on if the patch and everything else looks good that's probably why you're not uh getting anything in DaVinci Resolve you know from your headphones you know you don't see the meters moving and you don't hear yourself you're not monitoring because one of those settings is a little out of whack so um that's where I would check first next question on 10 keyboard shortcuts for faster editing DaVinci Resolve uh how do I do the exact same cut without cutting the audio track along with the clip I want cut all right so I think this is talking about a few keyboard shortcuts I had I used my um Q, W and S keys for keyboard shortcuts to make a cut which is S um ripple delete to the left is Q and ripple delete to the right is W so it'll make a cut ripple delete make a cut ripple delete um if you only wanted to do that to say you know the video part of your audio uh I'm sorry the video part of a clip not the audio part you could use your auto track selectors to you know have only the track selected that you want you could use your option or alt key to select just the video portion of a clip even if they're linked it'll allow you to select just the video or just the audio um or you could turn tracks on and off you know you could lock tracks a lot of different ways that you can you know isolate one particular track where you might want to make cuts and stuff but you don't want to affect anything else so uh those are the kind of methods I would look into for doing something like that next question on my go to audio mastering plugins for DaVinci Resolve 19 so I used some waves plugins uh but they had a great question here it said nice video do these plugins uh the ones I showed the video which were waves plugins process audio differently compared to DaVinci Resolve's built-in audio effects such as the limiter so when it comes to plugins every plugin is gonna process audio a little bit differently I think that's the whole uh draw to plugins right the way that the built-in plugins in Resolve process and do things behind the scenes is going to be different than a plugin you might download from wherever else in this case waves so yeah they're gonna work differently they're gonna do different things they may sound a little similar at the end of the day but they're gonna work differently that's why there's so many different plugins for audio it's kind of like think about LUTs right you've got a gazillion different LUTs out there right and audio plugins are are kind of the same right you can get a plugin it does some things under the hood in a particular way uh you know maybe you want to process it a certain way or if you're not even sure you might just download it try and you're like okay I kind of like that and generally they're gonna have some presets in there and stuff and it's going to give you a great starting point uh to kind of tweak things from there or if it sounds good you just leave it on the preset that that comes you know with any of the any of the audio plugins there so yeah they're going to sound different they're going to work different than the built-in plugins in DaVinci Resolve does that mean they're better not necessarily depends on what you want it to sound like what you're trying to accomplish um in general I've found you know some plugins are are good some plugins aren't some I don't know how to work well some I do um you know you just got to try them and see what the result is and if it accomplishes whatever you want to accomplish so yeah they're going to sound different uh they work different but you're big picture wise you're still accomplishing the same kinds of things next question on game changer automatically sync power bins and more in DaVinci Resolve so I made a video recently now in uh I think it says of 19 I don't know 19.1 one of the 19s you can have your power bins as well as your regular bins automatically sync up between your hard drive file and the bin in DaVinci Resolve it's just automatically going to pop in new files when you add something to your files on your hard drive it's automatically going to pop it right up into DaVinci Resolve which is a huge time saver for me um it says the question is does it work with pictures graphics and jpegs and from my test no it doesn't work with images so far which I don't know why wouldn't I mean it works with video clips any kind of video clip any kind of audio clip I've had no problems with different formats of videos and audio I don't know why it wouldn't work with pictures and images too but I'm sure that's common they got to be adding that in there right so it doesn't work yet but hopefully it will hear soon but great great feature that got added because if uh for example with my power bins I have music and sound effects power bins and I add them on my hard drive but then I always had to drag them from the hard drive drop them in the power bin make sure it syncs it all up but now I can just have Resolve automatically do that so I'll just put everything you know my new music files for example into the folder that's on my hard drive it'll automatically show up in my power bin in DaVinci Resolve so loving that I've been wanting that for quite a while and I didn't even know that was there until I stumbled on it the other last week or the week before whenever I put out that video because I was like dude gotta make a video about this so all right last question we have here is on DaVinci Resolve EQ crash course thanks mate but how can I increase bass for just a short moment now let's say you're listening to some song and at a particular point in the song you want more bass you want that thumping bass or whatever right so you can boost your EQ and that's how you're going to get more bass out of it but you don't want it to be like that the entire time so how do we do that that's where you would use something like automation right we would have our automation turned on we can listen to our playback and then at the point in our song where we wanted to have more bass we could just grab that point in our EQ and boost it up and then when we wanted to go away grab that point bring it back down and resolve when using automation is going to record those changes that you make over time and it's going to automate and automatically do those changes for you so you can't keyframe the EQ like typical keyframing you know for some of your basic audio parameters like volume and pan or like you would keyframe a video but this process is the same it does the same thing but it's just called automation right a little bit different way to do it it's a little bit more complicated i would say than regular keyframing but i've got a video on it i can show you you know how to how to do it it's not that hard once you kind of understand the concept of how it works and what you got to do so automation is the way to go for something like that there are other workarounds that might not work as good like you could drop that portion of your music into another track and then you know change the EQ on that particular track and you know maybe do something like that but the automation is going to give you the best result right because it's going to be exactly what you want so takes a little bit of getting used to but it's overall it's not too bad so that wraps up all the questions that i have for this DaVinci Resolve podcast if you want to ask questions and have me answer them here on the podcast i don't know post it on my channel somewhere hashtag it DaVinci Resolve
