100,000 subscribers. Guys, I can't believe we are at this point on my channel here where we have 100,000 people that have subscribed to my channel. 100,000 people care what I gotta say. Seems crazy. I never would have expected it or thought it would have happened, you know, to me on this channel. When I got started, it's just been a lot of hard work and grinding and just making videos to help you guys out there. And I can't thank you guys enough because without you guys out there subscribing, watching, liking, commenting, I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't be able to do this as a job to be able to help all of you out there. So I've rounded up a bunch of awesome giveaways for you guys. I want to give something back to you guys. I've got a bunch of things and I just want to tell you what they are real quick. And to sign up, I'll leave a link in the description below. Hit up that link. It'll bring you over to my Shopify. Sign up with your email. If you scroll down the page a little, you can pop in your email and I'm going to randomly select emails for winners for all of these awesome prizes. So here we go. Here's what we got. First up, we have two studio licenses from Blackmagic Design. Thank you Blackmagic for just providing these and just for the awesome program that is DaVinci Resolve. Fairlight panel right here too. And thank you for the opportunity to give away two studio licenses of DaVinci Resolve. Next up, we have Artlist and Artlist has been a long term sponsor of my channel. I love Artlist. Tons of great stuff on there and they are giving away one full year subscription to their music and sound effects service. So if you want to bring your videos to the next level, that's a great thing to win. Lots of great assets there that you can use to put in your projects and help make it more awesome. Epidemic Sound. I love you guys. Thank you so much Epidemic Sound. Epidemic Sound is giving away two six month subscriptions for free. Now what do I love about Epidemic Sound? Well one, they've got great stuff. But two, I love how they have stems to all their music. It is fantastic. If you just want the drums, you just want the bass, maybe you just want the vocals. You can grab the stems from any one of the songs or the music that are on their website. Also have great sound effects there. Love Epidemic Sound. And thank you guys Epidemic Sound for supporting my channel and for providing two six month subscriptions for the giveaway. Another great partner of mine is Waves. Waves makes a ton of awesome plugins for audio stuff, for dialogue, for pretty much anything you want to do when it comes to your audio. They've been in the game a long time, especially in the music industry. And I've partnered up with them for the last year or two. They are awesome. They have a ton of great stuff and Waves is offering a free plugin for everyone. So you, you, you, you, everybody is going to get the free plugin. It's going to be free for 48 hours. So stay tuned to my channel because when I make a post on the community page as well as a video, it's going to be the Manny Markoin EQ. I think I said it right there. But we're going to be giving that away for free for 48 hours. So stay tuned to my channel because as soon as we get over that 100,000 subscriber mark, we are going to put out a link. You can go and download that plugin for free. So a huge thank you to Waves for the opportunity for everyone out there to be able to grab this free plugin, which is an awesome plugin by the way. And I'll show you how to use it when the video comes out. Let me know that it's free for 48 hours. Next up, we have Storyblocks. If you haven't heard about Storyblocks and you're into video and video editing, you're probably living under a rock. Storyblocks has a ton of great assets that just help bring your videos to the next level. They've got all kinds of footage and sound effects, music. They've got the whole package of everything that you might need to make your video awesome. Storyblocks has given away one year for free, a free year subscription to their service there. You can jump on there, grab anything you want for a whole year, and really just help bring your videos to the next level. So thank you Storyblocks for contributing that to the giveaway. Next up, we have two awesome microphones by Samson. If you've seen the DaVinci Resolve podcast, you know I use the Q9X on there, and it is fantastic. Love that microphone. But Samson has given us two G-Track Pro microphones to give away. These things are great. I used it in a bunch of videos. I use it whenever I need a high quality USB microphone. Does an awesome job, and I think any of you guys would be excited to have this microphone and see how awesome it does. Thank you to Samson for providing those two microphones for the giveaway. Next up, we have an awesome giveaway. It is from our friend, Mr. Casey Ferris, and that is his Fusion Zero to Hero course worth 850 bucks. He's going to give one of those away to you guys.

We love Casey. We love his channel. Casey, thank you so much for providing this for my 100k subs giveaway. Speaking of our friends, you guys might know this guy, Mr. Alex Tech. Mr. Alex Tech has offered to give away five free copies of the paid full version of MagicAnimate V3. So if you win that, I'm going to be sending you a link where you can go ahead and go download that for free. But Alex is awesome if you've been around YouTube for a while and you watch Resolve. Again, you know Mr. Alex Tech, and you know how awesome MagicAnimate V3 is if you see any of his videos or any of our other friends who've shared MagicAnimate and how awesome it is for them. So a big thank you to Casey and Alex for sending that stuff in to give away to you guys. And last but not least, I am giving away five of my EQ presets pack number one and pack number two. So if you're a little worried about EQ, how it all works, what to do, you can have these EQ presets packed, drop them on there, try it out, see what might work good for your clips.
