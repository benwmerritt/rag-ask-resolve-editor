We are back for another quick tip Tuesday here guys and today I want to talk about power bins. How do you back up or save your power bins so you don't have to recreate it if you start a new database or maybe something happens to your machine, everything crashes out, you lose everything. How do we save those power bins so you don't have to recreate them all? Let's jump and resolve and I'll show you how to do it. It's quick and easy. So in resolve here I've got my power bins open right here. If you don't see your power bins or maybe you're not familiar with power bins, open up your media pool. If you don't see them, click on the three little dots here show power bins. You want to make sure that's checked on. Now the power bins, you can set up however you want with whatever folders you want. If you want to save them, right click on master, come on down to export bin. So you'll be able to save those bins as whatever you want. I'm going to call them master power bins. You can select wherever you'd like to save them. Go ahead and hit save. Resolve will save out your power bins. And now if you started a new database or maybe you needed to just delete this and restore it or something, all you have to do is come to your power bins, you can right click on there and then come down to import bin. Go find those power bins wherever you saved them, click open and boom, there is going to be all of your power bins. Now the cool little bonus tip here about power bins just to throw it in there real quick. If you have a directory on your hard drive where you dump all of your assets like for example, I have a music folder right here and I've got my different music in different folders, I can now right click on here and come down to resync media files. And it's going to add any new files that I dumped into those folders on my hard drive, it's going to automatically put them in here into my power bins. So that is a new feature here in DaVinci Resolve 19 where you can just have the bins automatically update for you. Hopefully soon we don't have to hit that resync media button and resolve will just know to look in the folders where our power bins are and update anything that we might throw in there. So that way kind of we'll take a step out of the process. But that's your quick tip Tuesday for today, saving your power bins, backing them up, you can do it from time to time, do it once in a while, whatever you need to do to save those power bins just in case you need them down the road, or if you crash or something happens your computer, I don't know, it melts down into a big hot molten mess, I don't know, but you've got the backup there in case you need it. That wraps up this quick Tuesday with that said I'll see you guys in the next one.
