What's going on guys welcome to the video today we're going to be hanging out and we're going to work through a little project here of Going from a horizontal video to a vertical video That's shorter that I want to use for some shorts or tiktoks So what I have already done is published a video about Airpod pros about these guys right here and how you can get the best sound possible out of these and what settings to adjust on your iPhone So what I'd like to do is take the four points I had and make those into shorter vertical videos So I was gonna do it real quick, but I figured you know what? Why don't we hang out together here? We're gonna work through this. Maybe you'll get some tips and tricks out of it and We'll see how it goes. So I haven't really done any prep for this I'm just gonna jump into the project that I already created and we're gonna go ahead and create the vertical video now There's lots of different ways we can do it, but I've got some ideas and let's just see how this works out So jump it into resolve. Let's go. So jump it into DaVinci resolve here This is the project that I did this is the full project and you can see we've got several different Markers right here with the four different points that I want to turn into vertical videos So there's lots of different ways that you can do this But what I'm gonna do is start by making a copy of this timeline So I'm gonna come to my timeline right click in my media pool. We're gonna say duplicate timeline And I'm just gonna rename it real quick We'll call this tip number one and then I want to change it to a vertical format So I'm just gonna right click on here We're gonna go timeline timeline settings gonna bring up our timeline settings window and all I want to do is click this use a Vertical resolution right here. I'm gonna go ahead and click okay. So now we're gonna go ahead and open up that timeline I'm just gonna swap timelines if you don't see that you're a multiple timelines right here You could just click on your timeline view options and right here display stacked timelines That's gonna allow you to see you know have different tabs of timelines So I could just click this drop down click on air pod pro tip number one and now we're in the new timeline So I think I want to start with right at the beginning I want this to come and come all the way up to my first tip right here So I'm just gonna select everything that's after that actually gonna make a cut right here So I want to make sure that this clip on top is cut and a drag all this or I could use Option or alt y and I'll select everything after the playhead and I'm just gonna move that down I could just select these guys grab them and move them down as well So now this is what I'm gonna be working with for this particular vertical video that I want So let's get started here and see what we've got. Let's just play through it and see how it's looking So I do want to make this a little bit bigger here. So I think what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna add a track and Let's just throw in Adjustment layer on there. So I'm gonna go to my effects go to our effects in our effects grab an adjustment clip Drop that down on there and the reason I'm adding this here is so that I can scale up the video of me without having to do All the individual clips. So now if I come on to the adjustment clip open my inspector I can scale this up to as big as I want So one of the things I like about doing it this way is that I can just scale up everything at once with the adjustment clip And then when I've got my text in areas like this, I can easily adjust it and in this case Let's say maybe I want to move this text up to the top. So I'm just gonna come to my settings We're gonna move that up make it a little bit bigger scale it up a little. All right, not too bad I think that'll work. Let's continue to play through see how it looks Out of these little air pros right now first thing pop in your AirPod pros Next you want to go ahead and grab your phone You're gonna go so right here I know that I pulled up my phone on screen and it's there, but we can't see it So what I'm gonna need to do and actually looks like I put my adjustment clip in the wrong spot So I'm gonna add another track gonna move this track up and Pull my adjustment clip down There we go, then I could delete this track right here So let's try and stay a little organized here turn off my mixer It's turn off my effects make a little more room to work here So now I can try and I don't know if this gonna work, but let's try linking all these guys together So they move together I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna right click and say link clips So now if I select one of them, hopefully they all move over together All right, they do but because of how I set up the file there. It's a it's a little weird It's not working out exactly how I want so I'm just gonna right click unlink these clips So the iPhone looks like it's in a good spot, but let's grab all of the actual screen recording from my phone and Now I'm gonna just move that over until it fits in the iPhone there. That's pretty good to me Yeah, I would say that's good enough play through a little bit of it Next you want to go ahead and grab your phone you're gonna go to settings then go down to Accessibility all right. I think that looks pretty good go through the video there. You can see the phone good Scroll through Audio setup go through the process there and set up your own custom settings. All right, so I think that's pretty good I think I think that'll work actually, you know Now the only thing to think about is do I like the way the beginning is looking here right with with me not full screen and you know You can you don't have kind of like a blurred background there. So we could just create that real quick There's a few ways that we could do that Let's go ahead and add another track actually undo that I do have a tool that might help. Let's try it here. So if I go to my effects library and I go to my effects scroll down to the bottom. I have one called R visual real buddy. So if I drop that on the clip I just see if that does anything so that's going to automatically put in some effects for us there Uh, I like that it kind of it kind of works out pretty good But I should be able to adjust a whole bunch of stuff there and for some reason I can't So I don't know why that is so I'm not going to use that But that's kind of the effect. I think that we want is that blurred background there So let me just delete that effect and maybe we could just throw something else in the background there Right. So let me add a track. I'm going to move this down and we'll put it on the bottom Let's just grab something like you could I mean we could do anything that's already pre-made here in in resolve Um, where is we got the disc wall? That's kind of cool. I like that or we could do Cosmic lines and just make it kind of you know, not too bright in the background the hexagon glow I kind of like that. So let's drop the hexagon glow in there. We're going to extend this out Maybe I want the pattern to be a little bit smaller here So let's see if we can change the scale of that change the size drop back the opacity a little bit Come back to our generator settings play with that a little Airpod pros sound pretty good, but as an audio guy here, I want them to sound even better and pull up some settings there And you do too. I'm going to show you how you can get the best sound quality All right, I'm going to put these back the decay rate intensity all these things just put them back And I'm going to boost up the c3 a little bit the animation speed And I think that's kind of cool. Let's drag it back to the very beginning here Airpod pros sound pretty good, but as an audio guy here, I want them to sound even better and you do too I'm going to show you how you can get the best sound quality out of all right Maybe I want to change my text here to be what I want to say here get better audio quality. Let's say air Pods pro better audio quality Okay, that looks good to me airpod pros Next you want to go ahead and grab your phone. You're gonna I don't know I'm still undecided on how whether I like the way that that looks or not I kind of want myself to be like full screen there. So what if I just zoomed it up? Airpod pros sound pretty good, but as an audio guy zoom it in airpod pros sound pretty good But as an audio guy here, I want them to sound even better and you do too. All right Let's get rid of the zoom in on the talking head there Airpod pros sound pretty good. So we're going to make these the same zoom scale 2.13. I'm looking up here in my inspector Up here 2.13 Looks good. May as scoot it over just a little bit that way 31 we're gonna do that to the same first clip minus 31. So it looks the same See how that looks Airpod pros sound pretty good, but as an audio guy here, I want them to sound even better and you do too I'm gonna see if we move our text up a little bit here Kind of get it off my head just a touch. Uh move it up Up that's the wrong thing make sure I got the right thing selected text up just a little A little bit bigger. It's pretty good. Make sure we got our shadow controls on and in case you guys were wondering This title here is actually a whip title jake whip. He's got awesome templates and all that stuff. I use them all the time Um, so I'm just gonna come in here. We're gonna crank up my shadow You can change the softness a little bit there if we want boom looks good Go with that. All right, and this last one. I'm actually gonna copy and Paste the same setting. So I'm just gonna come to my clip control c or command c option or alt v Get our box. We want to paste our attributes. I want to paste all of them. Boom Here's what it looks like First thing popping your airpod pros Next all right, where is that zoom coming from? So that's a dynamic zoom I had on there. I'm gonna turn that off popping your airpod pros Next you want to go. All right, so now we're looking at the phone and we're actually going through the phone setting So I don't need to see me in here anymore. So I'm gonna come to all of these clips of me And make sure we're just on the phone for all of them. Yep looks like it and I'm just gonna Turn off the portions of me. So I'm gonna select those clips. I'm gonna change the opacity to zero And then I want to drag out the hexagon there So we got that in the background because I think it's kind of cool. So we're gonna leave that there boom and that's pretty much it I think that's uh, all I'm gonna really be doing here because then we'll look at the phone as I go through the settings And then is there anything I want to put at the end or maybe just leave it as nothing I don't know. Let's see. Let's see what I said at the end So that is four different ways you can take your airpod pros here and get better quality audio out of them Now there are some other headphones that are better that I'll talk about in another video if you want to learn how to edit your audio I'm actually divin you can check out some of my videos on how to edit Hey, maybe I'll throw in this part right if I want to if you want to learn how to edit your audio So let's come back here. I'm just gonna select all that. Oh, that was selected. All right. I'm gonna Commander control c we're gonna bring this back I'm just gonna pop this on at the end. We're already over a minute anyway So I don't even know if that matters for shorts and all that anymore. Anyway, so commander control v Uh, not paste attributes. Sorry commander control v not alt And then I'm gonna just bring these guys back. So let's see how that looks So if I play through what do we get here through the process there and set up your own custom settings If you want to learn how to edit your audio, I'm actually a DaVinci resolve audio guy So I do have a logo. Oh, there we go certified trainer Bring that in Put that right about there. Let's see how that looks if you want to learn how to edit your audio I'm actually we're gonna zoom in myself here I'm gonna move up the DaVinci resolve logo a little bit Just kind of talking through it telling you guys what I'm doing here Hopefully you're not too bored yet and then on this clip and this clip actually Let's see. I want to actually throw on some blanking fill. So I'm going to come over to my effects library open effects Let's come on down to where are you? Where are you? Blanking fill drop that on there and that's going to blur out the background for me And uh, that's going to work out just great. That's how I like that zoom that We don't want to Oh, do we want to I guess I could leave the crop at zero. That's fine. I want to do zoom to timeline Oh, actually, I want to change this crop in because it would cut off the sides a little here Which is annoying and I don't want to do that. Uh, let's see. We can add in a little drop shadow there. Sure I don't want to blend the edges blur the background. I can blur that some more if I want I can Fade it back, but maybe I'll change the color to black just to kind of make it a little darker there And uh, let's play see what we got your own custom settings If you want to learn how to edit your audio I'm actually DaVinci resolve audio guy You can check out some of my videos on how to edit your own audio to make it sound the best you can With that said, I will see you in the next video. Peace All right, so let's just scale some of this down a little bit I want to use the same settings from this clip commander control c and this clip Option or alt v paste my attributes. I get my paste attributes window apply And now that should look the same good good. Okay, and then I've got my stick man here He starts walking over. So let me move him over on to Start walking on the screen here drag him over a little more So he's just starting to come on screen. Where is he? Oh I will see you. Where are you at boy? There he is All right, and then our subscribe here Let's shrink this down. Actually, let's just do something a little different here. Let's rotate this bad boy Pull it down Subscribe just leave it at that. Why not? Why not? I know this is just experimenting. I'm just trying stuff, you know I mean who knows some settings if you want to learn how to edit your audio I'm actually DaVinci resolve audio guy You can check out some of my videos on how to edit your own audio to make it sound the best you can With that said, I will see you in the next video. Peace All right, that's it I think I'm just going to drag out the hexagon glow because why not so that once I disappear You get the oh hexagon glow under there. So right here. I'm just going to make a little cut Scale this up a little bit. All right, never mind on the on the hexagon go change my mind on that So I think we'll just leave this as it is. So that looks good enough to me So now we're going to go ahead and render this particular one out or at least set up the render settings Then maybe I'll make all of them and then render them all out at once. So I'm just going to set an out point here So that way we've got this portion of our timeline I don't need to do any audio work because I just copied the timeline. Everything is already there color grades already there Everything's good to go. So let's go ahead and jump into The deliver tab. I'm going to get a sip of coffee. You should always have some coffee while you're doing some editing because um, I don't know. It's just something nice to have Ah, let me some coffee. All right in the deliver page here I'm going to go to 1080 export for youtube, which is a preset that I have you can kind of see what I got here I'm going to select a location to save this and then looking down I'm going to leave all this as it is. You can see I use an mp4 h 264 by 1080 vertical resolution And everything else I leave the same I did change quality to 4000 That's just typically what I use and say add to the render queue here. I don't know why up here Oh, maybe it's just not seeing all the layers together. I'm not sure why it's a little odd how it looks up here I'm not sure why that is but let's just go ahead and render it and we'll just double check that real quick So I'm go ahead and hit render and they're going to wait and have a little bit more coffee And then we're going to go work on the other ones right in the same timeline since we've already got that set It should be fairly easy and fairly quick. So that render looks like it'll be all right I think and let's just move on to making the next one. So the next one here The apple music method here is pretty short So what I'm going to do is come over here. We're just going to make a cut Select my couple of pieces here bring it back and I think I'm going to grab the same intro You know, I'm just going to kind of stack it all up in the same timeline here because I don't know why not All right, we're just trying to do this quick and easy So if I come in and I grab my first uh bunch of clips here Just going to copy them just going to window them all down Commander control c paste insert I'm just going to drag these back Into place got our beginning Which I know is okay. I forget to copy one clip right there looks like I did So we're just going to grab this guy option or alt click hold and drag to copy it over boom drop it in there What's up with this hexagon glow something's out of whack with that? No, that looks weird. So I'm just going to come back to generators and grab another hexagon glow and drop that in there Because I don't know what's going on with that Pull that out a little bit See where's our scale at scale it down like that looks pretty good zoom it in Looks like we've got a little space here in the timeline. So I'm just going to click that gap hit delete See what we got The second method here to make that audio sound even better again grab your phone go to set So right here I want to make a cut because I want to bring in the phone. So I'm going to bring this over here Bring it over the phone I'm going to grab my two clips of the actual screen recording of the phone We're going to bring them over drop it on in there Looks pretty good. And then in this case, I'm actually going to make a cut on the clip of me so I could fade that out Disable that I don't think I'm I need to be in it anywhere else here Disable this one or not disable actually I don't want to disable because then I lose my audio too So I actually want to come here and drop the opacity I forgot to scale my window right. So now my window scaled right come to my next clip drop the opacity Make a little more space on the screen here Click on music and you can come down here to the audio section and click on the e-mail sound even better Get grab your phone go to settings Scroll down to apps at the bottom if you use apple music This is for you scroll down to music click on music and you can come down here to the audio section and click section on the EQ and you can choose the eq that works best for you or that you think sounds the best for me personally I like rock that's going to boost the low ends a little bit for you the bass and low ends It's going to increase the high end just a little bit and it's maybe cause a little drop in the mid-range there So that's the kind of sound that I like to go for but try these out see what you like you can play through your music And these are going to make a difference in helping these guys sound better. All right now Let's see if I can grab the closing from the first one Uh right here. So I'm just going to copy this Copy bring it to the end of my timeline here or my second video paste Bring it back. Let's just see what this looks like here And these are going to make a difference in helping these guys to ventures of audio guy you can check out some of my videos I'm going to adjust myself on the screen here a little bit. I know why that's different than the first one Let me come back here take a look. Yeah, that's fine there. I don't know. I don't know why that was different Oh, and I copied over the hexagon glow. So let me just go ahead and we're going to undo that real quick Redo, let's come up here select our last few clips, but I don't want the hexagon glow copy that come over here Paste and we'll just drag this back. There we go zoom back in here. See how it's looking the eq that works best for you Or that you think sounds the best for me personally I like that's going to boost the low ends a little bit for you the base and low ends It's going to increase the high end just a little bit if you want to learn how to edit your audio I'm actually a DaVinci resolve audio guy. You could check it. There we go. Drag that back Guy you could check out some of my videos on how to edit your own audio to make it sound the best you can With that said, I will see you in the next video. Peace I changed this to add that's changed that to normal. That's normal And I don't want the Hex in there. I will see you in the next video. Peace There we go I think that works out pretty good I'm happy with that. What do you guys think? I think that'll work And I'm just going to go ahead and redo the same process for the other two videos here So you get the idea of kind of how I'm working through it. I just a fun little project I didn't plan it. I'm just going through it and thinking, you know off top of my head. How are we going to do these things? But hopefully you guys got some good tips and tricks there on how to do these things and then you know You could create different timelines. There's a whole bunch of different ways that you could do it I just figured I'd sit down real quick throw on the camera And then you guys can work along with me here and see what I'm doing what I'm thinking and why so I don't know. Did you guys find this kind of video helpful? Do you want to see more things like this where I just work through the project? You can see my process see how it works out and just see what I'm doing and and why and I'll just kind of talk through What I'm thinking. I don't know is that helpful for you guys? Let me know because if you are I mean I'm happy to make more videos like this and Yeah, so that's about wraps up this one with that said going to drink some more coffee here finish up these two edits Post them out on the shorts at a tiktok sort of whatever's and with that said I will see you guys in the next video. Peace You
