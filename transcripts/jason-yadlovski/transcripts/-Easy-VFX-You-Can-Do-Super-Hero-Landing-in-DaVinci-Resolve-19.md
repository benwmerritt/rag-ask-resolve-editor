Today I'm showing you exactly how to create this cool superhero landing. You can download the files to follow along, I'll leave a link in the description below, head on over to my shop 5, pick them up, they're gonna be free, and then you can try and create this cool superhero landing too. Let's jump into Resolve. Jumping into Resolve here, if you downloaded the file that I provided for you in the link in the description, you're gonna be able to follow along and do exactly what we're gonna do in this video. So you should have MVI 1300, you can go ahead and drop that into the timeline, and we're ready to get started. So if you take a look at this clip here, what we have, it's me walking into frame, I jump right there, I land, I blow the leaves, and I walk out of frame. So when you're trying to create an effect like this, two things you gotta keep in mind, one, you need like a clean background, a clean plate is what I'm gonna call it. And then you need to have you doing whatever it is you wanna do, in this case me doing the superhero landing. So the first thing we wanna do is get that clean background. So in my video clip, after I walk out of frame here, we've got a clean background. So I'm gonna go ahead and just make a cut on this background here. I'm gonna drag this over to the side, and this is where we're gonna start to build out our little sequence of our superhero landing. The next thing that I need to do is find a part where I wanna make myself look like I'm falling into the frame. And where I want that to happen is where I jump. So I'm gonna come back here and where I'm at the highest point of my jump. So I'm just gonna go up, up, use my arrows just to get to that exact spot. Let's say I wanna go right there. So once I find the spot where I'm at the highest point of my jump, I wanna go ahead and make a cut. And now I wanna take our clip and I just wanna make a copy of it. So I'm gonna use Option or Alt, click Hold and drag and copy up my clip. The next thing that I need to do is create a still out of this particular frame in our video clip. So this is why we made a copy and put it on top of our original clip. So I'm gonna select my clip, come up to the clip menu and choose Freeze Frame. So now this is a freeze frame. I can extend it out or make it as long or as short as I want. And it's just a freeze frame. So we're gonna use this to create our superhero falling out of the sky and then landing. Now it's important that we keep this lined up kind of where it is and the reason that we made the cut because after our superhero lands, that's where we want the video to pick up, right? So it looks like it was just all a video and not actually a freeze frame. So it's a little bit of movie magic here that we're gonna create. So for now, I'm just gonna drag over my freeze frame and bring it over here because what we need to do next is isolate the subject, me, so that we can animate it and make it look like I'm falling out of the sky. So in order to do that, bring my playhead to the beginning of the clip here. We're gonna jump over into the Color tab. Now you can do this in the Color tab or in Fusion. It's up to you, it doesn't matter. I did it in the Color tab, but Fusion is perfectly fine too. So the first thing we need to do is select our subject, which is me. Now there's a bunch of different ways that you can do it. If you have Studio, the easiest and quickest way is gonna be to use the magic masks right here. And that's the way that I'm gonna do it. But you can rotoscope and trace over, you know, your subject and do it that way too. If you have the free version, it just takes a little bit longer. So magic mask, gonna choose my little plus button here. I want to use a better outline. I'm just gonna zoom in here and I'm gonna draw a few lines to select my subject. Try and be careful here. Grab my boots, pants. Once I made my selection, I'm gonna go ahead and hit the track forward and backward button. And even though it's a still, you still want to hit your track forward and backward. So now I've got my track that's complete. Now we need to create an alpha output. And to do that, we're actually gonna hook up our blue box here to an alpha output. So we're gonna right click in this area of our nodes and say add alpha output. And before I connect these up, I actually want to add in another node. So I'm just gonna select this guy, use Option or Alt S to add in another node. And then I'm just gonna connect up my blue boxes here. So that way we've got just me as an alpha channel. So I'm on a transparent background now. And you can come down in here in our magic mask tools and refine the edges a little bit if you want to. In this case, the way we're building this, it's not too necessary to go too crazy with it, because we're actually gonna blur the edges next. Because as I fall down into the frame, we want it to look a little blurred, like there's some, you know, motion blurred to it, like I'm speeding through the air and falling down into the scene. So in order to create that, you want to open up your effects library. And we want to take our directional blur right here and just drop it onto your next node. Now we can see I've got the little bit of blur going on, I'm gonna adjust the angle, we're just gonna say minus 90. So it's up and down because I'm gonna fall through the scene there. And we've got our alpha output hooked up. So we're good to go. This is exactly what we need to create me falling into the scene as a superhero. So now we're gonna jump back into the edit tab. And the next thing we want to do is go back and grab part of our original scene, our original video clip, where I go from the point that we just made that freeze frame down to land and then the rest of the video. So we can see right here. And this is why we made a cut at that specific point, because now what I want to do is just take that part where I made the cut, bring it to the end of my freeze frame. And once we create the freeze frame, it's gonna look like, boom, I land. Now you might notice, okay, well, we just have the cut out of you, but it doesn't look like you're coming into the background, right? And that's why we need the clean plate of the background, right? Which is this part right here. So I'm just gonna grab a little piece of this, I'm gonna bring it over and put it underneath the cut out of me. So now we've got the background and we've got me floating there. And this is the basic start to how we're gonna make me falling into the scene. So the next thing we need to do is just animate our freeze frame so that it looks like I come from the top of the frame, boom, and drop down into our background. So to do that, I'm just gonna use some simple keyframes right here in the edit page to be able to create that effect. So I'm gonna select my freeze frame, make sure you got your inspector open, just go ahead and click on our keyframes here for our transform section. And now I just want to bring myself up off of frame. Bring myself up. So right there I'm about 425 on the Y. Now I'm gonna move ahead a few frames here. I'm gonna say 10 frames, but we can always change this after the fact, it's not a big deal. So I did about 10 keyframes here and we can see maybe it's a little slow, but that's okay, cause we can always speed it up. Now if you wanted to see your keyframes, you can just click on the little diamond here, and we could just click hold and drag this back, right, and move around our keyframe there for our Y position if we wanted to. So I could fall in quicker, and you could just adjust it however you want. So let's just slide this back. Let's say this looks pretty good for right now and just start with this in this spot right here. So now that we have me falling in from the sky, we need to line this up with the actual video clip of me landing and then starting to blow the leaves. So I have it right here. So I'm just gonna slide my little clip up a little bit here. And now we have the clean background, and then we're gonna have me flying through the scene, and then it's gonna turn into the real video, and then I'm gonna land. So let's just play through that. Here's what it looks like. So it's pretty good. Now you see that some leaves do appear there. So we could always try and grab a clean plate from earlier in the frame. So it doesn't matter. We only need a little bit. So I could start from the beginning here and come to maybe here. Gonna make a cut. Gonna bring this over, get rid of that clean frame, and we're just gonna put this clean frame in just so that way the leaves look the same as I'm landing. You don't see them kind of show up in the frame, right, after I've already actually blown them off. So here's what that would look like. And that looks a whole lot better, right? It's me landing, coming in, boom, landing, and starting to blow the leaves. Now you can adjust the speed of me falling in if you want to. You probably want to try and match it up with this a little bit, maybe. Maybe you do, maybe you don't. But you get the idea, you kind of tweak it until you like the way that it's looking. Now a couple other things that I did add in. I added in a bunch of smoke coming in. So if I go to my media pool, I didn't provide these for you guys only because it's, you know, it's not royalty-free stuff. I had to pay for it, so I can't just pass it along. But if I have a little dust cloud right here, I'm gonna come and bring this over. We're gonna put that on top. And right before my feet touch the ground, or right when my feet touch the ground, that's where I want the dust to start. So I'm gonna just drag my dust clip. We'll put it maybe like that. I'm gonna lower it down in the frame. We're gonna make it bigger, just using our inspector. Bring it back up, kind of like that. So when we land, boom, there we go. We've got nice, dusty landing there. So if you're in New Jersey, it hasn't rained in forever, although it did rain a little bit last night, but it hasn't rained in like two months. So we're gonna just back down our landing dust there. And you can keep it. It's all however you want it to look, right? Maybe I want to fade it out, you know, by this point. Kind of like this. Boom, I land. It fades out. Probably needs to be longer than that. Boom. You can also change the blend mode of these overlay kind of things using the composite area here. You can do add, color, multiply, you know, you depend. It just depends on how you want it to look. You can create, you know, whatever kind of look you might want for your particular video. Maybe extend it out a little more, but there you go. You get the gist of the superhero landing. Now what are the rest of the things that really help sell this? Once you've created this basic sequence here of you coming down in the frame and landing, you start to add in your other things. So if I just jump back to my original here, I'm gonna show you the kinds of things that I added in. So we have me coming down into the frame. We have me landing. I did add an adjustment clip where I put a little bit of camera shake in there, right? Because if there's a big, you know, hardcore landing, it's probably gonna shake the camera a little bit. So in order to do that, I'll show you how we can create that. If I just come to my effects library, we're gonna come to our open effects, sorry, our effects, grab an adjustment clip here. We're gonna put it on top of all of our clips. And actually I want it to start right where I land. So right about, let's say there, gonna drag the beginning of my adjustment clip to there. Now I want to go to my open effects and I'm gonna grab some camera shake right here. We're gonna drop that on. Now if I play through it, you'll see it just kind of keeps going for a little bit there. Not necessarily what I want. So I'm gonna shorten up this adjustment clip here. Just drag it on back a little. Now you notice it does kind of zoom in a little bit. So what I did is I actually key frame this. So I just started with, you know, the default settings here. I put two key frames in, in my inspector. And I think I did speed it up just a little bit maybe, let's see. Yeah, maybe a little bit. Oh, come back here. Let's just undo that last key frame. Sped it up a little bit, a little extra on the motion scale. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, let's say eight frames. And then I just drag these down to zero so that it stops. And here's what that looks like. All right, might be a little quick so we can always come in here. We can adjust it if we want to. But you get the idea of how we're kind of starting to put this together. So if we jump back to the original here, you can see I land, it does a little shake. And it just helps sell the effect of a superhero landing. Another thing that I added was an adjustment clip on top of everything. And I added in the film look creator just to kind of add some cool, you know, visual interest to it, right? So if I turn this off, you can see we don't have the black bars. It doesn't look a cinematic color is just kind of normal. Right. So I use the film look creator made some minor adjustments in there just to kind of make it look a little more cinematic and a little bit cooler. So I thought anyway, that's up to you on how you want to color grade it and how you want your video or that particular scene to come across. But the last thing that you want to do is to start to add in some of those sound effects. What's really going to help sell this whole effect for you. So if I just show you the sound effects that I added in, I do have some music that's playing underneath everything I added in some earthy sound effects. Woosh, we have explosions just to kind of help sell the effect. And I do have one, two, three, four, five, six, six sound effects on this one little clip here. And I have the music track that's going along. So here's what it all looks like and sounds like. So I think the sound effects really help sell the whole little scene there, me falling in. You heard some rocks break in, even though there's no rocks in the scene. It helps sell the whole idea of what's happening here in our little scene. So that is it in a nutshell superhero landing. It's not that hard. It's actually pretty easy to create here in resolve. If you created it using these files or using your own files, let me see what you got. Drop a link down below. Let me know where I can see the stuff that you guys are working on. So I can check it out and just kind of see the cool stuff that you guys are creating. If you have questions as always, leave a comment down below. And with that said, I'm off to make some more cool stuff for you guys. So I will see you in the next video. Peace.
