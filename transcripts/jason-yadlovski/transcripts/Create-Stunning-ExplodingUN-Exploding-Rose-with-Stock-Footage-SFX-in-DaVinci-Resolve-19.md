What'd you think of that little sequence? Kinda cool, right? Well today I'm going to show you exactly how to create that IndiVenture Resolve. It's actually pretty easy. Let's jump into Resolve, check it out. IndiVenture Resolve here, I'm in the Edit tab and I already have all of the assets that I want to use in my media pool. I downloaded the flower exploding and you can see right here it just explodes, it doesn't go back together like you saw in the first little clip there of our video. So first thing I need to do is take this red rose exploding and drop it in my timeline. Now I do my other sound effects and things but we're going to get to them in a second. The first thing I want to do is get the visual right. I want to see that rose explode and then go back together. So to do that we're going to just make a cut and then reverse part of our clip. So if I look through the beginning of our clip it explodes and it comes out to maybe here. So let's make a cut right there. I'm going to drag this over because now as the clip gets reversed we're going to want that point right here to match up with it exploding so that it looks like it stops at that point and goes back together. And here's how I would do that. I'm going to drag this clip over, I'm going to make a copy of my first clip so I know how long I need this one to be. I'm going to actually reverse this clip right here and you can do it by selecting the clip, opening your inspector, go to change speed and you can click on the little reverse icon and now the clip is going to play backwards so that's what's going to make it look like it's all coming back together. I'm going to close my inspector for now and just a little bonus tip here, another way that you can reverse the clip is to right click, go to change clip speed and you can reverse clip right there. So you've got options like resolve, you can always do things many different ways. Now I know this bottom clip I wanted to match up right here right with the rows so I'm going to make sure my clips all the way extended out and I'm going to bring this back here and now all I have to do is shorten up my clip. So in theory now this point right here when this clip is going backwards should match this clip right here. So let's just slide these together here and then we're going to see if it looks like they match up and yeah that looks perfect. Now you can add a freeze frame in the middle if you want in this case I'm not going to but I'm just going to go ahead and delete my little reference clip there because I don't need that. But now we've got our rows, it's going to explode, it's going to go out to the point that we picked there to make the cut and then it's going to start to come back together until we have the entire rows and boom it's all back together. Before we add in our sound effects here to really help sell this little sequence I want to take a minute and thank the sponsor for today's video and that is Motion Array. I've been a member at Motion Array for a long time they actually have some free assets that you guys can jump on there, try out, see if it's something that you might be interested in but having access to assets like Motion Array has including stock footage, motion graphics, music, sound effects, photos, graphics, it really just gives you an opportunity to create things that you might not otherwise be able to if you didn't have access to create these assets on your own and let's be honest most of us can't create a lot of this stuff on our own but I really enjoy jumping on Motion Array, finding some different types of footage templates or something and then creating something new here in DaVinci Resolve. It helps me learn and it just gives me the opportunity to work with cool assets that I probably wouldn't be able to work with otherwise. And the video footage that we have of the exploding rows here as well as all of the sound effects and a little bit of music all came from Motion Array. I'd encourage you to jump on there check it out if you're looking for a one-stop shop for all kinds of great video assets that you can use to make your videos awesome. Check out Motion Array, I'll leave a link down in the description below if you're interested. So we have our video all set up I like how this is looking so far so let's start to add in some of our effects. So I know I want the explosion sound to happen when the rows explodes right? I think that makes a lot of sense. So we have bomb explosion here this is what it sounds like. Perfect so let's bring that down into the timeline. I'm just going to use my playhead and find the spot where the rows starts to explode. Right about there looks good so I'm going to zoom in my timeline a little bit and I'm going to put my explosion right there. Now you can name your audio tracks explode. There we go so now we should have a low explosion for our rows. A little sound effect there let's see. All right that works pretty good we can make minor adjustments as we go along here if we want. Now the next thing that I want to do is add in a little beeps for the countdown to kind of come in like a three two one right? We're not going to have any spoken word here but the beeps I think could work out pretty good so we're just really literally going to add three beeps here. So I'm going to press O for an out point drag this down into a new track bring it all the way back to the beginning and let's just see how that sounds. I'm going to drop the volume down just a little bit. So that's a little close there right? I think I want a little more space between the explosion and the beep so I'm just going to select these three and use my period key to bump them over a few frames. All right I think that looks pretty good I'm going to fade the rows in here a little bit just to make it look a little bit better I think and this is what it's looking like. All right I like that I think that works out pretty good so what else do we want to add in here? We have a breaking rock here's what that sounds like. Now I like the sound of that because it sounds like things and pieces falling right? So let's bring that down into our timeline and I actually want that to line up or be pretty close to where we have the rows exploding. I'm actually going to move the sound effect up a little bit I think it's could go like right there maybe so I'm going to bring this one back here now the part that I really want is the ending of this clip not so much the beginning so I'm going to add in a couple of keyframes here just to kind of lower the beginning because we already have an explosion sound so I don't really need two of them so I'm just going to add a few keyframes there make the beginning a little quieter it's okay if we still have it and then I'm going to make the ending a little bit louder let's see how that sounds all right I'm actually even going to shorten the clip up bring it back a little bit extend out my keyframe there and I think it's a little on the loud side so I'm going to drop it back just a little bit there all right let's give it a little listen here from the beginning all right a little bit quieter there on the rock break now let's see what else we have here we have a transform sound that I just thought might be kind of interesting as the rows comes back together right it's kind of like transforming sounds like a transformer right I love me some transformers so let's drag and drop that down into the timeline and I'm gonna have to lower the volume down on that and where do we want to put that well I kind of want it to happen before right before maybe the rose starts coming back together so it starts to come back together right here so if I zoom in a little bit this clip kind of starts there let's just kind of see how that sounds all right not too bad but one thing that I do notice is that as the rose comes back together I want it to kind of start out slow and then go faster as it gets put back together here so we can do that with some simple retiming and to do that let me zoom in a little here we can select our clip we can press command or control r that's going to bring up our retime controls now I want to move the playhead to the point where I want it to start to speed up so maybe like right there looks good I'm gonna click on this little arrow here and say add speed point and for the second half I want to speed it up a little bit so let's maybe make this I don't know 150% let's just see what that looks like all right not too bad I think that's okay so now we might want to smoothen out that transition a little bit now it's not too noticeable here but it's an important tip here to keep in mind that you can do this is select the clip again right click and we want to come down to retime curve so you'll see the retime curve come up here so now I am on the retime speed right here which is the one that we want to take a look at and I've got my one point right here now if you need to zoom this up because it's hard to see you can actually come over to this 300% here and zoom it this way so that way it gets a little bigger for you kind of see what you're looking at a little bit easier but I'm going to select the speed point or the key frame right here and I'm just going to click on this option right there which gives it a nice smoothed out look so it'll ease into that speed up instead of just boom go right into speeding up faster I close that up and that should be good to go for that so let's just zoom out a little here let's take a look at the whole thing see how it's coming together we'll go one viewer here all right so with our effect that sounds like a transformation we can actually cut this once the rose gets back together so let's just call it right here and make a cut and delete this part fade it out a little bit and actually maybe just extend it a little a little fade on there now the other thing that I want to do is I want it to sound like it's coming back together a little bit more and one way that I can do that is to use our explosion effect and reverse that so I'm going to just bring this back to where our clip starts to reverse going to make a copy of this clip holding alt or option on a Mac going to select my clip right change clip speed reverse speed there we go and so now our clip is going to play in reverse going to bring it together and I want to make sure that when the rose is done coming together that's where the end of my sound is so I'm going to shrink this down a little bit bring it this way line it up the best I can and then I can extend the clip back out and you could put a crossfade on these if you wanted to I don't know that's necessary in this case but let's just see how it sounds now all right so we are getting there this is kind of exactly the effect that I'm going for so now let's go ahead and add in our little bit of background music there so I've got a new track here audio five and you should label all your tracks so you can keep track of everything real easily you know what's what but let's grab our song here explore together short two put this in here and let's just see how it sounds I'm going to drop the volume of it because I mostly want to hear the sound effect so I'm going to bring this down let's say minus 16 see how that sounds to see how that sounds to start with let's play through all right that's not too bad I think that's all right so a couple things I want to do I might want to lower the music just a little bit maybe just a little bit more another thing I want to do is fade out my rows I want it to fade out at the end so add a little fade in there then I also want my music to kind of fade out too so I'm going to make a cut delete the last half of my music there and I actually want it to get a little bit louder at the end there I think that could be kind of cool so as the rose comes together right there I want the music to be a little bit louder so I'm just going to hold option or alt click on the gain line down here and add in a few keyframes boost up my volume a little bit and then I'm going to add a fade out I may even need to extend this a little bit so the fade could be a little bit longer and let's just see how that's sounding music all right not bad now I do need to check out my levels right make sure none of my clips are too loud maybe these booms are a little loud you know I could bring them back just a wee little bit make sure that nothing's peeking over bring them back like a db or a little less and I'm just going to watch my meters here make sure that nothing's peeking and then it looks pretty good maybe we move our fade in a little bit for the music so it's not as drawn out all right I think that'll work and there you go we have an awesome little sequence there a little bit of sound effects one clip that we're able to reverse blowing up the rose bringing it back together a little bit of music in there a couple sound effects and I think we've got something that looks pretty cool what do you guys think did you learn a little something in this video do you have questions on this process leave it down below I'm happy to answer your questions and again a big thank you to motion ray for sponsoring today's video and the reason I love services like motion ray is just because I can't create everything myself and a place like motion ray gives me the opportunity to use some awesome high quality assets to make cool stuff here and resolve and just try things and make things like this exploding rose so if you guys are interested in that I'll leave a link down in the description below you can check that out too and with that said that wraps up this one I look forward to seeing you in the next video peace
