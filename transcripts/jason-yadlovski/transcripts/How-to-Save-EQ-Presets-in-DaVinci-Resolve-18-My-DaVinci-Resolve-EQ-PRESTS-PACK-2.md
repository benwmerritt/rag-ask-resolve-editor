Wooo buddy excited for the video today because I am releasing my EQ presets pack number two. Super excited about it. So we're going to talk about that. I'm going to show you what they sound like and what the EQs look like so you can see if it's something you might be interested in. But before you go anywhere, I am going to show you how to create your own EQ preset as well in DaVinci Resolve because maybe you know how to work with the EQ and you just don't know how to save a preset. I'm going to show you how to do that and you might want to stick around and sign up for the contest that I'm running in the description below because I'm going to give away five of my EQ preset packs. So I'm going to combine pack number one and pack number two and five of you guys are going to win those EQ presets so you can try them out, see what you think and hopefully they help your audio sound better and more professional. Now real quick covering the cost for my 15 EQ presets here up front is going to be 15 bucks for the 15 EQ presets. On my pack number one I'm actually going to slash the price. They were 35 bucks for, I forget, I got 20 something in there, I forget I have to look that up. I'm going to slash the price on that. They're going to be 20 bucks and I'm going to have a combo deal. You want to get pack number one and pack number two. We're going to put them together and it's only going to cost you 25 bucks and if you decide to pick any of them up I really do appreciate the support for my channel. All right let's jump into Resolve and I'm going to show you how to create your own EQ preset and then we'll jump into talking more about my EQ presets. All right jumping into Resolve here is how you create your own EQ preset. So make sure you're in Fairlight, the little musical notes here at the bottom, click on that. You want to make sure that your mixer is open. So mixer is right up here at the top. You want to click on that, make sure that's open. Next you want to come down to your EQ and the first thing you want to do is double click your EQ, open it up and you want to go ahead and make some changes. Let's turn it on there. Let's say I make some changes here. I'm going to just go like this, whatever, you know, just make some changes. I'm going to drop this down here. Let's say I want to boost a little presence but dial back the high end. Okay there we go. Let's say I like that and I want to save that as an EQ preset. Very easy. Just come on up to the Fairlight menu at the top here. Come on down to preset library. That's going to open up this window right here. You want to make sure that under Filter By it's going to have EQ presets or equalizer presets. Make sure that's selected. The next thing you need to do is select the track where you want to save your EQ. So what track did you create your EQ on? In this case it was track one and I'm going to come down here and save new. Once you do that it's going to pop up this window. I'm going to say create new. And it's going to pop up this window and ask you to name the preset that you're creating. I'm going to call it how to create your own preset. Once you've got your name in there go ahead and click okay. Boom that's it. Now it's done. So if you come over here and you look in your EQ preset list, boom there it is. If I want to apply it to a track, I only got one track here but let me add in a track. Boom. All right let's say I want to apply this EQ to track number two. I'm going to click on the preset I want to apply. I'm going to click on the track. I want to apply it to and then I'm going to go ahead and hit apply. And now if you come over here in your mixer and you look at this little area right here, you can see that EQ preset has been applied. So let's get into my EQ preset pack number two here. So with this pack I really wanted to target specific areas of the EQ because in general I find that it's the same kind of frequency ranges and spots where you find issues with most audio. So this pack kind of targets some of those areas. Now the best way that we can talk about it is I'm just going to roll some tape here show you some examples. You can listen in, put on some headphones if you got them because that's going to be the best way to hear the differences. Let me know what you think. Can you hear the difference? We're going to start with some raw audio and go through all these presets and I want to hear what you think. Comment down below. Can you hear difference in these presets? All right let's go ahead and roll that tape. Listen to these EQ presets. What you're listening to now is raw audio recorded into the Samsung G-Track Pro. This microphone is not too expensive about 130 bucks give or take a little bit but this is what it sounds like with no EQ applied. Now let's get into what the EQ preset sound like that I created. The first EQ preset here is the bass boost preset and here is what it sounds like when we apply the bass boost preset. The next preset we have here is the bass tune up number one. So this is what it sounds like when we use the bass tune up number one preset on our voice. Next we have the bass so this is what it sounds like when we apply the bass tune up number three on to our voice and this is what that EQ preset sounds like. Sometimes in your recordings it sounds a little thin, so this next preset is called Boost Thin Sounds, and this is gonna help boost up those thin sounds that you might have in your microphone. This is what that EQ preset sounds like. Maybe you wanna add a little brightness into your audio. This EQ preset called Brightness is gonna add some brightness or a little bit of clarity to your audio. The next preset we have here is Darker. It's gonna add some low end in there, and it's gonna help your vocal sound a little bit darker, a little bit richer, and this is what the darker EQ preset sounds like. This next EQ preset is a general refresh preset called General Refresh, and it's just gonna kinda tune up your audio a little bit there using this EQ preset, and this is what it's gonna sound like. The next preset we have is called High Cut, and this is gonna cut out some of those higher frequencies for you and kinda target that high frequency area, cut those out a little bit, and hopefully get rid of some of those high frequency things that you don't wanna hear, and this is what that EQ preset sounds like. This next EQ preset is a low and high boost and a mid cut, so we're gonna boost the high and the low ends, we're gonna cut the mid, and this is what that EQ preset sounds like. Boosting the lows is gonna give you a little more bass and low end, boosting the highs is gonna give you a little bit more clarity, and reducing the middles kinda gets rid of some of the muddiness for you, and this is what that EQ preset sounds like. Presence, if you wanna bring a little more presence into the voice, we have a Presence EQ preset, and this is what that's gonna sound like. Again, the Presence EQ preset. Next EQ preset here is called Vocal Low Cut, and what we want this to do is get rid of some of the rumbling and those lower end frequencies that we don't want in our audio, cause it's just gonna make it muddy and make it not as clear. So this EQ preset is called Vocal Low End. The next EQ preset here is called Rumble Cleanup, and this is essentially a high pass filter at about 160 hertz, this is gonna get rid of some of that low end rumble, that's just gonna make your audio sound muddy. The next EQ preset here is called Vocal Cleanup, and this is gonna apply a cut in certain key areas where you generally find some issues with your vocals. So this EQ preset is called Vocal Cleanup. And the final preset here is called Warm Vocal, this is gonna warm up and make the vocal sound a little bit richer. This is what that EQ preset sounds like on my voice. Again, it's called Warm Vocal. Back to audio with no EQ applied to it. This is what it sounds like here on the Samsung G-Track Pro. Fantastic microphone right here, by the way, if you're looking for a desktop microphone that sounds great and can do a great job for you. Got a review on it if you wanna check it out. So that is my 15 new EQ presets here. Again, you can pick them up for 15 bucks, link in the description below, or you can go pick up pack number one, again, I'm slashing the price on that down to 20 bucks. And if you wanna pick both of them up, you can go ahead and pick them both up for 25 bucks. We got a little bundle deal, all of them are linked down in the description below.
