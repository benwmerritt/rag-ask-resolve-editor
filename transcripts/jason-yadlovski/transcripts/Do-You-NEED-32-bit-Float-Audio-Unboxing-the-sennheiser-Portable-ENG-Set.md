What is happening guys, it is time for a little unboxing. So you may be familiar with or have heard of 32-bit float audio. You might not know what that means, but essentially it means that you're going to be able to record your audio without having to worry too much about your audio levels. You're going to have a wider dynamic range of audio to work with once you get it into DaVinci Resolve. And I've been kind of looking into it a little bit, been looking around for microphones or recording systems that record in 32-bit float because most of the stuff that you've already got does not record in 32-bit float. So I reached out to my friends over at Sennheiser and my buddy Zach over there, I said, hey, I'm looking to make some stuff about 32-bit float. What do you guys got that I could use to make videos for you guys out there so we understand what 32-bit float is, how it works, how we can edit it and all that fun stuff when it comes to working with it in DaVinci Resolve. So Zach was kind enough to send out a little package here and we're going to open this up and I'm going to show you what we're going to be using here that records in 32-bit float audio. So we're going to unbox this guy, check this out. Made this knife down in Tennessee when I was on vacation last year. This was cool. It was a horseshoe. Got in there to Blacksmith's shop, banged it out, made up the little knife there. Pretty cool. So let's just go ahead and unbox this, see what we got here. And from Sennheiser, Sennheiser makes awesome audio products. I've got a bunch of their stuff and have used their stuff a lot. So my main microphone in my studio is Sennheiser MKE600. So that's pretty sweet. All right, let's see what we got here. Here it is. Here we go. Put that out there. So here's what we got. This is the Evolution Wireless Digital Portable ENG Set. So this guy is going to allow me to record in 32-bit float. So what this comes with here is a receiver that will plug into or a, I guess a transmitter, is what I should really say, transmitter slash recorder, which will plug into an XLR microphone like a shotgun microphone or something like that. It has receivers on it where it can hook up to your camera. Let's just open this guy up and see what it's got real quick. But the good thing about this is that it records in 32-bit float. Okay, and I'm sure as we move into the future here, there's going to be a lot more audio devices that record in a 32-bit float format. So let's see what we got in here. We got some batteries here for our kit. We have the receiver here, which is going to plug into your camera. I'll have to actually read the manual and stuff, make sure I know what I'm doing with all this stuff and make sure we're recording the right way. But this is the unit right here that is going to go on to your microphone. So let's take a look at this real quick. So you've got this unit right here, and this is what's going to plug into an XLR microphone. And on the back here, we've got a few different buttons. Looks like we've got a power button record, some other things going on mute. Phantom power, this can actually supply phantom power. So for example, the MKE 600 that I always use needs either phantom power or you could put a AA battery in it. So this is going to supply the phantom power for me. So really excited because I can take this with the microphone and go and film stuff. It can be a wireless setup. I got to read the book on how this works and how to set all this up. But this device is going to allow me to record in 32-bit float. So big deal because I want to get in there and try it out, like I said. And you guys have questions, and in order to answer your questions, I need to learn a little bit more about it. I need to use it. I need to try it out. And then I can make videos about how to work with it in DaVinci Resolve and how to just record in general with it. Right? Well, it looks like there's another pack in here too. So I'm not sure what that one's for, but we'll figure it out. Like I said, got to read the instructions, you know? But I'm going to get this back in my studio. I'm going to take a look at it, see how it works. We're going to get to recording with it. And I'm going to be making some videos for you guys about how to use 32-bit float as well as this unit itself. I mean, this is a really cool unit. No big thank you to Sennheiser and Zac for sending this out to me to try out. Really curious to get in there and give it a shot. So with that said, that's a quick little unbox of this guy here. Stay tuned for more info about 32-bit float, how we do all kinds of fun stuff with it. And if you need some audio stuff, check out Sennheiser because they're awesome. I mean, like I said, my main mic in my studio, Sennheiser MKE600. I've been using it forever. It's a fantastic microphone. Love it. So I'm going to go check this guy out and I'll let you know how it is after a little bit of time here. All right, I'll see you in the next one, guys. Peace. So you know it's weird. I've got a circular ND on my lens, so I can't see through it, but I see a reflection. And I don't know if I'm looking like cross-eyed like this because I see the reflection on my shirt in there. And it's kind of, honestly, it's kind of driving me a little crazy. Maybe I need to look at the Canon right above instead of trying to look into the lens because unless I just read the words. But anyway, I don't know. So I'm going to check this thing out because this is cool. See you. Peace.
