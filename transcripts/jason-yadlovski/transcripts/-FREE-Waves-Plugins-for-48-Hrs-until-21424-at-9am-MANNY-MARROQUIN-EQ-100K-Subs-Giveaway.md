The man a Maracuin EQ from waves is free. That's right free for you for 48 hours from the launch of this video Which is February 12th 2024 at 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time within the next 48 hours if you see this video go over hit up the link in the description Below you can get the plug-in for free from waves and this is just a little way that waves is helping me say Thank you to all you guys for reaching 100,000 subscribers here on my channel So huge. Thank you waves going over pick it up I'll show you how to get it installed a little bit later in the video But first I want to jump into resolve and show you a few examples of how this EQ works And why if you are a little scared about working with some EQ this plug-in a does a great job and B Makes it really easy for you to get some better audio and better EQ on your clip So let's head on over to resolve and check it out The first thing I want to do is show you where to find it once it's installed How to put it on a track and then a quick overview of the plug-in of what it is and how it works So let's jump over in the fairlight musical notes at the bottom Now I want to apply it to my audio track one to get started here So make sure you have your mixer open mixer right here. You want to come down to your effects click on the little plus Come down to EQ you're gonna go to VST now I have a whole bunch of EQ plugins here from waves but right here It's gonna say Manny M EQ and I have a mono track in this case So it's gonna say mono if you have a stereo track, it's gonna say stereo So go ahead and click on the effect and once that effect gets added on it's gonna pop up And this is what it looks like now one of the reasons why I chose this plug-in to give you guys is because it makes EQ Really easy. It's based on a whole bunch of different awesome Hardware EQs that Manny Merlequin has used over his career And he really combined a whole bunch of awesome stuff into one easy to use plug-in So if you don't know where to get started at all coming at the top here You can just click on the drop-down and you've got a bunch of presets in here And one of the ones that I like to use just to start out of the gate is the bright male vocal for me Now if you're a lady then go ahead and try one of the female versions and those will probably work out pretty good for you But you can see it can also be used on various instruments and there's other things that you can apply this EQ to It's not only for vocals or dialogue, but before I select one of those presets Let's just run over our window here for our effects so you can see what's going on starting on the left here We've got our input levels so you can adjust your input level if you want typically I'm gonna leave this at zero But you've got the option to either raise or lower that next here We have a high-pass filter now a high-pass filter says anything that's below a certain point that I set take that out I don't want it let everything that's higher than it pass through so on our high-pass filter here You can see we can grab this dial and we can crank it all the way up I mean as high as you want all the way up to about 750 is as high as it goes So for dialogue you're typically you typically gonna want to go around 120 Maybe bring it up a little bit more depending on your particular dialogue or your vocal You got to see how it sounds and we'll get into that in a minute The next section here is low-end frequencies. We can boost them or reduce them So the top gain one here allows us to boost if we go up or cut if we go down And you can see the positive and negative numbers there whether you're boosting or cutting the bottom frequency number here allows you to change the frequency now It's got preset frequencies for you and this is based on Mandy's experience and where the best ranges are to use the particular, you know, EQ Processing that he's used in his career. So I trust him because he knows way more than I do right So you've got your 50 Hertz, which is your low low frequency stuff. You've got a hundred 140 220 and 250 there you're gonna see how we're gonna just try these different things out and see how it sounds on our clip and then kind of decide To where to go from there the next section here frequency 2 is your load of mids. So we start around 250 We've got three twenty four hundred eight hundred and 1.5 K so again, you're gonna pick wherever you want to either boost or cut those frequencies And we can boost or cut right here One thing I didn't mention is that the yellow lights up here are actually buttons You can turn that particular frequency on and off if you want to in frequency three here We go from 800 1.6 K 3.2 K 5 K and 8 K and for our high frequencies here We go 10 K 12 and a half K 15 K 20 K and 25 K and down here We have the option to use either a bell shaped curve or we can use a shelf if we'd like to do that And finally over here We have a low-pass filter and this is gonna remove anything that's above The number that you set on this dial here So it's gonna remove high frequencies and allow everything below it to pass through and again You could just click hold and drag it down and you can change it to whatever you want it to be Finally here We've got an output knob where we can boost or reduce our overall output of the effect Sometimes when you process something in an effect like this or any other effect You might lose a little bit of that gain or volume as the dialogue comes out of the effect So here you can boost it back up. So let's hear it on some dialogue now. This is dialogue from the intro of this video I'm just gonna start with the preset the bright male vocal and I'm gonna start with it off play through a little bit I'll turn it on and see if you can hear the difference good headphones are gonna help make a difference for you So you can hear it a little bit easier So if you got them throw them on and here we go the Manny Mariquin EQ from waves is free That's right free for you for 48 hours from the launch of this video, which is February 12th 2024 at 9 so can you hear the difference there? It definitely cleans it up and does a pretty good job with it Now let's say maybe I wanted to tweak it a little bit maybe for my low-end frequencies I want to come to 140 and boost it a little bit lower around 800 is I think a good spot to make a cut like it did here Let's play through and you can hear the difference that it makes if I boost it or reduce it 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time so within the next 48 hours if you see this video go over hit up the link in it So a lot of times in that 800 range like it's gonna sound a little boxy ish and for my vote my vocal my dialogue It sounds better if I kind of cut it down in that area a little bit Now the other place that I might like to make a little cut is in the 1.6 to 3k range So on our second frequency here, I'm gonna actually change that to 1.6 I'm gonna raise this up and drop it down and we'll see what kind of difference it makes description below You can get the plug-in for free from waves and this is from waves And this is just a little way that waves is helping me say thank you to all you guys for reaching 100,000 I think that sounds pretty good and finally we've got a little brightening a little bit of sparkle on the voice a little bit of Clarity if you will so this is set at 20k and for speaking dialogue, that's a little little high I think so I'm gonna come down to maybe 12 or 10 and then do this little boost here and just see see what that does and See how it sounds subscribers here on my channel so huge. Thank you waves going over pick it up I'll show you how to get it installed a little bit later in the video But first I want to jump into resolve and show you a few examples of how this EQ works And why if you are a little scared about working with some EQ this plug, alright, I think that's pretty good I like it around 10k and it sounds like it just adds a little bit of crispness and clarity to my vocal my dialogue And finally we've got our low-pass filter. So when I'm just working with some dialogue I don't need really high-end stuff right I don't need the high-end frequencies because it's not like a singing vocal of Somebody who's got a higher frequency range voice so I could drop this back to I don't know 18k or something like that just to knock out any that high stuff that I just don't want So now I'm gonna watch my meteors here as well as down here And we're gonna see how's our levels looking and if I need to boost or reduce the output I could do that I'm gonna just come back a little bit and let's see what we got first from the launch of this video Which is February 12th? 2024 at 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time alright, so I think that's pretty good We did boost the output a little bit there now here's a quick little before and after I think it made a good job It was really quick. It was easy You don't have to know a whole lot you just use your ears right here and listen and make some small adjustments So here's a little before and after for reaching 100,000 subscribers here on my channel. So huge. Thank you waves Going over pick it up. I'll show you how to get it installed a little bit later in the video sounds great I think that sounds great. So now you're thinking well, what if I'm running gunning and I just have a microphone on top of my Camera of course it sounds good in your studio. What about that? So I've got an example here. We're gonna take a look at that I've got a stereo track this time gonna go over to my mixer click on the plus we're gonna come down to EQ add in the Manny M EQ and now I'm actually I'm just gonna go ahead and start with the bright male vocal and we're gonna see how it sounds from there So here we go little before and then after so the EQ of course works in the studio when we've got a good setup But what if we're outside running gun? We've got a microphone on top of our camera. Can we use the EQ on it? Yes, we can here's what it sounds like when we put it on this clip what it sounds like it's gonna do a good job for you It's gonna take out the guesswork out of trying to figure out what to do with the EQ She's gonna make your clip sound better. So what do you think do you notice difference? Does it sound good to you? Good setup, but what if we're outside running gun? We've got a microphone on top of our camera. Can we use the EQ on it? Yes, we can here's what it sounds like when we put it on this clip what it sounds like it's gonna do a good job for you It's gonna take there you go. I think that sounds pretty good. It did a good job of cleaning it up. It was quick It was easy. It took like no time right so really quick and easy and then finally I've got a singing vocal here Of a male voice and here's kind of what we can do with that So I'm gonna go ahead and add it on to my track. So back in my mixer click on my effects EQ VST Manny MEQ. So let's just play through trying to adjust this one all on our own and see how it does I'm gonna loop my playback here my range tool select this make sure my looping is turned on right here Then I'm gonna hit my space bar so we can make a little edit here.
