My thoughts on this overall are really just this. If you don't have anything and you're looking to get a microphone that's gonna do a good job for you, that has a bunch of features on it, you're looking to get into a decent microphone at a decent price, maybe it's something you wanna check out. What is happening guys? Today's video is a little twofold here. So one, we're gonna be testing out this guy, the Mono microphone here. I've gotta plug it into my phone because I think that's how most people would wanna use this microphone. At least that's how I'd probably use it. So we're gonna actually go into my church here because I have to update the Blackmagic Design Switcher that I helped set everything up for, for her live streaming and all that. I need to get in there and update it. And I've tried before, but I didn't have the right cable because you have to actually use a USB-C cable. So we're gonna get in there, we're gonna update it. And all the audio you're gonna be hearing is gonna be through my iPhone with the Mono microphone here. And I'm gonna leave links down below. You can check it all out if you're interested. And once we get back to the studio, I'll just give you a quick rundown of what it comes with, what I think of it overall. Once we're done updating the Switcher here, so let's go get into updating the Switcher. Upstairs we go. Old school room. That's a sit, we're all the way up there, all the way up there. Going up, going up, all the way to the top. We got our sound area over here and all the way up here. Back up in here is where we got the Switcher. There we go, here's our Switcher setup, little black magic design. TV studio, we got our camera controller right there. Big screen up there. One of the things real quick about the Mono mic that I like is that it's got a lanyard. It comes with a little lanyard, you can just throw it on here. I don't have to clip to my shirt or anything like that. Pretty sweet, the thing that connects to the phone there. Easy to use. It's a lot of stairs, it's a long walk to get up here, a lot of stairs. So the cable that I was missing before was a guy like this where we've got USB, was it A, I guess, or whatever, old school I'm gonna call it, to USB-C. I didn't have that. So I actually brought my daughter's computer which has USB-C to USB-C because I need a USB-C connect up to that. So I'm gonna actually try it on my computer because I didn't realize I had one of these. So we're gonna try this first and then see how that works out. All right, so we're hooked up here. So what I'm gonna do is actually come and open up the software for the switcher here and I'm gonna save the settings on there just in case something goes a little out of whack. So that should be good. So now we are gonna come down to our ATEM setup. We're gonna open that up, connect up to the switcher, TV studio, update available, update. Oh, there we go. Always doing something. So it's shut down, it's thinking, doing an update. So let's let that update run and then I'll be back to tell you how it worked out. Hopefully it works out good. But so far I'm liking this, the Mono microphone here. I think it's working out good. Of course we'll check it out in the studio when we get back to edit this video and I'll share my thoughts on it. I'll show you what it comes with and all the parts and pieces, all that kind of fun stuff. So let me get this switcher going here and I'll get back to you after it updates. All right, updates complete. Looks like it's running there. Everything looks good. I'm just gonna double check some things. Make sure that everything's working good. But the update seemed to work. The cord worked. I'm an old MacBook Pro here. You know, this thing's like 10 years old. Isn't that crazy? 10 years old on that MacBook Pro. Say what? All right, here's the deal. We checked it all out. Everything looks good. I was having a little bit of issues. Our fill and our key here, like it doesn't come through from the computer. But all I had to do was like re-click on the slides out there and then everything came up fine. So it all looks good, right? I noticed it looks a little bit different. It's got the way it's got the red around there. It kind of looks a little bit clear as far as which one's going out, getting sent out. And then the, let's see, the green one. So like the number two right here, that one shows you which one's on deck, right? And I do notice they got the little, I don't know, the little window around there. That's new, but everything worked out good. So Switcher's good to go. I'm actually running it on Sunday. So it's good to go. And hopefully I won't have any problems or issues or anything like that. I'm gonna get out of here. Is I gotta go grab a coffee and actually go to shop right. Pick up some stuff. So let's do it. All right, that's it. We out of here. A lot of times problem solving, right? We're solving problems with whether it's DaVinci Resolve, whether it's Switchers, whatever it might be. We're always working on problems here. So yeah, I'm gonna go hit up a little Starbucks, grab me a coffee, and then I'm gonna go and do a little shopping. I'm gonna get back to the studio. I'm gonna see how all this sounds. Checking it on my phone. I mean, it sounds pretty good. This microphone down here. The Mono, doing really well. It's super easy to use and it doesn't get in the way. It's little, I feel like throwing it on the lander because I can just take it on and off real quick and easy. But all right, with that said, we'll meet up in studio. So see you. We're back in the studio here and taking a look at everything that comes with this Mono microphone. Now, just a reminder that everything you're hearing is from the Mono. Got it right here. It's magnetized on my shirt here. So all of the audio is gonna be raw audio in this video from the Mono microphone. So let's just take a quick look at some of the parts and pieces that come with this kit. And as you heard already so far, I think it does a pretty good job. I like that it's got a lot of different options on how I can use it and wear it. So let's just talk a little bit about what it comes with. And the different ways that you can use it, wear it and get your audio captured in the best way possible. First up, everything that you need is gonna fit in this little bag so you can carry it around super easily. It's nice and durable. And when you open it up, it's got spots for everything in there. We can put our main charging box that holds the microphones and the receiver itself over here. We've got our different connectors for our different types of phones. We've got different clips over here where we can clip the microphone to whatever we want. And then we've got a little pouch on the other side that allows us to have room for the lanyards as well as the dead cats and the charging cord as well as the 3.5 millimeter cable that comes with it. So let's just take a look at this guy real quick. This is the charging case that the microphones as well as the receiver get charged by. So you charge this up, it holds charge, and then you could just pop everything right in there. And it makes it really easy to just get everything charged on the go. So in here, you're gonna be able to hold the receiver as well as the two transmitters. Currently I'm recording the audio from this microphone directly into the C100 Mark II. And that's the audio that you're hearing for this entire video here, especially in the studio. When we were out and about in the beginning of the video there, it was plugged into my phone. And what's really cool is we've got this case, right? We can pop that back into our little carrying case here. But we've got these two guys. As in these two guys allow us to be able to hook it up directly to our phone. Now one has an iPhone connector on the bottom and one has a USB-C connection. So depending on the kind of phone you have, you should be able to use one of these to plug it in your phone. And then you can use this microphone. It sends it right to this. You don't need the receiver like I have on top of my camera right now. You just use these guys and you can make adjustments in an app which we'll talk about in a second here. But these come in really handy and you heard the audio from my phone using this going directly to my phone. So you'd be the judge of what you think, whether it's good, bad. I think it came out pretty good honestly. Now one other cool thing about these little guys is they do have a port on the side. So if you need to charge your phone or you want to attach an external battery kind of thing to your phone, they do have a port on the side so you can plug this into your phone and then have a charging cable going into this so you can charge your phone. If you make longer form videos or maybe you need extra batteries or something like that. We also get these two little clips here. Now these clips are gonna go on the back of one of the microphones. So right now it's magnetized onto my shirt. I have a magnet inside my sweatshirt. But these little clips also have magnets on the back so you could just stick it wherever you want or you could just put this on there and then clip it to your hat if you wanted to do that. I mean these things are pretty small. Like they are not gonna get in the way. They're smaller than some of the square microphones that you've seen that people clip onto their hats or their shirts or whatever. So I do like that they're smaller. I do like that they do a great job of picking up the audio too. Kind of no matter where you have them. So two little clips here comes in handy wherever you might want to put these things. You probably can do it. As I already mentioned, you get the lanyard here right now. I think this is kind of cool because I haven't really seen any other microphones that give you like a lanyard like this where I can have a magnet on here, connect to the microphone and then I could just wear it. I can put it wherever or maybe I want to hang it somewhere that I'm around or whatever. I like the option of that because I don't always want to have to plug it in or stick it in my shirt and magnetize it. So if I just want to throw it on real quick, this is what I'm gonna use. These little lanyard guys. So they come in very handy. You also get a USB-C cable to charge up the charging box that everything goes in. And you also get a 3.5 millimeter cable that you can connect to the receiver and send that signal right into your camera that you might be using. So now some unique features. If you were using it with your phone here and you got one of these little guys, these little guys plugged into your phone, you've got the option to use the little microphone to start and stop recording on your phone. So if you set your phone a little farther away, you can hit start and stop on the microphone. There's a little button on there that you can press. And if you single press it, it's gonna do one thing. If you long press it, it's gonna do something different. But it'll start and stop your phone from recording or taking a picture or whatever you might need. On the main receiver, on the camera there, you do have the option to adjust your audio levels coming into the receiver there. You just turn this big dial and you're able to make adjustments how you'd like. You also have the option to change it from recording in mono to recording in stereo. Now another really cool feature on this microphone is that it's got some built-in noise reduction. And I'm gonna step outside in a minute here just so we've got a little more ambient noise so you can hear what it sounds like when we try the different modes. But it also has an app that goes on your phone that you can use to take a look at all the different settings and everything. I'm gonna show you that. Give me a second, I'm gonna swap out my audio here and then I'm gonna show you what that app looks like. So let's take a look at the app on my iPhone. I'm gonna throw it on the screen here so you can see what I'm looking at and what the app looks like. It's actually pretty good. There's a lot of options and features in here. So this'll be the first screen that you get and it will automatically sync up as long as you have your little device plugged in the bottom here. And I'm gonna go ahead and hit start. And now you can see we've got a lot of different controls in here. We've got a picture of the unit on the top and we can see that we're using microphone and I just muted it on accident there. We can adjust our microphone gain right here. Make it a little louder, make it a little quieter. We can adjust it there. We can use our noise reduction. So if I turn this on, we have the ability to say slight noise reduction and this is with moderate noise reduction and strong noise reduction. So hopefully you guys can hear that. I'm gonna go try that outside so that you can hear the difference there and see how that sounds. We have our sound coloration, which is gonna change the way that it sounds for us. So you can see right now it's turned on. If I click the dropdown, we can change it for voice enhancer, brightness, warmth, huskiness. It's gonna go ahead and change that. This is what brightness sounds like. Here is warmth. This is what warmth sounds like. And lastly, we've got some huskiness. Now I'm assuming that this is doing a little bit of like EQ work in the background there. It's not telling you exactly what it's doing, but it's just giving you an idea by the description there. So I'm gonna go ahead and turn off the sound coloration. So now we have the original Plain Jane audio. We've got our phone speaker output. You can turn that on and off. Your mono or stereo tracks right there. At the top, you can see that it says Wave T5, which is the name of this microphone. And we're at 97% batteries. You can also click on the little symbol in the top right there and that's gonna ask you or show you if there's any firmware upgrades for either the microphone or the receiver. You'll be able to update it if you need to right there. Currently, no firmware upgrade for now. And that is pretty much the app in a nutshell, but it's really convenient and easy to see. I think they did a nice job with it. It's clean, easy to use. You can turn on your noise reduction, your voice coloring or whatever you might want, but you might wanna jump in there before you get started recording, set everything the way that you want it and then you'll be good to go. So a lot of great things come with this microphone. I think it does a good job. Let's head outside real quick. And we're gonna try those all different noise reduction modes. So you can just kind of see what it sounds like with a little ambient noise from outside. And I'm gonna record it on my phone. All right, so here is with no noise reduction turned on. We're outside, there's a slight breeze, nothing crazy. Some birds. All right, a little bit, not too much. But now let me go ahead and take a second and we're gonna turn on the noise reduction on the slight setting and see how that sounds. And we're on the slight setting here. I hear a plane up there. Slight wind, barely any wind. Birds. And how does that sound? So now I'm gonna go ahead and change it over to the next one up, which is moderate I believe. So let's try that. All right, we're on the moderate setting here now for the noise reduction. How's that sounding? Again, slightly little breeze, nothing crazy. Some birds, nothing fancy. But here's the moderate setting for the noise reduction. Now let's go try the high end, whatever the most noise reduction one is. All right, perfect timing for a little strong noise reduction because now we've got the wind blowing a bunch. Okay, so we'll see if that noise reduction cuts that out. If you can hear me nice and clear. Again, the microphone's right down here. My little string keeps falling on it. But yeah, I think this setup's working pretty good. And you did hear some of the other settings there as far as the coloration, but let me turn this off and I'm just gonna go change to a different coloration so you can hear what that sounds like. Okay, and finally, no noise reduction on here. And I change the coloration to voice enhancement. I think that was called, I forget. I just looked at it and I forget. But here's what that sounds like. But overall, I think this does a pretty good job. I mean, it's a nice little microphone. It's compact in size, picks up well, both indoors, here I'm outdoors. You can hear what it sounds like for yourself. Maybe it's something that you might be interested in if you're looking for a small form factor microphone, easy to hook on, easy to use, and something that's easy to fit in your bag or even your pocket, right? Stick it in a jacket pocket, stick it in your back pocket. I think this microphone could do a great job for a ton of different situations, especially if you don't have anything else. I think this would be a great place to start. All right, so this wraps up the review here and just the testing out and experimenting here with the Mono Wave T5. I think it does a great job and you can actually get it on sale now on Amazon for $99. I know it's on sale for 109. There's a little coupon there. You click that and it'll give you another $10 off. So I'll put that link in the description below. You can check it out if you're interested. But my thoughts on this overall are really just this. If you don't have anything and you're looking to get a microphone, that's gonna do a good job for you that has a bunch of features on it, that has some noise reduction, which is gonna help you make your video sound a little bit better, has some enhancers for your voice and your dialogue, because maybe you don't wanna edit your videos or you're just filming on your phone like I am right now and you're just gonna post it, right? I think this kit can do a really good job. It's got a lot of features and options. I believe that there's a kit that's a little bit cheaper that doesn't have as many of the pieces. You could check that out. But Modo's been around in the game for a long time when it comes to audio. I've seen them around a lot. I actually stopped by their booth last year in NAB out in Vegas and they always have great stuff that doesn't break the bank, you know? So if you have nothing, you're looking to get into a decent microphone at a decent price. Maybe it's something you wanna check out. Again, I'll leave link in the description below. And a big thank you to Modo for sending this guy out. Let me give her a try and just giving you guys an honest opinion on what I think about it, how it works and letting you be able to hear it. Because if you're interested in it, you probably wanna know some of the things we covered here, just what it sounds like when you're just using it and trying to make some videos. So with that said, I wanna thank you guys so much for watching and thank you, Modo again. And I will see you guys in the next video. Peace. Hope you enjoy see you guys in the next video. Thanky you. Hope you enjoyed it. Bye.
