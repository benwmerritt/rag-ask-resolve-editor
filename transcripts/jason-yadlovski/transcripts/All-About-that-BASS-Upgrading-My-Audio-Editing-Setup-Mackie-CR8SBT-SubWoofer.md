So all about that bass, about that bass. Today we are taking a look at this guy. This is a subwoofer from Mackey. It's the CR8S. And I had to open it on the floor here because it's too big to fit on my desk. So recently I took a look at some new monitor speakers that I put on my desk up here, just to kinda upgrade my setup a little bit, some Mackey monitors. And I had asked some questions to Mackey about the subwoofer here and how it connects up and how it sounds and all that kinda stuff. And they said, hey, let us send you one and you can try it out, see what you think. So they didn't ask me to make this video. I just wanna share it with you guys, let you know my thoughts, how it works, how to set it up and if it's something that maybe you've been looking for, maybe you want a subwoofer for your audio setup, maybe it's something that you might wanna look into. So let's just crack this guy open here and see what we get here in the box. And we're gonna set it up with the speakers that we've already got. Gonna see what kinda wires and connections it comes with. And it will be nice to have that extra low end because the monitor speaker's like, unless you get the bigger ones, I mean they have some bass, but they're not, they don't have a crazy amount of bass in there. So let's see what we get. We open it up, we got, obviously you got your manual, always need that, right? Now we do have a bunch of different cords in here. We've got a couple of, looks like, these RCAs I guess, and then we've got the power cord and we have a cable for like a remote control here that will hook up to the speaker, that will run up to my desk. So that way we can kinda control how much bass that we have and we can make it sound the way that we want. So we're gonna put these guys on the side, open this up here and let's see what we got. I know Mattiki always does a nice job of packing their stuff here. Like, I mean the cardboard in here, like it's pretty solid. So let's get this guy out of here. Oh, it's heavy, I tell you that much. It's heavy. All right, let's get this out of here. Close that up, push that out over there for now. Bring this guy over. Oh, it's heavy, dude. Yeah, got some weight to it. Pretty big too. Get the plastic out of here. Don't need that. Now just like the little speakers, this comes in like a nice, it's like a cloth bag here, which is nice. It protects it well. I like that, it shows you that they got some care taken when they're packing this stuff up. So here's what it looks like. I mean, it matches the speakers that are up on my desk. This thing is that it's nice, it's big. It feels solid, it's heavy, it's got some weight to it. But let's take a look on the back here. So on the back of the speaker here, we've got our inputs and our controls and everything. Let's just start at the top here. We've got our inputs, our left and right for TRS connections. We have RCA unbalanced connections right here. We've got our controls down the middle here. We have an input level, right? Where we can change that. We have a sub output level. So how much is getting an output from the sub? We have a crossover here. So sometimes you're gonna want only certain frequencies to come to here and then the rest to go to the other speakers. So you can change where that frequency happens. You can change the polarity to zero or 180. And then you've got your outputs on this side. So the way it works is you're gonna have your computer or your audio interface come into the sub as the first speaker in your setup. And then you're gonna have outputs from the sub because the sub is gonna keep all of the low end frequencies that the sub uses. And then it's gonna pass everything else out through these outputs right here. So you've got your TRS outputs. You also have RCA outputs and you've got this CRDV, which I'm not sure what that means at the moment. Then you've got your power button down here as well as your plug. Now, if we just flip her over real quick here on the bottom, you got your port, right? To let out the air and the bass and have the air movement and stuff. Get some good bass going. And on the front here, it's just a nice grill over top of the speaker. It's got the same color green as the smaller speakers up on my desk. But overall done very nicely and it looks like this is a button right here for connecting up to Bluetooth, I'm assuming. But it looks like a nice build quality, feels solid. The grills here are nice. It's nice that it's not an open speaker or anything like that. So let's get into setting this up and see how it sounds. So I decided to put it on the floor over here in front of my desk, right? On this side where I usually keep my camera because I can plug it in right here and I'm gonna show you how we can hook this up. It's pretty easy, it's not too bad. So first step, let's take a look at some of the cables that we got. Now we need to go from our audio interface, right? Which right here is my audio interface. We're gonna go from that directly to the subwoofer instead of going to my speakers right over here. We don't wanna do that because just the way the sub works it pulls out those sub frequencies first and then sends the rest of the signals over to my two speakers on my desktop. So first thing we need to do is just unplug our right and left channels from over here and we're gonna plug that into the sub. So we got the left input. So then we're gonna take our left input here right from the audio interface and it's gonna go right into the left input right here on the subwoofer. And then we're gonna do the same thing with the right. Got the right and right is gonna go in the right side. Boom, there we go. So the next step is to run our outputs from the sub here and we wanna run it back up to our speaker over here and we wanna plug them in over here. So I'd like to use the TRS but I don't have more TRS cables so we're gonna use the RCA's for now and then I'll just pick up some more cables and we're gonna get a chance. So we did get some RCA's included. That's what I'm gonna use cause I don't have any more of the TRS cables there. So we're just gonna hook these up. You're gonna go red to red, white to white, pretty straightforward, we'll plug them in. Next step in the process, power cord. We're gonna go ahead and plug that in. All right, all set there. Last thing we gotta plug in, which goes to the plug that I've said I didn't know what it was is actually this guy, right? It's a little remote control here and that's what's gonna allow us to change the level and stuff of the sub as well as I think it's a little volume button on here. And this guy is gonna go right in here, the CRDV. Boom, there we go. And we're gonna fire this up once I make it upright and then we're gonna jump onto the desk. Now one cool thing is with this little remote, remote, I call remote controls, moats, but on the bottom here, it's like a suction cup so it'll stick to your desk. Kinda like that, that's kinda cool, I like that. Good thinking, man, good thinking. So let's get all this stuff up on the desk. So we'll put this up here, we're gonna fire it up and then we're gonna see how it sounds and I'm gonna do my best to translate to you guys on what I'm hearing, what it sounds like and what it feels like, right? What does bass feel like? So let's do that. So I got it all hooked up here. Here's what we got over here for our setup. I've got my audio interface right here. Over here I've got the sub remote, I'm gonna call it or moat as I like to call it. This is your volume right here, right, for these speakers. So I don't have to use the volume on the speakers itself. I can use this volume right here. And then this outer ring is the amount of subwoofer that's getting put in there. So I can turn it all the way down, play back and then see how that sounds. I do leave the tone knob right here all the way on work, which is gonna give me a flatter frequency response so when I'm editing, make it sound better or however I want. So that's the basic setup and then this speaker, this one over here, speaker goes over to that speaker. So let's go ahead and hear how it sounds. It sounds pretty good. It does fill out the sound rather nicely. I'm gonna boost up the bass on this one clip just to see what it sounds like here. So if I select my clip, I'm gonna open my EQ here in DaVinci Resolve. And I'm just gonna give a little bass boost here. And let's try that. Oh, a little much there. I'm gonna go ahead and turn it on. I'm gonna go ahead and turn it on. I'm gonna go ahead and turn it on. I'm gonna go ahead and turn it on. I'm gonna go ahead and turn it on. There's a little much there. All right, it does sound good. I almost thought it would be a little stronger, but I think if I adjust some of the settings on the sub itself, that'll bring it out even a little bit more. But overall, I mean, it does fill out the sound pretty nice. So let me make a few adjustments here on the sub itself. And then we're gonna regroup. I'm gonna play through a few more songs here and just kind of see how it's sounding. Another tip that I noticed here real quick. So what I did just to kind of get a little more low end out of that is I actually turned down the sub just a little bit so it's not like maxing its output. But on my speakers right here, I took the volume knob and I lowered it down, right? Because it was up a little more, so I lowered that down and then actually brings out the bass a whole lot more to lower those down a little bit quieter. These make these guys a little bit quieter and now the bass comes through a whole lot more. So I think it sounds great. I was throwing on a little Luke Combs there. I don't know if you guys are country fans, but I love me some Luke Combs. I was throwing on some of that and that bass was kicking. It was good. It sounded really good. So again, you gotta play with the volume a little bit back and forth between the volume on the speakers, the volume on the sub, the volume in your computer. You got lots of volume, so it might just take a little trial and error to get what sounds good. You gotta play with it a little bit, but you'll figure it out. I'm confident that you can do it. So just wanted to do a quick mention of that as you adjust the volume of the speakers up top so you get more out of the sub, balance it out a little bit better because I created a sound design with Casey Ferris a while back for a Star Wars scene that he created. And I just want to see how that sounds once we add in that subwoofer, right? Because that's going to make a difference on, you know, just bringing out the low end of everything. So let's go ahead and play through that and see what that sounds like. Give you my honest feedback and reaction here. I think the addition of the subwoofer here for my audio setup is going to make a big difference. I think it's just going to help me hear those low end, you know, sounds and frequencies and everything a little bit better. And really excited to get into editing with it and just kind of see how it works out. Now, one thing I do need to do is that if you take a look at my speakers on my desk here, right, they're a little low, right? So basically you would want these to be up a little bit higher, right? So they're kind of at eye level with me, right? Or at least so the tweeters are up at eye level. So instead of actually putting stands on my desk, what I thought about doing is just creating a little 3D print where I can do this and angle these guys up a little bit like that so that it's actually shooting towards my ears instead of just kind of shooting in my chest right here. So that makes a difference because I noticed if I duck down, you know, and I'm on eye level with the speakers, it does make a difference on how they sound. So speaker placement is also very important and something you want to keep in mind when you've got your little setup like this, speaker, speaker, subwoofer down on the other side. So you want to keep that in mind too. Speaker placement, where they're at, what are they aiming towards, your angle of the speakers, right? It's a whole little science there. But I think I'm going to create some of my own 3D prints here and, you know, boost those up a little bit. So if you're interested in little speaker stands, maybe I can make that available or something. So, but overall the sub here is really good. I mean, I like it. It sounds good. I think it does a great job. Thank you, Mackie, for sending that out. It's easy to hook up. I do think I'm also going to get some TRS cables there so I can get rid of the RCA's because I think the TRS just do a better job, I think. So I'm going to get those. They'll be balanced and all that kind of stuff. So I'll pick up some of those on Amazon and nothing fancy, just, you know, some cables that are balanced cables for me. But overall, really excited to have this extra piece to my audio kit here while I'm trying to edit all of the audio. As a difference resolve audio guy, I need some good speakers, right? Because 90, 95% of the time I'm editing on the monitor speakers. I'm not really using my headphones unless I need a reason to like keep it quiet in my office down here. So that's a quick little overview of the sub. It does a good job. Sounds great. Thank you, Mackie, for sending it out. I'll leave a link in the description below. You can check it out if it's something that you're interested in. The whole little CR series setup here is redesigned and it's new and updated from what I have before. I think they do a great job. Build quality is good. They feel solid. They sound good. They sound better than my old pair and really excited to be working with these. And a huge thank you again to Mackie for sending these out. They didn't sponsor this video. They didn't even ask me to make a video, but I just figured, you know what, I want to share it with you guys. So here's my experience and take it for what it is. So a big thank you and I will see you guys in the next video. Peace.
