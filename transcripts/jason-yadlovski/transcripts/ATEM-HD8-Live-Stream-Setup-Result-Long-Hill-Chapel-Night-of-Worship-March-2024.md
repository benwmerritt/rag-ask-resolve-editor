Welcome to Long Hill Chapel, we're excited that you're here for our worship night. I am literally just talking to catch my breath. We're so excited that you're here and interested and willing to spend time in song and prayer and spending time in the presence of God. It truly is needed in our day and age today to just find time to put away distractions and to step into intentional worship. It's a lost art and I'm so excited to be doing that with you tonight. We're going to be singing songs that might be familiar, songs that might not be as familiar. We invite you to sing, if you know it, to sit and to meditate. We invite you to just have a respite from your life, essentially from your schedule, your agenda, everything you have going on. You can leave at the feet of Jesus tonight and you can worship and lift your voice for who he is and what he's done. Amen? Amen! Let's continue and worship. Music All my words fall short I've got nothing new How could I express All my gratitude I could sing these songs As I often do But every song must end And you will never do So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again All that I have is a Hallelujah Hallelujah I know it's not much but I've got nothing else fit for a key I've got nothing for a heart singing Hallelujah Hallelujah Got one response I've got just one My arms stretch wide I will worship you I throw up my hands and praise you again and again So that I'm happy to have a Hallelujah Hallelujah I know it's not much but I've

of Jesus Christ The earth would shake Beneath the weight of darkness Music In his brow a crown of sorrow For a king whose weakness was austere The word he spoke is the word shown from the Lord to save Oh the cross of Jesus Christ Is the reason of my life For his blood has set me free It will never lose its path for me Music Now the dawn of resurrection Was the night as hope prevails to shine Salvation rings, chains to break And we rise Oh the cross of Jesus Christ Is the reason of my life For his blood has set me free It will never lose its path for me Oh the cross of Jesus Christ Hallelujah What's so beautiful about me Hallelujah It is all for me Hallelujah That's my victory Hallelujah That's my victory Hallelujah What's so beautiful about me That's my victory Music On the day he comes in glory To reveal the fullness of his reign All hearts will bow Before the sign of Jesus name Oh the cross of Jesus Christ Is the reason of my life For his blood has set me free It will never lose its path for me And we rise Oh the cross of Jesus Christ Is the reason of my life For his blood has set me free It will never lose its path for me It will never lose its path for me It will never lose its path for me Amen Music Gathered at the highest throne Welcome by a melody An anthem I have always known A song that's always been in me All glory and honor, dominion and power to you A

We thank you for your presence among us and God as we continue in worship may our hearts continue to be drawn to you. It's so easy to be distracted and think of all the things that we have to do but God we lay down our desires right now. We come to the feet of Jesus. We come to the foot of the cross and we say we just want you. It's not about our agendas. It's not about our thoughts or our plans of what we have but we just want you and we want you to speak. And so would you continue to speak as you've been speaking through these words and these songs? Would you continue by the power of your spirit to move in this place? I'm caught up in your presence. I just want to sit here at your feet. I'm caught up in this holy moment. I'm not here for blessings. Jesus you don't owe me anything more than anything that you can do. I just want you.
