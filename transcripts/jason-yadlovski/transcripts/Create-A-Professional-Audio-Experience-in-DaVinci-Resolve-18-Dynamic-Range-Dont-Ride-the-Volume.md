Have you had this happen to you before? You're sitting on the couch, you're trying to watch a YouTube video on your TV, and you find that when the volume is quiet in the video, you have to turn up the volume on your TV just to be able to hear it. And when that volume gets real loud, you have to turn down the volume on your TV because it's too much and you don't want to blow your ears out. But what you're hearing there is a wide dynamic range for your audio, and that just means we have the loud parts really loud and the quiet parts really quiet. And this is why it is important to think about the dynamic range of your audio while you're editing it in DaVinci Resolve. We want to make sure that our loud parts aren't too loud and our quiet parts aren't too quiet. We want to bring them a little bit closer so that we still see a difference or still hear a difference, but we don't want our audience to have to use the remote control to change the volume of the video while they're watching it. So today we're going to talk about that, improving the dynamics of your audio in your videos right here in DaVinci Resolve. And I've got an example that's going to demonstrate this for you on how we can take the loud parts, make them a little bit quieter, take the quiet parts, make them a little bit louder, and give our viewers a good listening experience while they're watching our videos. So to let's be honest, if your audio stinks, nobody's going to hang around to watch our videos. If you want other tips on making your audio awesome in DaVinci Resolve here for your videos, make sure you subscribe to my channel because I got a ton of good stuff coming up, a lot of stuff in the back catalog if you need to check any of that out. Let's jump into Resolve and I'm going to show you how we can work with our dynamics and make it sound better for a viewer. Let's go. So I'm in DaVinci Resolve right now. Let's play the sample clip so you can hear the difference that I'm talking about between louder parts and quiet parts. And then we're going to help balance all that out in DaVinci Resolve here. So take a look at this example. So sometimes in our videos, we talk loud like this. We set our levels based on us talking loud or our subject talking loud. But then there's times where people maybe they're a little farther away. Maybe they just decide to talk a little bit quieter because I got to tell you something about the game that's going on here that I don't want everybody else to know about. Well, for your viewers, they may need to adjust the volume on your video and you don't want them to have to do that. So we can use compression here in DaVinci Resolve to help reduce our dynamic range and make it a better listening experience for our viewers. And I'm going to show you how to do that with this clip. So there's our clip. Notice in our waveforms here in Resolve, we have what appears to be louder parts. And then in the midsection here, you can tell it's a lot quieter because the waveforms are smaller. Now we could come in here and manually keyframe this and bring up the quieter parts. But we can use the dynamics and the compressor to do it for us automatically in order to access our compressor, we need to jump over into Fairlight. So right now I'm in the edit tab right here, we want to jump into Fairlight, the musical notes at the bottom here. So now that I'm in Fairlight, I'm just going to make my audio track a little bit bigger here so we can see it nice and good. Now we want to work with our compressor and our dynamics. So in order to find that you need to have your mixer open. If your mixer is not open, click on this icon at the top. And then down here we have dynamics, you should see it here in your mixer. If you don't, click the three little dots and you have mixer or dynamics, I'm sorry, dynamics right here. So go ahead and double click on your dynamics. Now when we're looking at our dynamics panel, the compressor right here is the section that we're going to be taking a look at right now. So I want to go ahead and turn on the compressor. Now a compressor, when we turn it on here, what it's going to do is take those loud parts of our audio and compress it down a little bit, right? It's just going to make it so it doesn't get as loud as it otherwise would if we didn't have a compressor on there. It's going to squash it down just a little bit in basic terms. So we can adjust our compressor by changing our threshold right here. If you want to reset it, you can just double click any of the knobs here. And then the other one you want to take a look at is ratio, right? So for dialogue, usually between two or three is going to be good, maybe around 2.5, kind of like this 2.5 to one, it's a good place to be for your dialogue. So I'm going to play through our clip, we're going to reduce the loud parts just a little bit. And then we're going to work with the quiet parts and make those quiet parts a little bit louder. So let's go ahead and play through the clip. And all I'm going to do is adjust this threshold right here, so that it is compressing some of my audio. Now we'll know that it's getting compressed by looking at this middle slider right here, it's going to light up and tell us how much compression is being applied. So let's go ahead and play through this. And we're going to adjust our threshold. So I'm going to double click just to reset it to start from scratch. And here we go. Sometimes in our videos, we talk loud like this, we set our levels based on us talking loud or our subject talking loud. But then there's times where people maybe they're a little farther away, maybe they just decide to talk a little bit quieter because I got it. Okay, so we're compressing down to about minus 6 dB, which is a good spot to be for your dialogue. And as we got to the quieter part here, we saw that the compressor wasn't doing anything, because that compressor doesn't need to because the audio is too quiet, right? So now let's talk about how do we make our quiet parts a little bit louder. So we're going to use the makeup slider here in our dynamics panel to do that, which is this guy right here. So I'm going to play through the quiet parts of our audio here. And I'm going to boost this up. And I want to watch my output meters. And I want to see where does that quiet audio start. So for example, if I play a little clip of it here, decide to talk a little bit quieter, because I got to tell you, you can see it's a little over 30 minus 30 dB. So maybe it's about minus 27 dB, somewhere around there. Why want to make that a little bit louder? I probably want that to be somewhere between maybe minus 15 and minus 20, somewhere around there. And then that should be a good level for us for our final audio clip here. So let's go ahead and make the adjustment as we play through the quiet part of our audio here. And all I'm going to do is take this makeup, boost it up, and I'm going to watch my meter, my output meter over here to make sure we're getting the levels that we want. They just decided to talk a little bit quieter because I got to tell you something about the game that's going on here that I don't want everybody else to know about. Well, all right, so let's try maybe right about there, right? Now when the audio gets loud again, I don't want it to get screaming loud too loud, right? So we might have to adjust our compressor a little bit, just so that it doesn't get too loud. So I'm going to watch from the beginning, I'm going to watch my meters. So as the video is playing, I'm going to watch the meters over here. I want to make sure the loud parts aren't much more than minus 10 dB, a little bit over is okay, but we want to kind of keep it around that minus 10. And then our quiet parts should be where we just set it somewhere around that minus 20 to minus 15 somewhere in that range. So let's play through our clip, watch our output meter here. And we can make adjustments to our makeup if we need to for the quiet parts, or our threshold right here, if we need to compress our louder parts a little bit. Let's see what we got. So sometimes in our videos, we talk loud like this, we set our levels based on us talking loud or our subject talking loud. But then there's times where people maybe they're a little farther away, maybe they just decide to talk a little bit quieter, because I got to tell you something about the game that's going on here that I don't want everybody else to know about. Well, for your viewer, they may need to adjust the volume on your video. Okay, so I think that's pretty good. Watching the meters while we're playing it back, it sounds okay in my ears. And as far as where do our levels fall in the meter is looking pretty good, right? So let's just do a quick little before and after. So here is dynamics off, I turned them off. And here's what the original clip sounded like. Sometimes where people maybe they're a little farther away, maybe they just decide to talk a little bit quieter because I got to tell you. Right, so you can hear the difference there. Now if I turn on our dynamics, but then there's times where people maybe they're a little farther away, maybe they just decide to talk a little bit quieter because I got to tell you something about the. Okay, so can you hear the audio there? It's a little more consistent. There's not such a wide variation between the loud parts and the quiet parts, right? Now when you're recording, you want to capture all that, right? Because we can work with it in post here and make it sound the way that we want, you know, work with our dynamics a little. We do want to capture that dynamic range when we're recording, just so we have the options of doing different things with it. But you want to make sure that your levels are at least good enough for your quieter parts that you've got something good to work with. So by improving the dynamics of your video by using the compressor, along with the makeup slider there in our dynamics panel is just going to make a better viewing experience for your viewer. Now there are sometimes where you want a big difference between the quiet parts and the loud parts. But in general, we want to make sure that that dynamic range is in a good spot so that our viewer doesn't have to ride the remote control and turn the volume up and turn the volume down when they're watching your videos. Because if you have audio problems with your videos, there's a good chance people are going to jump off your video and not keep watching it because it's just hard to watch. It's hard to hear. So dynamics super important. Try it out on your videos. Make sure your dynamics are set up good here in DaVinci Resolve when you're working on your projects. Guys, with that said, thank you so much for watching. Questions, comments, leave it down below. You want to learn more audio stuff in DaVinci Resolve here.
