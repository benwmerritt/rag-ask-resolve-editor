Guys what is happening jump it on here real quick to talk about the new audio features here in DaVinci Resolve 19. I'm watching the live stream from Blackmagic Design it's actually still going on right now but these audio features were so awesome I had to just jump on here and make a video for you guys and tell you about them in case you haven't seen the live stream if you haven't check it out it's awesome there's so much good stuff coming in DaVinci Resolve 19 really excited about it but I want to talk about some of the audio features that are coming out and actually by the way I'm gonna be at NAB in Las Vegas from Sunday through Tuesday so if you're there look for me I want to say hi I want to meet some of you guys but let's just get right into some of the cool stuff that is coming here in DaVinci Resolve 19 for audio because I'm an audio guy we love audio first one up I got my little list here is the music remixer and I'm just gonna show you what it looks like here if you check out the live stream here let's take a quick look and see what the music remixer looks like and then I got some thoughts to share with you on it the Fairlight page has exciting new features and effects that enhance your creativity and save you time let's start in the inspector where you'll find three new AI based track effects music remixer is an AI plugin that lets you remix music tracks to fit your show start by enabling the music remixer on a track containing music open the controls and adjust levels for vocals drums bass guitar and other sources you can change a vocal song into an instrumental track with a single click remix the different instrument levels and even automate changes over time so the remixer tool here really cool AI tool here in Fairlight where we can sculpt the music and make it sound the way we want so it fits with our videos a little bit better we can add in the voice we can take it out sometimes you've got a great track but it's got some singing in it you want to get rid of that and it looks like this tool is going to be able to use the voice dial there to just pull out the voice right we can also bring in more drums bass guitar or other instruments this looks like a really cool tool that is going to come in real handy and allow you to use more kinds of music as opposed to having to find something that for example doesn't have any vocals in it right because maybe it's going to contradict or conflict too much with you know your speaking or your dialogue in your video so really cool tool now I don't know if we're going to be able to remix the track so let's say we've got a music track that's like three minutes long and we only need you know two minutes of that track this tool doesn't look like it's going to remix the track for us so it'll fit with the length of time that we have but I'm not sure I mean maybe that's in there and they just didn't mention it I'm definitely going to be digging into that tool a little bit more when DaVinci Resolve 19 is available here because this thing looks pretty cool really excited about that feature so that is a track based effect so if you had multiple you know music pieces of music you'd want to put them in different tracks and then use the music remixer on them so really looking forward to giving that one a try the next one is something called dialogue separator so let's check out what this is and I'll share a few thoughts on it dialogue separator uses AI to give you independent level controls for dialogue background sounds and ambience so you can refocus recorded dialogue and lower distracting background sounds while preserving the reverberant field of the room when you vote Jamie Woods you feel a real leader I remember birthdays or decreasing the excessive ambience while adjusting background sounds as needed over time when you vote Jamie Woods you feel a real leader I remember birthdays this is perfect for improving location recordings in active spaces will you teach me how to surf so the dialogue separator there this is really cool that we've got three controls that we can change the voice the background and the ambience of our clip right now I'm curious to see if we dial back that voice one all the way to the minimum are we gonna get just the background noise and it's gonna remove the voice force because I know a lot of you guys have been asking for that and you just want the background noise maybe you're filming some kind of nature stuff and there's people talking along the trail you want to remove the voices and currently the voice isolation wasn't doing that for you couldn't invert it so you only heard the background noise it would only remove the background noise right but I know a lot of you guys want to remove the voice so really curious to see if this tool do that they didn't show that here they just showed how you can reduce the background noise and the ambience a little bit but I'm curious if you were to dial back that voice knob there will you get just the the ambient noise in the background noise and not the voice will it remove the voice for us I don't know we're gonna have to play with that once I get a hold of DaVinci Resolve 19 here but that is one that I know you guys have been asking for so we're gonna see how that voice dial works here once DaVinci Resolve 19 is out take a look at the next one on the list we have the ducker now you could always automatically duck but now they made it even easier so you don't have to jump in there and know too much about what's going on it's gonna kind of do some of the work for you let's check this out then I'll share a few thoughts the ducker makes it easy to get a good mix automatically by using the levels of one track to manage the levels of another track without the need for keyframes or automation in this scene the music track is overpowering the dialogue just enable the ducker on the music track and choose the dialogue as the source track then adjust the amount that you want the music to lower well use the controls to adjust the duck level and response time will you teach me how to surf the real-time waveform display shows the level changes in the music whenever dialogue appears as the source track all the track effect available in the mixer and the inspector for the selected track to choose which track effects are visible in the mixer use the mixer options menu so the ducker effect here does essentially the same thing as what the dynamics panel used to do only it makes it way easier for you guys so if we look at the window here you can select your track really quick and easy as far as which one you want to be the source right so your dialogue track for example then you've got your duck level and all you have to do is spin that dial there right we don't have to worry about working with the different tools in our dynamics panel you can just set your duck level there you've got a look ahead so that seems like how far ahead is resolve going to be checking what's going on on that track that's our source track right then you've got rise time hold and recovery which essentially is the same as your attack hold and release in the dynamics panel right only it's a lot easier to understand especially if you're not an audio nerd like myself you're really going to be able to quickly create that automatic ducking and then it's cool that they've got the graph there right we can see the graph we know what's happening and we can see exactly how our you know music track for example is responding to our dialogue track so I think this tool looks great it looks like it's going to do a great job it's easier to use although you could I think essentially get the same results if you were using the dynamic panel but this just makes it a whole lot easier and especially being able to select your different source tracks it just seems easier and quicker for you guys to do you don't have to know a whole ton about audio stuff so duckers really cool I'm going to be looking forward to using that because it's easier and quicker than doing it opening the dynamics panel and stuff so ducker really like that one next up we have some AI audio panning now you can do any kind of automation here in resolve got a video all on that but here the panning can use a little bit of AI to track things as it goes across your screen because when we're working with our audio right it's cool to hear it go from you know right to left left to right move around your head that kind of stuff so check this out we're going to see the AI audio panning here and then I'll share a few thoughts on it completely unique to the venture resolve you can now do AI based audio panning in the Fairlight viewer using IntelliTrack you can automatically track people or objects and generate precise pan automation the track an object mark a range in the timeline and select the track you'll find the tracker controls in the Fairlight viewer here you can enable auto tracking and select the pan parameters you want to track move the tracker to the object on screen and start the tracker you'll get fast intuitive results without the need to spend hours manually creating pan automation to match picture here you can see the finished pan automation curve in the timeline or open the pan window and use the new 3d perspective options to visualize the auto panning movement in relation to the listener you can also do manual pan tracking directly in the Fairlight viewer so the AI tracking works really good there when you have something like a jet or a car or you're trying to create sound that sounds like it's moving past you it's just little things like that that are going to help make your editing process a little bit quicker you don't have to keyframe and manually pan it it's going to be able to do it for you there so that's a really cool feature there I like that it looks easy to use pretty straightforward you do get into the automation a little bit but it kind of helps you get started with that right by doing some of the work for you so really cool really looking forward to trying that out I wonder if that's something that there'll be you know features added into the tracking you know for audio and stuff like that you know as we move ahead are we gonna be able to do more things than just panning I don't know guess that remains to be seen here and you know maybe that'll come in a later version of DaVinci Resolve 19 but that looks pretty cool so the next thing up is a whole bunch of updates for Atmos and Ambiosonic Ambiosonic I can't even say Ambiosonic which is like you know sound coming from all around you something I'd actually like to get into a little bit more I haven't done a whole lot with it but just designing sound in 3d space around you whole lot of cool stuff that they've updated here let's just roll the tape here and I'm gonna share a few thoughts after checking this out this is really cool Atmos workflows along with full support for recording mixing and delivering ambisonic spatial audio ambisonics is a full sphere immersive surround audio format that can accurately represent the entire sound field around the listener to begin in preferences navigate to video and audio IO to immersive audio and enable ambisonics now you'll have access to the full ambisonics toolset so you can create ambisonic tracks and buses up to fifth order use binaural monitoring to experience immersive sound while working with headphones or choose a monitoring format that matches your delivery requirements and speaker configuration the Fairlight ambisonics panner displays 2d or 3d spherical panning within the sound field and can be used to position mono or stereo tracks within the field metering options include a single composite bar graph in the mixer and timeline and energy sonar or power displays use the space view scope to monitor high order ambisonic sources as they relate to other sounds and the room or enable 360 degree viewer mapping in the Fairlight viewer for dynamic graphical metering of either intensity or a sonar style view there's even support for third-party ambisonic head tracking and plugins so some really cool updates there for atmos and ambisonic if I can even say it right creating audio that's you know surrounding you and stuff something I haven't gotten into too much but would love to get in there you've probably heard this kind of audio before if you have a pair of those Apple AirPods right and you put on the what's a spatial mode I think it is and it sounds like when you turn your head things move and it sounds like it's coming from all around you and stuff so that stuff is really cool I almost feel like I need to go sit in on some training for that but really look forward to maybe getting into there and trying that out this year a little bit more I'm just checking it out and seeing how we can build sound in a 3d environment that's really cool next thing that you guys are gonna like that you've guys been asking for and I haven't asked for it but I would love to have it because when I mix live music I often have a spectrograph or I can see where frequencies are on the EQ as the music or the audio is playing back and now we have that in DaVinci Resolve 19 so check this out this is what it looks like and then I'll share a few thoughts on it the Fairlight channel EQ has been updated with real-time analyzer and selectable slope for high pass and low pass filters right here they're called friends and sidechain control is now available for capable Fairlight effects and AU and VST plugins all right so there you go you saw the EQ now has a spectrum graph in there so we can see where the frequencies are this does come in handy when you are trying to find a particular frequency that might be giving you some trouble you're not sure where to look you're sweeping but can't really tell being able to see the graph on there and where all your different audio frequencies and levels for those frequencies are can be a huge help just helps you find things that you might be having issues with you can see what is going on with your audio do I have too much low end too much top end is there something that's peeking out in the middle there that I don't like I want to get rid of so that is something that people have been asking for for quite some time it's kind of like a standard feature on other you know EQs that I've seen and that I've worked with especially when it comes to live music and stuff so really excited about having that one in there I think that's going to be a really handy feature for you guys and for me as well in the dynamics panel there you saw now we have updated side chaining abilities right so I'm gonna have to get in there and play with it and I know that this is one of the things that true audio people who makes music and and do like just audio stuff a lot of times they want to be able to use the side chain for different effects and different processing of music and things like that and resolve was a little limited in the side chaining ability so now it looks like they did add a bunch of I'm gonna say versatility and and usability to the side chain so I'm gonna have to get in there and play with it once we get it but it looks like it's a good update and it's going in the right direction to really help bring Fairlight full circle into like a full fledged DAW similar to some of the other DAWs that you know people might be using out there and maybe you know with these features as they keep adding them in it's gonna allow you to go to DaVinci Resolve for all of your music needs all of your video pretty much everything one-stop shop it'd be interesting to see how well it works out I'm curious to get in there and try it out play with some side chaining and stuff like that but that's another great feature that I think people from the music world have been asking for for quite some time and part of the reason why they're not jumping ship over into Fairlight is because the the side chaining didn't really work as as as it does in other audio programs so that's a big feature I think for you know audio specific people that that they've been looking for for quite some time here in Fairlight so there you have it that is the audio features that are being updated here in DaVinci Resolve 19 now I'm sure there's gonna be more stuff in there they kind of give you a whole list once it comes out but they just highlight some of the big big ones in you know their live streams and stuff like this Daria did a great job of running over all of the awesome features the big updates here in DaVinci Resolve 19 in all the different tabs there's a ton of great stuff there also some great hardware that Blackmagic has updated or is putting out that's new really excited to actually get there in person in Vegas starting on Sunday and check out this stuff at Blackmagic Designs booth guys really excited if you're gonna be out there make sure you try and find me if you find me say hello would love to talk to you and meet you with that said guys thank you so much for tuning in stay tuned as soon as 19 comes out I'm gonna be downloading it and making videos on the audio stuff but a little bit of everything here along with all my other fellow DaVinci Resolve creators alright guys with that said I look forward to seeing you in the next video I'm off to go back for NAB and I will see you in the next one. Peace!
