It's turkey week here in the United States and DaVinci Resolve 19.1 has so many awesome updates This one is one of my favorites being able to access your EQ effects and Dynamics right here in the edit page. Check this one out In DaVinci Resolve currently I'm in the edit page and now we can access the effects dynamics and EQ Make sure your mixer is open if you've got one of those things applied to a particular channel You're gonna see it highlighted right up here. All you have to do double-click the EQ boom here is our EQ We can make any changes we want. This is our track level EQ that we would get in Fairlight We can adjust our dynamics right here in the edit page double-click here is our dynamics We can work with our compressor our expander gates and limiter Same thing that you would see in Fairlight and you can also adjust your effects from the open mind specter Double-click on the effects and we're gonna see all of our parameters here now I don't like to look at my effects like this. There's too many buttons and knobs going on here, right? So what you can do is click on this little icon and that's gonna open the effect back up for you in the window that you like to Look at it in similar to how you would see it over in Fairlight now All these are still accessible in Fairlight But it just makes it a little bit quicker and a little bit easier to make these track level adjustments Right here in the edit page now if for example, you didn't have any dynamic set you can see right here It's not highlighted which means I have no dynamics on this channel I can still double-click it open it up and apply my effects on to this particular track Now one thing you do want to know is that you can't apply your track level presets in the edit page here For example, if I come up to Fairlight our presets library, I don't have access to it You still have to jump into Fairlight So if you have presets for your EQ your dynamics and your effects You're not gonna be able to put those on here in the edit page You still got to jump over to Fairlight to do that But at least being able to access these things once they're applied to the track or before you even apply anything right like we showed with the dynamics So being able to access these track level tools from Fairlight right here in the edit page Just helps speed up my workflow nice work black magic design. Appreciate you guys You keep adding awesome awesome features here to DaVinci Resolve and making our life a little bit easier and Making the workflow a little bit quicker. That's this quick tip Tuesday. What are the features you want to know about? I will see you in the next video.
