I am excited to be announcing channel memberships here on my YouTube channel I've been toying with the idea of starting the memberships for a while and recently I've been going through a whole course that YouTube is providing about channel memberships and about how I can help provide you guys with Some more value so the whole goal of the channel memberships is kind of two-fold It's one to give you guys more value and it's also a way for me to help keep this channel sustainable So I can continue to make awesome videos for you guys So I appreciate all of you whether you are interested in memberships or not. That's okay I just appreciate you watching videos commenting liking all that helps contribute to my channel Being successful and allowing me to be able to do this full-time for you guys and just make awesome content and help you guys learn to Venture resolve and video editing and of course audio stuff too So I'm sure the memberships are gonna evolve over time here But so far I set up three different levels and I just want to show you what they are if you're interested You could check it out. If not, that's perfectly okay, too So let's take a look at the first tier here that we have for the channel memberships The first level of membership is called the loyalty fan member and it's 299 a month and here's what that gets you It's gonna get you some custom icons that are gonna appear next to your name So depending on how long you've been a member of the channel You're gonna get a different color icon here and you can see on the screen What ones are for how long so one month two months six months 12 months 24 months 36 48 and 60 months And I created little DaVinci resolve Logos here or icons that are different colors and they kind of correspond with how YouTube does their colors for the various lengths of Memberships so you're gonna get one of those based on how long you've been a member And then you're also gonna get cool custom emojis that you can use in the comments or on live streams when I do live streams So down here you can see I've got a few different custom emojis We've got the color tab the edit fair light and fusion So I thought those are kind of cool, right? You can add those in and not everybody's gonna have them only the members are gonna have them in addition to those two perks You'll also get priority response to comments So I try and respond to everybody's comment But it's kind of getting to the point where I can't really get back to everybody But if I see that you're a member you are gonna have priority in me respond to your comment or trying to help you out Over somebody who's not a member. So I think that's a good little perk Since it's getting a little hard to keep up with all the comments that I get on my channel But I still am gonna do my best to respond to everybody even if you're not a member The second tier of the channel membership here is gonna be discounts and free files So you're gonna get a 25% discount all the time on whatever you want on my store on my Shopify So anything that's already there as well as anything I add in the future You'll get 25% off on that and then you're also gonna get free files So if I make a tutorial kind of like I did with my superhero landing instead of providing those files for free to everybody There'll be so some I provide for free But most of them I'm gonna charge a few dollars if you want to download the file to follow along But if you're a member of this tier two membership, you're gonna get those files for free I'll give you guys a code so that you can head on over to my Shopify download them for free You can just follow along with the tutorial that's gonna be up on YouTube So I'm gonna try and do more of that where I can provide you guys with free files And even if I don't make the file available to everybody I'm gonna try and make the files available to members of the tier two membership here So that way you've got things to try out to play with and to follow along with the various videos that I'll make The third tier here is $9 and 99 cents a month and it's gonna be monthly live streams Where any of the members of this tier can jump on the live stream we can interact we can talk we can Answer questions that you might have we can figure out issues you might be having work through things You know, we're gonna see how how it all goes and and Depending on what you guys need which kind of questions you have we'll figure out You know how it all works and everything but we'll spend some time there online together And I could just help you out with any issues that you might be having now each one of these tiers If you did a tier two you get tier one and tier two if you did tier three you get tier one tier two and tier three So keep that in mind whatever level you might pick if you're interested you get everything below that as well So again, this is not something that I'm expecting everybody to jump in on But I wanted to give you guys the opportunity if it's something that you're interested in and you want to help support the channel more You want some more value from me the channel memberships are a way we can kind of make that happen And like I said, these might evolve over time and we might add in different kinds of things But for now, this is where we're gonna start and I just want to try and give you guys as much value as I can out of Meat and my channel here all while keeping it sustainable so that I can continue to do this for you guys over the years I've really enjoyed having this channel. It's just been a blessing to me. I love doing this stuff Really excited that I get to help out so many people out there and that this channel has grown to over a hundred thousand subscribers It's just it blows my mind like I can't can't believe we're there. It's crazy But it's a blessing that I can do this and be creative and help so many people and not have to go sit back at a desk job right so Thank you guys so much for all the support that you give me whether it's dropping a comment or just watching a video even You don't even have to do anything just by watching a video You're supporting me and I appreciate it and uh, you guys are awesome. You guys are awesome.
