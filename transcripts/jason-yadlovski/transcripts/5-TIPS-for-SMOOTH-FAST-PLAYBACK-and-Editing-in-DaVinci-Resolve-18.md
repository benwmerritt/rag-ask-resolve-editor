Today I've got five tips for you that is going to help make your playback smoother and quicker here in DaVinci Resolve 18. So if you got a little bit of choppy playback there, this video is for you. But hey, if you're new to my channel, my name is Jason Yilofsky and I make tons of videos here about DaVinci Resolve to help you get started and help you learn Resolve and help you edit some awesome videos. All right, let's just jump right into making your playback smoother. Let's go. Jumping right into Resolve here, I've got a project open here that's a pretty big project. My DaVinci Resolve 18 quick start guide, if you haven't checked it out, link above, check that out. Number one. So first tip on speeding up your playback here in DaVinci Resolve. This is what you're going to do. You're going to come into your project, you're going to come up to the playback menu and down to timeline proxy resolution. And I think by default it's set on full here and that means you see everything in full resolution. But you can change this to half or even quarter. Now this is only going to affect your playback. It's not going to affect the final render quality of your video. So you don't have to worry about that. It's just going to make Resolve playback your video smoother for you and lighten the load on DaVinci Resolve and your computer. So for me, a lot of times I'll use half and I don't really notice a quality difference all that much between working in the half mode versus full or you can use quarter if you want. Either one is going to help speed up your computer and speed up your playback here in DaVinci Resolve. So that is tip number one. Number two. Tip number two here is to enable your render cache. And what does this mean? This means that DaVinci Resolve can do some work in the background whenever you stop working. So if we come on up to our playback menu and come down to render cache, we have none smart end user. Typically, I'm going to leave this on smart and that's going to tell DaVinci Resolve, hey, when you stop working by default after five seconds, start rendering things in the background like transitions or effects or maybe a fusion clip or something. Work on that in the background while I take, you know, more than a five second break. So that way when you come back and you go to play your video, some of that stuff's already going to be pre-rendered and it's going to be able to play back smoother and easier here in DaVinci Resolve. Now you can change the default setting of how long it takes before Resolve starts doing some work in the background. I change it to one second because as soon as I stop, hey, Resolve, you get to work there, buddy. But by default, it's set to five seconds and that works out just fine too. So this is going to help you speed up your playback by allowing Resolve to render things in the background while you stop working. Maybe you're getting a cup of coffee, a cup of Joe right here and Resolve can do some work in the background for you. So that is tip number two. Number three. Tip number three here is a good one and that is to bypass your color grades. So if you come into the edit tab here where I'm working, we've got this little icon right up here and if you click it, it's going to turn off your color grades. So sometimes when we add in a bunch of color grades to Resolve here, it slows down our machine a little bit, especially if you're doing some more intensive things like noise reduction or, you know, some other effects there in the color tab that might slow down your machine a little bit. So when you bypass the color grades, it just makes it easier on your machine to kind of move around your timeline. Maybe you got to make a few edits or something and you don't care about the color grade while you're making those edits. By passing the color grade is going to help speed up your workflow and speed up the playback here in DaVinci Resolve. So that my friends is tip number three. Number four. So tip number four here is another one that can really speed up your playback here and that is to edit in a 1080 timeline. So you might be working with 4K footage, 6K, 8K, 12K, who's doing any of those big resolutions anyway, right? But maybe your footage is in 4K, but you can edit in a 1080 timeline and then just change it back to 4K when you're all done before you render it out. I'm sure you had to do that real quick. So right now I am in a 1080 timeline. So if I come down to my project settings, the little gear icon at the bottom here, open up my project settings and right here, timeline resolution, I'm at 1920 by 1080. So once I've gone ahead and edited my whole project in a 1080 timeline, which makes it easier for your machine to process and work with, I can come back here and just timeline resolution boom, come down to ultra HD 4K, boom, save. And it's going to scale everything up for me. If you have 4K footage, it's going to use those raw files, the full size of the files, and you should be good to go here. Now if I'm using 1080 footage, like I edit a lot of stuff in 1080 footage, I can also change it and it's going to upscale my 1080 footage for me. And for what I do for YouTube, that works out great. So one thing to check after you change your project settings to be a 1080 timeline or back to a 4K, double check this right here. You want to double check your timeline in the media pool. So check it out. If you open the media pool, come down to a timeline here. I'm looking at my YouTube vid timeline. Have it right here. I'm going to right click on it. I'm going to go timelines and timeline settings. And that's going to bring up this window right here. Now in this case for this timeline, I had use project settings checked on. So when I made the change in project settings, this timeline took those changes and that's what the timeline became. You can see right here, it's 13, 8, 13, sorry, 38, 40, if I can read right here, 38, 40 by 2160. However, if you did not have this checked on and you made the changes in the project settings, it's not going to update your timeline. So for example, I have another timeline here, timeline number five. If I right click timelines, timeline settings, and I take a look at my settings here. Notice use project settings is not checked on. And the timeline did not update based on those settings. We just changed in the project settings because that's what I told it to do. Right. I said, do not use the project settings. So in that case, you want to check your timeline settings here. You can come and then in here, just change it to whatever you want 4K, whatever it might be, you can do that. Now this is a vertical video, so that's why the resolutions are a little different here. A little YouTube short there for you, but definitely check your project settings to make sure your timeline has the settings and the resolution that you want. Always good to double check things. But working in a 1080 timeline is really going to make the processing easier on your computer and it's going to make your playback smoother here in DaVinci Resolve. So in a 1080 timeline, that's what I do. It works out pretty good. And I recommend it. And that is tip number four. Five. Tip number five here is if you have files that are really big or you've tried these other things and it's still bogging down your machine, you can go ahead and create proxy files or optimized media as it's called also here in DaVinci Resolve. Let me show you how to do that. Back in DaVinci Resolve here, if you open your media pool, you find some of your clips that you want to create optimized media for that maybe are a high resolution or something like that. So I'm going to come in here and let's just say, you know, this guy right here, this file say it's a big six K file. I want to I want to create some proxy media or optimized media for that. I can right click. Come on down to generate optimized media or you can generate proxy media. So you might be wondering what's the difference between proxy media and optimized media? Well, essentially it's the same type of file, but with optimized media, DaVinci Resolve manages all those files for you, right? You can't go and grab them and give them to somebody else. You can't do anything with them. Resolve manages those optimized media files. Now, if you use proxy media, you're creating those same files, but you have the option as the user to find them on your hard drive, put them wherever you want, send them to your friend who's working on the same project. So he doesn't have to create the proxy files as well. You can relink them up. Boom, you're good to go. So proxy files allow you to dictate where things are stored and manage them yourself. Optimized media says, Hey, DaVinci Resolve, I don't know what I'm doing. You take care of it and just link everything up so that we're good to go. And when you use either optimized media or the proxy files, Resolve is going to use those in the timeline and make playback smoother for you. But when you go to render, Resolve is going to use all of your original high quality files by default without you actually having to do anything. It's just going to use those high quality files when you render out. So that way you get the best quality that you can when you're exporting your project. And as a little bonus tip here for you, if you are creating those optimized media files or the proxy files, you can select what type of format you want. Those files to be in. Check it out. Just go to your project settings, a little gear icon at the bottom here and come on up into master settings. And then if you scroll down, you've got optimized media and render cache. So you've got the option here to choose the resolution automatically. You can select different formats that you want it to be in. And right here is where you can enable that background caching that I mentioned down to one second. Default is five seconds right here. I change it to one second because, hey, Resolve get working as soon as I stop. And then also as an extra, extra bonus here, if you scroll down, working folders right here, this is where Resolve is going to store all of your cache files, any proxy media that you might create, as well as any gallery stills and stuff. So I change this to an external hard drive because before you know it, keeping this on your internal hard drive can really fill things up. So you might want to just take a look at these file locations here and put them somewhere on an external hard drive and SSD or something like that. And that's what I do. And it seems to work out pretty good. Number six. And you know what I'm going to go ahead and throw in a bonus number six here, things that can speed up your playback here in DaVinci Resolve. And that is sometimes when we add audio effects onto our video, depending on the effects that you're using, the plugins that you've got, it can bog down your video a little bit. So if you jump over into Fairlight, love me some audio here in Fairlight here, let's say for example, on my track number three right here, you can see I've got a bunch of effects on there. Well, generally the effects are what may cause a little bit of lagging or slow down in your timeline and in your playback. So you can come here and just click on this in button right here. And that is going to turn off the effects insert. What does that mean? It means it's going to basically turn off your effects and you're not going to have them applied to your audio channel. So if you're having some choppy playback and you think it's audio related because you're using a bunch of plugins, go ahead and click on the effects in button here to turn off the effects and that should help with your playback a little bit. Now, generally I've only found this an issue when I've had a bunch of effects on there or some third party plugins in there that just require a little more processing power from my machine. But if you've got those effects on, you think the audio might be causing some choppy playback, definitely turn off the effects insert, turn off those effects and that should help make some smoother playback for you in DaVinci Resolve for your project. There you go. Five tips on making your playback smoother here in DaVinci Resolve. If you've got other questions about Resolve, I probably have a video about it. So definitely check out my channel.
