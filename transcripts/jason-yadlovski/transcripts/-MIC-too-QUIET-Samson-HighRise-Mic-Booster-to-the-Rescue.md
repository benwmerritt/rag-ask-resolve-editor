What's happening guys we are getting ready to film an episode of the DaVinci Resolve podcast I know it's been a while we're gonna get back into it filming it some more But what I wanted to talk to you guys about was this guy the high-rise microphone booster from Samsung So when I record the DaVinci Resolve podcast, I use this guy the Q9X from Samsung It is an awesome dynamic microphone does a really good job But sometimes with dynamic microphones, you'll notice that you don't get enough Gain or enough volume of the microphone as you're recording. It's a little bit on the quiet side So sometimes you need something like this which is a microphone booster And what this does is makes the signal louder for you before it comes into your audio interface So I just wanted to share it with you guys We're gonna be using it on this episode and I'm gonna Sum it up and let you know how this thing works after I film the episode because I haven't used it yet But I'm excited to give it a try here. So let me just open it up show you what it comes with and what we got In here, so you do have some instructions Look at that later. But if we open this guy up here It's essentially a little box that has an XLR on each side and input and an output and What we would do is plug our XLR cable You're gonna need a little jumper cable like this So you're gonna plug in your XLR cable to the input or the output in this case I'm gonna use the short cable here for the output and It's gonna come from the output of this and go directly into my audio interface. So we're gonna go right here We're gonna output from there bring you guys over here We're gonna then plug this right here into my audio interface right over here So taking a look at the unit itself here. It's about four inches long It's not very big and on the left side here We have a low cut which will cut out any frequencies below 120 Hertz But in this case, I don't want to do that because I can always cut that out in post later But if I don't record it, I don't have it in case I want it So I'm gonna leave that turned off then on this side. We've got three different levels of boost We've got plus 20 DB HF lift Which means it's gonna increase the treble or your higher-end frequencies a little bit while it boosts your audio by 20 DB So it should in theory increase the clarity of your dialogue a little bit while you're speaking in your microphone Then we have a standard plus 20 DB right here and then a plus 30 DB So I'm gonna probably start with the standard plus 20 and we're gonna see how that works out So we have this end which is gonna connect to our audio interface right back here And then our microphone is gonna connect on the input side over here. All right, so here is the deal We've got the microphone set up got our XLR. That's gonna get plugged into the microphone So now I'm gonna unplug the microphone from our audio interface right here We're gonna plug that into the input side of our high-rise booster So now the microphone is coming into the booster the booster is gonna boost it and then send it out to the audio interface So we're gonna connect the output side here to our audio interface All right, so our setup is complete microphone hooked into the high-rise microphone booster to boost our signal connected to our audio interface now right now if we take a look at the Booster itself on the side of the microphone. There's a little power light and you notice it's not lit up That's because I need to come to my audio interface here and turn on my phantom power. So I'm gonna hit 1 48 volt phantom power is now on and if we come back and look over here at the booster We can see now that little power light is on we got power and we should be getting some good levels for settings I'm using the low cut off and for boost. I'm going with just the plus 20 DB So now looking at my evo 4 audio interface what I can do is have it automatically set the gain for me by pressing the green button And then pressing number one and the green button again, so I'm gonna do that and see where it sets our levels at We're just gonna talk into the microphone here. It's gonna automatically set our levels for us We're gonna see where we're at and then we can test it Although I know my levels were turned up pretty high So it'd be interesting to see where it falls with the plus 20 DB gain So taking a look at our audio interface here if I press my number one That works pretty good to be right about here Because in the past I would have to turn it almost all the way up in order to get some decent levels out of this microphone And then still boosted a little bit in post. All right, here. We are testing out the microphone again We're just letting the evo 4 audio interface Select our get automatic gain levels for us So we're gonna see where it falls with the plus 30 DB versus the plus 20 DB and now our levels should be lower on the audio interface So now we can see that looks like it's good our levels are down there instead of up here When we had on the plus 20 so it's definitely doing a good job If I were to unplug it my levels on my audio interface would be a whole lot higher So now using the high-rise mic booster I can just get extra gain out of my microphone and when it comes to dynamic microphones like these guys You a lot of times need that extra boost right you needed something to increase that signal on its way in so that way You've got good audio to work with once you get it into your editing program of choice Which should be different to resolve fair light because I'm a fair light guy loved to ventures all fairly all right I am gonna go test this out We're gonna record the DaVinci resolve podcast and I will wrap up this video once I get done with that and we see how it sounds So guys just got done filming the DaVinci resolve podcast using the Samson Q9 X right here and the high-rise mic booster. This thing is great. I mean it did a fantastic job Really happy with how it performs It's great and if you wanted to pick one of these guys up It's like 80 bucks 79 99 from what I see looking online right now But just to give you guys a real quick, you know listen to what it's doing here So on my audio interface here, I have it set if I check my levels at about 50 I'm gonna say 55 percent about on the dial here and I have the mic booster set to the plus 20 db now I'm gonna change it right now to the plus 20 dp db hf So now it should be boosting my high frequencies a little bit give a little more clarity to the voice And this is what it sounds like on the 20 db lift Setting and I can even hear it in my headphones. It's definitely a little bit crispier. I actually it sounds it sounds pretty good What do you guys think drop comment? Let me know and if I'm gonna go back to the plus 20 db Right now it's gonna sound like this. This is just the regular plus 20 db without the high frequency boost Let me go ahead and I think if I turn off the phantom power then I think I think let's hope this works We should only be getting whatever the raw level is with the just the audio interface set at about 55 percent So let me turn off our Phantom power because this does need some phantom power. We're gonna turn our phantom power back on there So that did work. I'm gonna actually once I get done showing you the last setting here I'm going to just unplug this plug it in here and then you'll be able to hear it directly What it sounds like with the same settings on the audio interface here. So right now we're going to go to the plus 30 db So I have not changed I'm going to talk a little quieter because it looks like I'm going to be peaking if I if I talk too loud But on my audio interface here, I can see I'm getting more levels. I'm recording directly into resolve with this microphone I can see I'm getting more levels If I talk about the same, well, I guess it's not quite peaking, but it's getting up there. It should be it's loud So let me go turn that back All right, there we go. And I also have the low cut filter turned off now. I don't think I have a very bassy voice But um, let's go ahead and turn that on And here's what it sounds like with that a low cut filter turned on so it's knocking out everything below Was it 20 120 hertz there? So this is what that sounds like with the low cut filter on Go ahead and turn it back off So let's turn it back in real quick. I disconnected the uh, the high rise right here So now it's going directly into the audio interface at the same level You see right there light up same level we're about 55% and you can hear how quiet the microphone is So this thing is making a big difference. So let's get back to using this So what I've been doing is just using the standard 20 db Setting here and that seems to have worked out good. It does a really good job of giving me the extra gain I need on this microphone coming into the audio interface You know dynamic microphones like this need a little bit of a boost They do a great job at isolating, you know noise from coming around, you know, or picking up noise around you Um, and this does a great job of giving you that boost that you need. It's small It's lightweight. It has a couple options on there for you You know with the the low cut and the the high lift and the plus 30 db does a great job Samson you did an awesome job with this one and coming in at about 80 bucks like that ain't so bad You know, I mean you can use this with uh, you know Dynamic microphone like this or any other microphone where you need to boost that signal a little bit Um, you know xlr input So, uh, you would need an xlr to go from the device to your audio interface But if you got that just plug in the other side and boom, you're good to go It it does a great job. So I just want to say thank you samson for sending this out if you need Boost in the gain on your microphone. Check this guy out. It's it's cool. I like it I'm going to be using it every time I use this microphone for sure Might even try it on my regular microphone setup and see how that works too You know, just get that a little extra gain without having to really crank up the audio interface there does a great job I'm impressed with it. My whole DaVinci resolve podcast was recorded using that Uh, so you can go over check that out listen to that and you'd be the judge see what you think But um, yeah, thanks so much samson for sending this guy out really appreciate it. It's awesome Samson's got great products. This microphone is a samson too is fantastic. It's I mean, it's a great microphone So I'll leave links to this stuff in the description below if you guys are interested and with that said Thanks so much for watching guys. I will see you in the next video. Peace
