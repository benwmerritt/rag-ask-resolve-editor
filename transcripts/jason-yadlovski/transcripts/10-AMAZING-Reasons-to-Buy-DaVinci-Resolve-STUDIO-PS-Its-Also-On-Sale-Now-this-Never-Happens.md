Reason number one, you should buy DaVinci Resolve Studio right now is because you buy it once and you're gonna have it forever. You're gonna have all future updates. You're gonna have DaVinci Resolve Studio, the latest and the greatest for the rest of your life. What other companies are gonna sell you something like that? Blackmagic Design does and they are just awesome. It's currently Thanksgiving week here 2024 and as of this filming, DaVinci Resolve Studio is on sale for $235. This is the first time it's ever been on sale that I've ever seen. So if you were even thinking about studio, that's a huge reason to get it too. It's on sale. You'll buy it once and you're gonna have it forever. That is reason number one, you should go buy DaVinci Resolve Studio right now. So hit pause and go buy it and then you're gonna hear the other nine reasons why you should buy it. Reason number two is the ability to read more codecs and more file types. In the free version, you're somewhat limited. You ever open it up, drop in some files and you're like, how come I can see this file everywhere else but I bring it in resolve and I can't see it? It's because you're not on the studio version. So you're limited to the file types and codecs that resolve can use in the free version. You buy studio, it opens up a whole bunch more file types and codecs that you can use right in DaVinci Resolve. Reason number three, voice isolation as an audio guide. Do I got to say any more than that? If you don't know what voice isolation is, here's a little how it works. A little example in the studio, blasting some music out here. We're gonna use the voice isolation to go from what you hear now to we're gonna turn on voice isolation and this is what it sounds like. You're able to completely remove music, background noise, whatever it is in your videos and bring out that voice. And here it is turned off. It's so good. It'll remove music from your voice. It will take pretty much any background noise you want all the way out or you can just drop it down a little bit. Does a fantastic job. And if there's only one audio tool that you need or you only need voice isolation to remove that background noise in your audio, it's 100% worth the purchase price of studio because you're going to get all the other awesome stuff with it. But voice isolation is reason number three. You need to go by studio right now. Reason number four is that we've got all kinds of cool effects in there that are only available in the studio version. If you try to use them in the free version, you're going to get a little watermark on there or whatever. You can still see what they do, but you're not going to be able to use them. So you want to use studio or get studio. So you've got access to all of the awesome effects that are available in DaVinci Resolve Studio. Reason number five, you want to go by studio is because of the noise reduction. DaVinci Resolve Studio has some awesome noise reduction tools. They do a great job, but you've only got access to them. If you have the studio version, here's a little example of what it looks like. The sixth reason you want to go out and buy DaVinci Resolve Studio is because you use subtitles on your videos and you want DaVinci Resolve to do the heavy lifting for you. Resolve Studio can create subtitles from audio in the studio version. It's a one click button. Boom. Done. It's going to create the subtitles for you and it's really quick and easy. So if you use subtitles at all and you want Resolve to do the work for you studio, that's where it's at. Reason number seven, let's talk a little timeline resolution in the free version. You're limited to 60 frames per second and a timeline resolution of 3840 by 2160. Now for most of you, that might be okay. But as technology moves on here, we're going to be using higher and higher resolutions and DaVinci Resolve Studio allows you to take full advantage of those higher resolutions. So in Resolve Studio, you can work at 120 frames per second up to 32K, which seems ridiculous. And you can also work in HDR. So if you want to work in any of those higher resolutions, maybe not 32K, but if you're getting in that 8K, 12K range studios where it's at, you're not going to be able to do it in the free version. Reason number eight is because you can get a video clean feed. So if you want a clean feed coming out of Resolve so you can monitor what you're doing, check it out on another screen. You need the video clean feed and that is a studio only feature. So a lot of people use that and they wonder why is it not in the free version? Because you need studio to do it. So if you're looking for the clean feed, you got to pick up studio. Reason number nine here encompasses a whole bunch of different tools and that is the DaVinci Resolve neural engines. So with studio and these neural engines, you're going to get things like the magic mask, which makes it super fast and easy to select objects and mask them out. You're also going to get smart reframe. So if you create a lot of vertical video, but you film it horizontal like this, smart reframe is automatically going to keep you or your subject in the center of the frame while it's moving around when you go from a horizontal to a vertical format. Really handy and it does a great job. Works really good. Speed warp. So if you want to make something super buttery, slow motion, but maybe you didn't film at a high frame rate or maybe you did, but you want to make it even slower, speed warp is going to do an awesome job at really just making that buttery smooth kind of looks like this. Object removal. Let's say you've got something in your video clip that you want to remove. Object removal uses DaVinci Resolve's neural engines and it's going to do a great job at taking out those objects that you don't want, but you got to have studio to do it. And another one here that uses the neural engines is the face refinement. So take a look at this little clip of me. I think my face looks pretty good, but if we throw on the face refinement, make a few changes, it could kind of look like this. We could clean up this old mug right here and do it in DaVinci Resolve Studio. There's more to the neural engines and what they do, but those are some of the big things that it does and it's a great reason for you to go out and buy studio. The 10th reason is you are going to get better performance here in DaVinci Resolve Studio than you are in the free version. Now, why is that? Well, there's a bunch of different reasons, but one of the big reasons is the ability to use multiple GPUs and GPU acceleration in studio. So the way I put it is I started Resolve on a 2015 MacBook Pro. It had a GPU in it, but when I was running the free version, it ran okay. You know, this was a couple versions ago, but when I upgraded the studio and was able to make full use of my little two gig GPU there, it just made it run a whole lot smoother on my computer. So being able to utilize the GPU a little bit better and a little bit more in the studio version makes a good performance improvement on your computer, even if you've got a little bit of an older computer, at least from my experience. Now, your experience might be a little bit different, but you're going to be able to use the GPU better and more of them. If you've got multiple GPUs using the studio version, which is just going to make the program run better for you, it's going to save your headaches and frustration. And I would almost say that that's the biggest reason that you should go by studio is because you're going to have better performance and the program is just going to work better for you. So there you have it. Ten reasons why you should go out and pick up studio right now. I'm not getting any kind of kickback for this. There's no incentive for me to push Resolve and tell you guys why it's so awesome, even though I think you already know that it's so awesome. But I'll link below to Blackmagic Designs website. You can head over there, pick it up for $235. If you get it soon, I don't know how long the sales lasting, but I've never seen it on sale. So if you want it, go get it now. So that way you get the sale price of $235 US. Otherwise, I mean, even at $295 US, it's still a deal. It's a steal. So head on over, pick up Resolve and then come on back and we can talk a little bit more about some of those Resolve only features. All right, guys. Hope this was helpful. I will see you in the next video. Peace.
