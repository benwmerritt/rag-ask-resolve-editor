Hey guys, what's happening first? Quick Tip Tuesday here in the new studio space. And DaVinci Resolve 18.5 just came out. I've been going through it checking out all the awesome features here. It's amazing, tons of great stuff. Today's quick tip is something that I've wanted in Resolve for quite a while. It makes just moving things around a little bit easier or it might be a lot easier. We used to be able to do it with only audio tracks. Now we can do it with video tracks. Let's jump in and resolve them. I'll show you real quick. You're going to love this. Let's go. You'll love the ability to move around audio tracks using the index. Now we can do it with video tracks. Really helpful when you need to just reorganize some stuff quickly here in Resolve. Check it out. There's a project here where I've got a bunch of audio tracks, a bunch of video tracks, where I re-edited Peter McKinnon's Rolex video. Check that out. But if we want to move tracks around quick and easy, I'm in the edit tab and now just come up to the index at the top. Now in the index, make sure you're on the tracks section right here. And now we can see our video tracks as well as our audio tracks. And you can literally just click any track, click hold and drag and rearrange it. You can put it wherever you want. Any video track, you can move it wherever you want. And it's going to reflect those changes in your timeline. You can also do it with any audio track, which we've always been able to do. You can click hold and drag your audio tracks. Boom. Move it around. Makes it real handy, real easy to get organized or move tracks around in DaVinci Resolve. No longer do you need to come over to the tracks, right click, move track up, move track down. Nah, don't need to do that. Jump in the index and reorganize your tracks quicker and easier. There you have it guys. Moving video or audio tracks around easy using the index here in DaVinci Resolve 18.5 amongst a whole ton of other awesome features, which we'll be talking about and making videos about here. Getting you guys up to speed on the newest update. It is in beta. So if you're more comfortable waiting until it's the full version or full releases out, by all means wait, but if you're okay jumping on board, back up that database, jump onto DaVinci Resolve 18.5 and check out all these new features here. It's awesome. There's a ton of great stuff. Blackmagic, we love you. We love you. We love you. You guys do awesome stuff. You're always adding things that we're asking for. Subtitles, you guys see that? Automated subtitles? We'll get into that one too. But with that said guys, thanks so much for watching and we look forward to seeing you in the next one. Peace. I should make that a quick short here to back up your stuff. I could just cut it out of this, but I wanted to do that. I don't know. Quick question. I don't know why this out. All right. Let's stop and then we'll record it again.
