When it comes to audio, 32-bit flow audio is a game changer. Why might you ask? It's because we can record a huge dynamic range. Today we're going to be taking a look at the Saramonic Ultra on this side. Compared to another Saramonic mic that does not record in 32-bit float, you're going to see the difference in resolve. I'm going to show you what it looks like when we try and capture me speaking. But then we've got something loud like this quad right here, which you're going to see in a second. And 32-bit float is a game changer. And here's why. If I go ahead and fire this guy up, but we take off, this thing is loud. And you're going to be able to use the audio from my voice on the Saramonic Ultra. Whereas you're not going to be able to use that audio, it's going to peak out on the original Saramonic over here. So here we go. Here's to some noise. Check this out. Yeah, buddy. And there we go. And there we go. You've got loud audio from this machine. Still records me. Nothing's peaking with the new Saramonic Ultra here. It's pretty awesome. I'm going to tell you a little bit about it, show you how it looks in resolve. Let's get into it. I mean, I think that ought to work. What do you guys think? I think that should be kind of cool. So let's do it. So we're talking about the Saramonic Ultra, brand new microphone from Saramonic. And as an audio guy, I love me, some good audio. Love new microphones, trying them out, testing them, and just sharing them with you guys, case it's something that you're interested in. So what comes with this new Saramonic Ultra microphone? I do have some notes here, so I don't forget anything. But starting off, you've got two Ultra TX clip-on transmitters with onboard recording. So this is recording directly into here, as well as over into the camera right now. And that way you make sure you don't lose anything, right? If there's a problem with the signal back to the camera, this is going to record it internally if you turn that on. So that way you don't risk losing anything, because I've had that problem before. I've lost stuff, so I really like that it records internally. Now you also get one receiver to go on your camera, and there's a whole bunch of cool features about that I'll talk about in a minute. You also get a lightning adapter, USB-C adapter. You get a TRX cable that goes from your camera to the receiving unit over there on the camera. You've got an external antenna. Now that is huge, because how many times have you run into issues where if it's just these kind of devices with no antenna, the signal gets interrupted for some reason. There's interference or something like that. So the fact that it's got a little antenna on it, I like that. We get two omnidirectional lav mics. Now I'm just using the clip-on part right here, but you should get two lav mics with it. You should get a magnetic mount for the transmitter. So with this, there's a magnet inside my shirt, which is pretty sweet, and I can clip it on. I don't have to clip it on the top of my shirt. I can just put it with the magnet on anywhere. You have a furry windscreen, because if we're outside now, it's pretty windy, it's a little noisy. So this windscreen should be doing a pretty good job of taking care of some of that wind noise for us. You also get a little pouch, as well as a unit to put all these things in to charge them all up. So there are tons of features that come in this little system here. The big one is that it's 32-bit flow. That's going to allow us to record a wide dynamic range from things that are kind of quiet, like me talking, to things that are really loud, like the Yamaha Blaster here from 2001. So being able to record that huge dynamic range makes a big difference when you're recording. We don't have to change our levels while we're recording. You don't need to be behind the camera. We're just going to capture everything, and then we can adjust it in post, because we're going to have a huge dynamic range of audio that we can use from our clip and our recording. So you should be able to record about 130 dB of range. And that's quite a bit. That's a lot. Like, that's 130 dB is loud. You're going to know it. If you're hearing 130 dB, you probably need some earplugs. Another thing that this unit has is time code. You can sync up your time code on your camera with the microphone here. So that comes in really handy. You've got different levels of noise reduction. Now, I do have the noise reduction turned on right now. There's a little button on the unit here itself that I'm wearing. And I have that turned on. And there are several other modes there that you can choose also that give you different amounts of noise reduction. There are also several modes on the receiver that you can choose that are going to enhance your voice. So maybe you want it to sound real good out of camera. You don't want to edit your audio, which as an audio guy, come on, you got to do a little audio editing. But if you didn't want to edit any audio, you could just turn that on, and that's going to enhance the voice. This unit is also water resistant. So if you're using it outside, it happens to sprinkle a little bit. You've got nothing to worry about. It should be just fine. And not only can you plug in the receiver unit to your camera, like I have right now. It's plugged into the 5D Mark IV. You can also plug it into your phone, whether you have an iPhone. It comes with two different clips for you to be able to plug it directly in your iPhone. You can record directly in your iPhone, and you can also update the unit itself when turn on and off different features, because Saramonic has an app that you can use on your phone that allows you to be able to change all kinds of settings with the microphone. And I do really like that I can use this microphone as it is, clipped onto my shirt, like you see so many people do. Or I can plug in a lav mic to this and just use a little lav mic, and then keep this in my pocket, and then be able to have it a little more inconspicuous. I know a lot of people just use them this way, and that's fine. It works great. It sounds good, but I kind of prefer to go with the lav setup myself. But hey, to each his own, and if you want to wear it this way, that's perfectly fine. So overall, I'm really impressed with the quality of this microphone. The case it comes in is really nice. It comes with all the parts and pieces that you need. And it does a great job of recording your audio from the quiet things to the really loud things like the Yamaha Blaster here. So that way you capture everything you need. So when you get back into post, you can rock your videos, make it sound awesome. And you didn't clip into your audio. You're good to go. Let's jump into DaVinci Resolve. You can see the difference of what it looks like in Resolve between a 32-bit float recording and a recording that's not 32-bit float. And you can see the difference of where the one peaks and the 32-bit float does not peak. So let's check that out. And then we'll wrap it up out here. Individual Resolve here, when you're working with 32-bit float audio, this is what you're going to get. From the receiver, recording onto your actual video file, you're going to get 24-bit audio. And what that looks like is this right here. You can see we actually have levels that are a little loud, right? They look like they're getting cut off. And if I tried to lower down the volume, you can see sure enough, these levels are getting clipped. And here's what it sounds like. Now it's going to be loud. I'm actually going to turn this down a little bit because it's going to blow your ears off. But you're going to see that it's peaking out and it's not what we want. So I'm going to close my inspector real quick, open up my mixer so we can see our levels here. And here's what it sounds like. All right, here's some more samples. Just cruising around a little bit. You can hear the difference between the two microphones. Now it's not peaking up in my meter here because I lowered the volume, but it is getting clipped, right? Our recording could not take the volume of the audio that we're trying to record, it's getting clipped. Now when we compare that to the 32-bit float audio, this is what it looks like of the exact same situation. So we have what was getting recorded into the camera from the same microphone that we recorded internally on the microphone and got this 32-bit float file. And if I were to mute our original track and unmute this without changing the volume of it, here it's still at zero. Let me just show you here. We've got volume at zero. So how it was recorded, here's what we got. All right, here's some more samples. Just cruising around a little bit. You can hear the difference between the two microphones. One is 32-bit float, one is not. I'll show you which one is which on the screen as we go. So yeah, here's some riding, dude. Let's go. So it's loud, but you can see the 32-bit float audio or the recording captures all of that audio information. And if it looks like this, right, and it looks like it's getting clipped, when you've got that 32-bit float audio, you can come in and drop your volume down. And look, we didn't lose anything. We have all of our volume. We've got options here on making the loud parts, like with the ATV a little bit quieter if we wanted to. We can make the speaking parts a little bit louder if we wanted to, versus your regular microphones or the way that 24-bit audio works is it's just gonna cut off that audio, right? We're gonna have no information above that cutoff level, right? We're just, we're peaked out. It's cut off and we can't record anymore. So that is the benefit of 32-bit audio. And this is what it looks like in DaVinci Resolve. Now it's important to keep in mind that when you use 32-bit audio, there's a good chance you're gonna have to sync that in post in DaVinci Resolve, unless the camera that you're using can actually record in 32-bit audio, which I don't know if any can, I'm sure some can. The two that I have are older and they don't record in 32-bit audio. But if I record on device itself, right? On this guy, right? The Saramonic Ultra, this will record the 32-bit audio. And then I just sync it up in DaVinci Resolve, right? It's really like a one-click thing here. You can just open your media pool, right-click and say auto sync audio, Resolve's gonna do the rest of the work for you. It's synced up, you're gonna be good to go. So if you're interested in checking out this setup here from Saramonic, maybe you need a microphone setup like this, I'm gonna leave a link in the description below, check it out. Hope you guys found this helpful. If you've got questions on this system, feel free to drop me a comment down below. And with that said, I will see you in the next video. Peace. With that said, I would love to take this thing riding, but you know what, I don't have a trailer. So I can't really, it's kind of hard to ride and go someplace where you don't have a trailer. I just got a little bit of woods back here. It's just, it's not enough, you know what I'm saying? But this thing's fun, got it from my buddy. Thanks man, but it's a good machine. Sucker holes. Anyway, all right, I am gonna go edit this video for you and we are gonna make something cool. We'll see you, peace.
