What's happening guys we're back for another video here today. We're talking about editing to the beat in DaVinci Resolve It's gonna look a little something like this So what'd you think that was pretty cool right and it took me no time to create that so like a lot of things here in DaVinci Resolve There's more than one way to edit to the beat But the way that we're gonna look at today is pretty simple and if you're a visual person It's gonna help you visualize where those beats are and where your cuts need to go And if you haven't used the transients feature before in the Fairlight tab That's what we're gonna be using to help us edit to the beat. Now there is an awesome feature in Premiere Pro That's called something like automate to sequence I think where it lets you edit to the beat real quickly actually. I think it does most of the work for you Unfortunately, they don't have that in Resolve yet that I know of hopefully it's coming soon But the method that we're gonna look at today is pretty quick too and it really doesn't take that long today's video is sponsored by Artlist and we're gonna talk about them a little bit more in a few minutes here We're gonna jump on their website and download some music that we're gonna edit to the beat with but as I was putting this video together and editing it I decided I wanted to just show you guys the technique first And if you had questions then keep watching and we're gonna go through everything in detail But if you didn't want to stick around for all that I want to show you the technique So let's get into the technique you can see what it is and if you have questions you want to know more specifically How to use this technique stay tuned because I'm gonna go in the detail for everything once you understand the process It's really pretty quick and easy check this out. I'm gonna grab another piece of music here I don't even know what it is. It's just random I'm gonna actually just normalize it real quick because I don't want to be too loud and blow out your ears or my ears So let's see what do we got here? Okay, so got some music here now I'm gonna go through this process real quick just to show you guys how quick and easy it is So I'm gonna go ahead and duplicate the track. I'm gonna select the track EQ Gonna scroll down a little bit here in the inspector turn on band 4 I'm gonna drag that down band 1 we're gonna turn that on move that now I'm gonna listen to it isolate just that track see if I can isolate the beat a little bit more I So I think that's pretty good. I can really hear the kick drum in there I'm gonna right-click on my clip new compound clip. I don't care what we name it. So I'm just gonna hit okay I'm gonna zoom in here and now we can really see that we see a little bit more of where those beats are So I can either just edit to the beats right here. I can try my best or I'm gonna jump into fair light I'm gonna zoom in and since we already had the transient detection turned on It's just gonna appear on our tracks here and you can really see the difference here Look at this boom right there there We could see where those beats are happening versus before that you had a lot more transients going on So you can just come over here come back to the beginning. I'm gonna start right here Let's start on the second one and since our timeline settings were already set to just transients We're good to go there Select your clip and then use your up and down arrow keys to jump to the transients that you want to add the marker to Press M to add your marker and that's it. You're good to go And There you go. It's pretty quick and easy then we're gonna jump back into the edit tab here I've got my markers I can drop in my clips use the cut and ripple delete just like we did before and boom You're gonna have your video clips edited to the beat of your music So you want to make sure you've got all your assets good to go You've got your video clips you got the music you want to edit to if you're like me I'm jumping on art list here because I want to find some music if you haven't checked out art list before They are awesome. They have tons of great music new stuff getting added all the time They've got great sound effects They are the sponsor of today's video and if you haven't tried out our list I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you do sign up for an account You can use the link in the description below and you're gonna get two months for free When you sign up for a whole year. Alright, so we're on our list and I'm gonna grab a song and I actually know what song I want to get so I'm just gonna go ahead and search for it and it's called raw power So I'm gonna come up to the top here and just search for my song raw power and boom here It is the first one now I'm gonna put my headphones here so I can hear what I'm listening to but here's what this song sounds like check it out Now That's some good music right there And that's what we're gonna use to edit our clips to the beat so I'm gonna download this guy I'm gonna click on this guy right here to download again. You can use mp3 or wave whatever you want I usually use mp3's I'm gonna click that it's gonna download it and while we're here on art list some of the cool things You can do you can sort by similar kinds of songs you can make it a favorite or you can even make collections You can share a song there's so much you could do with all this stuff on here art list is I mean it's it's an awesome platform It's why I'm telling you guys about it because I want to share the things that I use that work good for me Because it's gonna work good for you too if it's something that you need and that you're interested in real quick If you're interested in the price you can pay $9.99 a month and that's gonna give you access to all of their assets And they're good on any social media platform if you need a little bit more Distribution you're putting it on TV.

Thank you art list for sponsoring today's video now We're gonna take that song jump into resolve and we're gonna edit to the beat so we're in resolve here I've got my audio in my timeline so whatever your audio is drop it in your timeline I do have my clips in here. They're ready to go in the order that I want, but we're not gonna use those yet first we need to find where the beats are and Mark them with a marker and that's gonna make our job of editing our clips to the beat a whole lot easier So right now I'm in the edit tab right here But we want to jump over into fairlight so we can use the transient detection and figure out exactly where those beats are So jump over into fairlight musical notes at the bottom here So in fairlight here We want to turn on the transient detection which is gonna kind of tells where all those beats are in the music to get to the transient Detection it's this little wavy icon right here So you want to go ahead and click on that and turn it on now you notice I don't see them popping up on my on my clip here. Why well we need to turn it on per track as well So this may be on by default it may not but if it's not right over here We have transient detection so once you turn that on you're gonna see it's gonna put those little markers in there Or the little lines I should say these aren't markers the little lines that show you visually where the beats are now It's gonna do all the beats for you You know, maybe it's the the drums the the snare drum. Maybe it's the bass guitar. It's putting all those in there together So how do we know which ones which well a few different ways you could watch it and listen to it? So you can hear the kick there, you know, it's mainly on these these bigger ones here But let's see if I scroll over where you know, the music is a little more consistent. Let's hear what that sounds like So the transients I think do a good job of telling us exactly where the beats are that we might want to edit to But let's try and get a little more precise here with our transients Let's say maybe I want to edit right to that kick drum or to the bass guitar and I don't want to worry about the other stuff Well, here's what we can do check this out. We can take our clip. We're gonna copy it down to a new track I'm just gonna hold option or alt click on my clip and drag it down to a new track Now what I want to do is select my clip and I actually want to open up the inspector So go ahead and open the inspector and we can use the EQ on our clip to help Isolate the sounds that we might want to edit to in this case, you know The kick drum or the bass guitar so I'm gonna turn on my equalizer and we're gonna take band four And we're just gonna roll this down because we don't want to know about anything. That's you know in the upper range there We're mainly looking for that low end bass or kick drum So I'm gonna play through it and what we're gonna do is bring this number point number four down And actually I can turn off point number three because we don't need that We're gonna bring point number four down until I don't hear any of those highs and then on band one here I might bring this up a little bit because I don't need any of the real low-end stuff But I still do need a little bit of low-end to kind of figure out where the beats are here So here's what we're gonna do play through it and see how it sounds and then we're gonna make adjustments to our point One in point four I'm gonna mute my first track there and let's go back to the beginning Okay, can you hear that we're mostly getting the low end now and you can hear the thud right the thud of Sounds like the bass guitar there. Let me let me listen in again So With those adjustments there on the EQ I think I can hear that the thumping of the bass and the kick drum pretty good So the next thing you want to do is actually go back into the edit tab right here Because right now nothing looks any different with our clip, right? So we want to come back in the edit tab and I'm gonna select the clip we were working with I'm gonna right-click and say new compound clip and actually before I do that Let me zoom in a little bit more here on our clip So you're gonna see the difference of what happens here So take a look at our waveforms here This is the original now take a look at what happens when I have that EQ applied and I make it a compound clip I'm gonna select my clip right-click new compound clip. They call it whatever you want doesn't matter I'm just gonna leave it as it is right now. So now look we can see where our beats are a lot more and even if we Look compare the two right we look at this, you know say this section right here We can see where those kick drums might be or the bass guitar might be so let's just isolate this one layer listen to it again All right, so I think I think what we have there is pretty much what we want is that kick drum So let's jump back into Fairlight and now I want to run the transient detection on this layer So over here on the left want to turn on the transient detection and now what do we notice when we look at the two there are less Transients in here, right and they look like they're a little more just on that Beat and especially when I scroll over to an area like this, you notice look we've got the transient right on the beats Whereas the clip before that it showed more Transients in there, right? So it's kind of a little bit closer to the beat here Now we can tweak the EQ and really isolated a little bit more if we want to you can do that too That's no problem But I think for our purposes here This is gonna be good enough and also keep in mind It's gonna depend on the song that you have because different songs obviously have you know different kind of music going in them So you're gonna have to adjust your EQ a little different based on the particular song that you're trying to edit to the beat with So now let's say I just want to put markers where those transients are How do I do that while staying in the Fairlight tab here? You want to come up to the top click on this guy and we want to adjust some of our navigation options I think by default maybe these guys are turned on you want to make sure that these three are turned off and that you've only got The transient detect turned on so this is gonna help us jump right to those transients by pressing our arrow keys So now what I want to do is I'm gonna select my clip here And I'm just gonna use my up and down arrow keys to jump from transient to transient and at each spot Because I know it's where the beat is or where that kick drum is I'm gonna put a marker and it could be really easy. You just use the letter M on your keyboard That's gonna drop a marker and you use the up and down arrows to cruise through the transients And you may need to hit the arrow once or twice because sometimes the transients are really close together So if it looks like it's you know, maybe got to move a little bit Just hit your arrow key again and it'll bump it forward to the next one now when I'm looking at these I know that most of these smaller ones that might be where the snare drum hits right? I don't want that so I want to go where the louder noise is which is gonna be the bigger wave form here So I'm just gonna always jump ahead and put a marker at the bigger wave form there So guys jumping in here real quick The reason why it's hitting what looks like to be little transients is because it's actually hitting the transients on the track above it So you got to grab that track and move it out of the way I'll show you how to do that a little later in this video But that's how you can get it so it only goes to the transients on the clip that you're working on All right back to the video Now you can add in as many of the markers here as you want depends on how many clips you have and if you're not exactly sure Where something might be happening go ahead and listen to it a little bit It's not a big deal to listen in and kind of use listening in combination with these transients to figure out Where exactly you want to put those markers? But try and get the markers as close to where you want them as you can because it's gonna make it a lot easier when we go To edit our video to it, which is actually really fast I'm adding a few more markers and then we're gonna add in our video. Alright, so I was zooming out I'm gonna gotten there and that might be good enough. So once you have your markers set We want to jump back into the edit tab So I'll go ahead click back into the edit tab and adjust my tracks here so I can see a little bit better So now is when we want to bring in our video clips So I already have mine set in the order that I want to use them So I'm just gonna select all my clips. I didn't cut these or anything I just dragged them and dropped them in the timeline in the order that I wanted to use them So I'm gonna slide these all the way back to the beginning here I'm gonna zoom in and now what we want to do is make cuts everywhere that we have a marker But not only do we want to cut the clip we want to cut and ripple delete So we want to make a cut and then delete everything after our cut for that particular clip And don't worry if it's not the exact section of the clip that you want to see I'm gonna show you how to fix that in a minute too and that's really quick and easy so I'm gonna come to the first marker here that I want to make a cut at and Ripple delete everything after it for this particular clip The one thing that you want to make sure you have set first before we make our cuts and edit to the beat here is in your audio tracks You want to make sure you turn off your audio track selector This way when we apply cuts to our clips and we ripple delete It's not going to mess up our audio tracks. It's only going to affect our video tracks So any tracks you don't want affected by this ripple delete Make sure you go ahead and turn off your auto track selector right here So now I'm going to go ahead and move ahead to my first marker Where I want to start to make a cut and then ripple delete everything after it Now don't worry if the clip isn't the exact section that you want We're going to fix that later and it's super easy For now we just want to make our cuts and delete the parts of the clip that we don't need So I've reassigned my cut and ripple delete keys to the W and the Q keys on my keyboard But to check what yours is if you come on up to trim and then you come down to ripple You're going to see start to play head and end to play head So whatever those keyboard shortcuts are that's what you want to use As you can see here I've reassigned mine to Q and W And I think that works out really good because then I have the S key as just the regular cut And not ripple delete So remember your keyboard shortcut here and that's what we're going to be using So the next important thing you want to know is how do we jump from marker to marker quickly So if you hold the shift and your arrow keys that's going to allow you to jump from marker to marker forwards or backwards depending on whether you use the up or down key So if I hold shift press down see how it jumps from marker to marker So that is going to be what makes it so quick to jump from marker to marker to edit to our beat So going back to the first one here so I'm just going to come to the first one here And now I'm going to use my ripple delete key boom I'm going to go to the next marker boom go to the next marker ripple delete And looks like I left a little space here we're going to zoom in and delete that guy I'll zoom out a little so you can see here so I'm just going to hold shift down arrow ripple delete Shift down arrow ripple delete And I'm just going to go through and do this all the way through until I use up all my clips Super quick super easy. All right, so there we go got through all my clips. I made my cuts Everything should be edited to the beat right now. So now let's take a look at what does this thing look like so far but here's the next thing that you want to do instead of using the audio track that has our markers on it where we adjusted the EQ and it's not you know the normal music We want to go ahead and mute that track and unmute our original audio So now we can go back and watch it and see what it looks like so let's take a look here and see how it looks So it looks like maybe I might want to adjust some of them there That's okay. No problem. You're probably gonna need to make a little adjustments here and there So I'll leave that up to you. You decide on your own clips whether you need to move things a little bit or not. So let's talk about how do we adjust the clips in case maybe we didn't get the exact portion of it that we wanted like in the beginning here I'm actually going to just mute this so let's zoom in the beginning here it's dark in the beginning because it just the clip just didn't start yet right so in order to adjust this I'm going to make my video tracks a little bit bigger and I'm going to come and use this tool right here the edit trim mode so when I have this selected and I come and hover over clip you'll see we get this little icon now I can just click on the clip hold and drag and adjust what I'm looking at and you can kind of see on the screen here it's got like a little white box it kind of shows me how big the clip actually is and I can just keep adjusting it until it's wherever I want it to be so let's say I want it to be right there maybe bring it over a little more let's try like that I'm going to fade the clip in a little bit and here's what it looks like not too shabby not say maybe I want to make this clip longer I want it to be you know two widths or two beats right so it's a little bit longer we can see what's happening in the beginning here another easy thing we can do option or all why it's going to select all my clips in front of my playhead and then I'm just going to click on them and drag them over until I get to this next marker right here and then I can just grab this clip and extend it out so let's turn on our music and see how this looks all right not too bad right and now I did notice that this joint right here maybe I want to move that one over to like here about and I think that would be good yeah that definitely works better so that is it for this one guys a big thank you to Artlist for sponsoring today's video dude editing to the beat is awesome it makes your videos look better instead of just random cuts when you have the music going you got to edit to the beat it just makes your videos look cooler come on let's be honest so if you guys are interested in Artlist check out the link in the description below you'll get two months for free if you sign up for a year and with that said guys thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next video peace
