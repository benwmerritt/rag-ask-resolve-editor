We are an organization making singers female producers. Are you dreams doctors in their province? The So I just got in the HD8 ISO, we have it right here. I'm just gonna run over like the big, high level basics of this board. And then maybe we'll get into it in some more detail after we start working with it. So I can give you a little bit more input on how we're using it and exactly what we're doing with any of like the specific settings and things like that. So let's just take a look at the overall board here. It's probably about 18 inches or so long. It has a nice little, you know, front piece here with the screen on it, which is really nice. And let's just take a look at all the different little sections here that we have of this board real quick. So I'm grabbed a GoPro here so I can show you real quick. So this first section right up here, we have various buttons here. We've got some dim buttons to lower the volume. We have a mute button, different speaker buttons, a way to use a talking headset. If you have a headset that's connected to other people in your production, you can send sound to the studio monitors here. If you have a monitor setup that you can listen to. So that's kind of some basics of volume control, talking with other people, communicating and that kind of stuff. There's a call button on there that'll flash the little light on one of your black magic cameras if you've got one of those. So that can come in handy to get the camera person's attention if you need to. The next section right over here has a whole bunch of different stuff in there. We've got our home button here. We've got different settings. We have ways to scroll through our screen here. So if I just hit this button here, I'm sorry if I hit settings first and then I hit these little buttons here, I can scroll through the different menus on our screen. We can go through all of our different settings, use different frame rates. We can do any 1080, 60, 30. We can change it to whatever we want it to be. You can do different types of transitions right up in here. We have different media players and borders and different ways to communicate. We can set up macros. This is essentially all of your settings for everything on the board. In the middle here, we've got our screen which shows us exactly what we wanna see, tells us our different menus and our options and things like that. In the next section over here, we've got our numbers and you could just punch in different things into the screen here for like your frame rate or different things you might need to punch in a number four. So you can do that right there. There's also nice toggle buttons here that's roll back and forth. It got a great feel to it. I mean, the overall build of this whole thing is really solid. I mean, it's pro level stuff right here. This next section right here is kind of what we're gonna be using to do all of our switching and controlling our audio. So if we take a look at the top right up here, we've got different cameras and our different inputs. We can work with our levels. We can solo different inputs. We can select them. We can also come over here and we've got different buttons where we can use our levels. We can use pan controls, EQ controls, expander controls, compressor controls, limiters, gates, and then camera controls. If you're using black magic design cameras, you can come in here and select the different camera options that you might wanna adjust like your color, your zoom, your iris, your gain, all that kind of stuff. So you've got a lot of options there. If you're using black magic cameras, if you're just using other cameras or PTZs like we are, those aren't gonna do anything for you. But if you've got the whole black magic setup, those are gonna do a great job for you. Plus you've got all of your audio controls right over there, which work out really well. The next section right down in here is where we're gonna be doing all of our switching. So if we take a look at the different rows here, so this top row will be our macros and some other options there. If I hit our macro button, we can set up recordings or macros for this board to play back for us. So that's how you would select those. Below that we've got a screen that shows us what our different inputs are. We can select the output, whatever is currently getting streamed out to the world, is gonna be in this top row here and it'll show up as red. We can just hard cut to our different angles or we can use our transition. So we can say, okay, I want this angle to be up next. And currently it's on this one. I want it to go to the green one. Then I can either use the T bar here to make that transition or I can just hit the auto button and it's gonna automatically fade between the two for us. So this is your main section that you're gonna be using when you're running your live broadcast, right? We're gonna be switching angles. I'm gonna say, okay, change it. And like I said, you can use the T bar if you want or you can use the auto button. There's also a cut button here that's just a hard cut from one camera to the next. If you just want a hard cut, you can do that too. If you wanna have access to more channels, you can hit the shift button that's right here. And when you hit that shift button, you're gonna get different options coming up on the screen here. So I've got black color bars, different colors. You've got super source, media player keys. You can just set up a whole bunch of different kinds of custom things on this board. The next section right up here is our aux section buttons. So we can set up different auxes, different auxiliary inputs and outputs. You can change back and forth in between the two. It's gonna give you some information on the screen here. Select your different inputs, which is also gonna correspond to our section down over here where you would see all the different outputs that you have for your system. So you've got your program, your previews, and your source selections all down here. So if I select one of my aux buttons, it's gonna correspond down here with the camera buttons. And you can also select your aux one, your aux two. You can have different inputs, lot of different connectivity options on this thing. You can route things wherever you want. It's got different ways to do all kinds of stuff, which is really cool. But this is just high level right now on the kinds of things that you can do with this board. The next little section right here is all of our different keyers, right? We've got different kinds of keys we can do here. If we wanted to run our macros that we might have recorded between changing angles and doing different things, we could hit our macro on. We've got our different keys, our key one, two, three, and four, you can turn them on by hitting the on button, and then it's gonna turn it on for us. You can turn it off by hitting the on button again. And you can change your keys. You can have multiple keys on at a time. There's a lot of options there on how you can work with the keys. The next little section we have down here is our DVE and transitions. So we can have different types of transitions. There's dips, we've got our DVE, Sting, a mix of the transition, a wipe. You've got a lot of different options here, and you can set all this inside of the software, as well as in the menu that's up here on the board itself. You can change the type of transition, lot of options again on anything, however you wanna customize it really, you can do whatever you want. We've got our cut and our auto button here to change our angles or change our cameras from our settings over here. You've got the T-bar that you can do it fast or slow. You can change it however you want. Up in the top section over here, we have a bunch of different buttons. These are our stream and record options. Now we can record directly into this board because this is the ISO version of the HD8. And once we make a purchase, we're probably just gonna go with the regular standard HD8. But if you want to record internally on this board, you can. We have the ability to grab a still from our output. We have the ability to record. We can stop, switch, we can go on Air Live if you have this hooked directly up to the internet and you're set up to stream from it. You can stream right from this guy. And from what I hear, it does a pretty good job at it. When you wanna go off air, you just hit off. And then it's gonna go ahead and take it off air. The last section down over here is our downstream keyers. We have a downstream keyer one and a downstream keyer two. You can turn them both on. They'll put different overlays on the screen for you. In our case, we're gonna be using it for some words to a song. So that's gonna be one of our downstream keyers. And I'll show you that more once we get it all set up. And finally, we have our fade to black button over here. It'll just fade the entire stream to black. And then if you hit it again, it'll fade it back up. So when you wanna end your stream, if you wanna do a fade to black, you could do that. So that's a quick overview of what's going on here. There's a lot more here that I don't know that I'm gonna dig into a little bit more as we get this guy set up and start working with it. I wanna record on it, see how it works. I wanna take the recording from here, which will record all of our source inputs. And then I wanna bring that into DaVinci Resolve. And then the cool part is that it will also create a DaVinci Resolve file that has all the cuts in it for us based on our live stream switching. So whatever was actually getting sent out, it will allow us to have that as a DaVinci Resolve timeline. I believe once we get into Resolve. So I'm really curious to try that out, see how that all works out. Oh, and then on the back here, I mean, we've got tons of connectivity, all kinds of different connections here, SDIs, INS, Outs. We've got multi views to hook up to monitors so you can see what you're doing with this thing. You've got XLR inputs, you've got talk outputs, all kinds of good stuff back there, as well as a bunch of ethernet ports that you got there. So lots of different kinds of connectivity there for this board. So I know that was a real quick, high level look at this thing. If you've got questions, leave a comment down below. But that's where we're gonna wrap it up on this one for today. And I'm gonna go over actually tomorrow after I'm filming this and get this guy installed. And then we're gonna try it out. And once I have a chance to try it out for a little while, I'm gonna make a video over there at my church, just talking about how it's working out and kind of maybe some different things we can set up and just wanna see what kind of cool features we can use that come as part of this HD8 ISO model. So this thing is great. Thanks so much, Blackmagic for sending it out. Let us give it a try. And we're gonna be making a purchase here, you know, in a few weeks, but it's nice to give this one a try and see how it all works out before we go ahead and make that purchase.
