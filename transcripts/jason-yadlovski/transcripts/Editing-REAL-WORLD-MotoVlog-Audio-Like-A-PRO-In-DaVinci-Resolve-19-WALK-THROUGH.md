When do they think it's gonna rain? More cows light up? Did they just have a big night last night or something? I know it's still on a field a couple of miles back, they were all, well, three-quarters of them were lying down as well. I know they think it's gonna rain. More cows light up. Did they just have a big night last night or something? I know it's still on a field a couple of miles back there. You saw the before and after of how we made our audio go from, eh, not so good, to pretty good where we can clearly understand what the rider is saying. Today we're taking a look at a real-world example here of some audio that I got from one of our viewers out there. He's got a motorcycling channel where he cruises around and does a little commentary on top of riding around. And he was just looking for some tips on how to make it sound better. So the tips I'm going to give you in this video can work for anything. So even if you don't motorcycle, you probably want to check this one out anyway. So let's jump in resolve and I'm going to show you how we can get this all set up and sound in green. So here's what we got. He was actually able to send me the timeline as well as the clip that goes along with the video. Now he's got a pretty decent setup. He says he's got a DJI mic with one channel that records the exhaust note of the motorcycle and then another channel of audio that records him speaking. So we're going to take a look at the timeline that he sent me and see how we can improve it a little bit. So let's just give it a quick listen here. You heard the before and after there in the beginning, but here's what it sounds like just going over a few pieces of the audio here. So right off the bat, the motorcycle is way too loud, right? We can't even hear the dialogue. And in the dialogue here, I noticed there's an effect on there. So let's see what effect we have on the clip itself. Effects, it's got the dialogue processor on there. So that's fine. You can use the dialogue processor that'll work fine for you. But in this case, let's just work with the dialogue first. So I'm going to go ahead and mute the motorcycle track. And then I'm going to play through. Let's hear what the dialogue sounds like without the motorcycle track. When do they think it's going to rain? More cows like that. Did they just have a big night last night or something? All right. So it's very choppy, right? As the audio comes in and out, right? So I want to fix that. And I'm probably just going to use some basic fades to do that. But the other thing that I'm thinking is maybe I want to try and reduce the sound of the motorcycle a little bit, even though it's going to be in the background there, just so we can hear the dialogue a little bit clearer. And just to see what we have actually in these clips, if I extend this out, I'm just curious what's in there. Okay, we can see. So it's basically cut up so he was able to get rid of the motorcycle sound in between where he's speaking. So that works out fine. But I think what I would do in this case, let's just say that I'll leave that dialogue processor effect on these clips. Let's add a little voice isolation if you've got the studio vision here, just to bring down that background noise a little bit. So I'm going to select my track three, and we're going to turn on the voice isolation. I'm going to pop out our little voice isolation window. Now, I don't think we need it at 100%. So I'm going to drag this down. Let's start at maybe 10% and see how that sounds. I think that's better. Let me loop this. I'm going to set an endpoint and an out point. I'm going to hit my loop button here. And let's just play it over and again, and over and over again. And we're going to see how the voice isolation makes a difference on the clip. Let's start at zero, and then we'll just bring it up as we're listening. I'm going to go with it around 40 right now. I believe I have 40. I think that's pretty good. It just brings down that motorcycle sound in the background a little bit. So I like that. And now what I might do is actually extend out these clips a little bit, because we want to fade them in and fade them out. So I'm going to clear my in and out points by using option or alt X. And if I zoom in on this particular clip, I could try just fading it where the clip is. Just add a couple frame fade. Let's see how that sounds. All right, so that's better. It sounds a little smoother. But what I could do also is extend the clip a little bit and just make that fade a little bit bigger so I can just drag out the clip a little bit, make that fade a little bit longer. And I'm going to want to go ahead and do that to each one of these clips. Let's say we add, I don't know, a six frame fade there. We'll do it on all of them, six frames, and we'll extend the clip out a little bit. So that way it's at full volume by the time the writer is talking about six frames. And depending on your clip, you know, you may need to do it more frames. Maybe less. It just depends on your particular clip, how it's sounding, and the results that you want. All right, so we got our clips there. So let's just hear how they kind of fade in and out. When do they think it's going to rain? More cows like that. Did they just have a big night last night or something? Okay. I noticed it on a field a couple of miles back. I think that sounds better. Now, if you're using a technique like this, you could, since we're using the voice isolation, if I were to just copy this down into its own track, you could just extend this out. And in theory, where the voice isolation is being used, you know, the motorcycle in the background here should stay at a pretty quiet volume. And it really wouldn't conflict too much with the other motorcycle sound that you have from the exhaust note up here. So you could do it that way too. Instead of cutting up all these clips, it would probably work just fine. And matter of fact, we could just try it real quick. If I just mute our other dialogue, let's unmute our track where we didn't make any cuts on it. And I'm just going to turn on the voice isolation. I'm going to set it to 40% like on the other track. And let's just hear how that sounds. When do they think it's going to rain? More cows like that. Did they just have a big night last night or something? I noticed it on. So I might do that. I might just leave the clip all the way long and then just adjust my voice isolation a little bit. Instead of going through and making all the cuts, you know, save yourself some time, because it's probably not going to make a huge difference in this kind of video. So I probably just do the voice isolation and you can even use a little bit of the expander on there to help bring down the parts where you're not talking, which we'll take a look at in a second here. But let me mute that track for now. We'll go back to the cut up clips right here. So now we're sounding pretty good, but our next problem that we need to deal with is the volume of our motorcycle clip here. So that's pretty loud. And let's just give it a listen here. It's just way too loud. It's almost peaking out. So what I would do is I would make sure that my dialogue is around that minus 10 dB. So let's just double check that. I should have checked that right when I started, but it's all right. All right. So I think they're okay. But for our motorcycle here, I'm almost going to treat it like it's music, right? And I want to think about my levels when I'm working with music, or in this case, the motorcycle sound. I probably want it to be lower than the dialogue. So I'm going to bring it down to maybe minus 15 dB. If I hold my shift key, I can get a little more precise there. Let's just stick it out of minus 15 and see how that sounds on solo or track. What do they think it's going to rain? More cows like that. And that's pretty close. I think that's in a decent spot. I might use my fader now just to fine tune it a little bit. But one other thing we could try is to spread out that sound a little bit instead of having to come directly down the middle channels and compete with our dialogue. So if we jump over in a fair light, musical notes at the bottom here, what we can do is add a little space to it, right? We want to spread everything out. So if you've seen my videos about adding music behind dialogue, you've probably heard this tip before, but on our track number one, we're going to go ahead and add an effect. We're going to come down to spatial, fair light effects, and stereo width. Now you can just select the preset here. I'm going to go max separation. And let's see if we can hear a difference on that. I'm going to turn it off, then turn it on. Okay, in this case, it's not really making too much of a difference. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it doesn't. I don't really notice too much of it doing anything in this particular clip. So that's okay. No problem. Sometimes it'll work. Sometimes it won't. Depends on your clip, but give it a try. The next thing that you could do is just so it's not competing too much with the dialogue, a little bit of EQ work, right? So I'm going to delete this effect. I'm going to change this, even though probably it doesn't really matter. I'm going to go EQ dynamics effects. And then we're just going to open the EQ. And I want to add a little cut in the 800 to 2k range. So I'm just going to grab 0.4, drag it down a little bit, spread it out with my middle mouse wheel here. And that's it. Here's a little before and after. You can hear it just pulls a little bit of it out, and that makes a little space for our dialogue to sit in there. So I'm happy with that. I think that's pretty good. Now, the dialogue, so the dialogue's not too bad. Let's hear it all together. What do they think it's going to rain? More cows, like that. Did they just have a big night last night or something? And I was on a field a couple of miles back, they were all, well, three cores, and then we're lying. Not bad, not bad. I think we're getting there, right? Now, I did lower down my motorcycle track a little bit. So I'm going to call this exhaust, just to kind of keep track of everything. Track three is going to be dialogue. So now the thing that I would like to do here, even though we already do have the voice, I'm sorry, not the voice, the dialogue processor on here. You can use this, no problem, that's fine. But in this case, I do notice that the dialogue kind of fluctuates a lot with our levels when I'm watching our meters over here. So I'm actually just going to use some of the dynamics right here in the mixer, so that we can kind of balance that out a little bit. So let me play through part of this. We're going to set I for an in point, O for an out point. We're going to make sure our looping icons turned on. And I'm just going to work with the dynamics on here. And what that's going to do is just make the audio sound more consistent. Instead of there being kind of loud parts and kind of quiet parts, it's just going to bring them a little bit closer for us. So I'm going to double click on my dynamics. The other thing you might want to do real quick, just change those to, I always go EQ dynamics and effects. Let's just play through it. We're going to turn on our dynamics, turn on our compressor, use the compressor a little bit, use the makeup a little bit and see how it works out. And I want to be watching my meters, because that's what's going to tell me whether it's hitting the levels that I want it to hit. All right. So that's pretty good. And you know, my levels are getting back up around that minus 10 dB. It's a little more consistent instead of fluctuating a lot. So I'm liking that. Now, one other thing that I could try on the dialogue channel here is just to turn on the expander so that those parts that are a little bit quieter, where we hear the motorcycle in between where he's speaking, or underneath him, get a little bit quieter, a little bit quicker. So we can just turn on the expander. I'm going to increase the ratio a little bit here. And I don't know, let's see if that helps. It's going to rain. More cows lying down. Did they just have a big night last night or something? I noticed they on a field a couple of miles back, they were all, well, three-quarters of them were lying down as well. So now you can still kind of hear a bunch of that background noise in there on the dialogue. So in this case, I might want to turn up the voice isolation a little bit, right? Because it kind of sounds like, you know, you hear that extra background noise coming in when they're speaking happening. So I'm going to click on my dialogue track. Let's just bring our voice isolation up. I don't know, let's try 60 and see how that works. More cows lying down. Did they just have a big night last night or something? I noticed they on a field a couple of miles back, they were all, well, three-quarters of them were lying down as well. When did they? All right, so I think that's a little better. I brought up the exhaust note a little bit, and the dialogue, I brought it down just a touch. And I think that is helping make it sound a whole lot better. So let's clear out our in and out points here, using the Option ROLL X. And I just want to play through these last two clips and see how that's sounding. I noticed it on a field a couple of miles back, they were all, well, three-quarters of them were lying down as well. Must have been cow fest or something yesterday. All right, so that's not bad. I think that sounds pretty decent. I don't know, what do you guys think? Comment down below. Want to hear what you're thinking. So I'm curious what this sounds like without the effect on there. So I'm just going to turn that off real quick. Let's go ahead and turn off Dialog Processor. And let me play through, see what that sounds like. I noticed it on a field a couple of miles back, they were all, well, three-quarters of them were lying down as well. Okay, I mean, it's not too bad. It's a little bit muffled. I mean, I'm probably just do a little regular EQ work on there. And just so you guys could see what I would do, let's just do it real quick. Again, you can use that Dialog Processor, that's perfectly fine. But if I wanted to use a little EQ, let's see what I would do here. Okay, and plugin function also on here. Three-quarters of them were lying down as well. I noticed it on a field a couple of miles back. They were all three-quarters of them were lying down as well. I noticed it on a field a couple of miles back. They were all, well three-quarters of them were lying down. I noticed it on a field a couple of miles back. They were all, well, three-quarters of them were lying down as well. I noticed it on a field a couple miles back. They were all well. and also a profit aarin below a do with a little bit of EQ there and let's just, we'll just turn off the effect. I'm going to leave it on there because I'm actually going to send this file back so that they can take a look at it, kind of see what I did, see how it works out, follow along with this video. And again, like I said, you could use just this track with that voice isolation on there. If we were to mute what we just did, let's see how this sounds. Now I think I'm going to need to crank up the voice isolation to 60, just like I did on the other clips here, but let's just hear that. What do they think it's going to rain? More cows like that? Did they just have a... And actually let's just copy over my settings here from the dynamics. I'm going to do copy, select it, paste. What do they think it's going to rain? More cows like that? Did they just have a big night last night or something? I noticed it on a field a couple of miles back, they were all well, three cores and that were lying down as well. Now so I would almost say that it sounds better if you were to do it this way down here, leave that clip long, use the voice isolation to knock back the motorcycle sound in there and just bring out the dialogue. So I would say you don't get those up and down fluctuations as much. So I think I might even just do it like this here with the track number four and it's going to save you some time. You don't have to cut this all apart. But you know what? There's options. You can do things different ways in resolve here. A lot of different ways that you can do things. So what do you think? Is it better? Is it worse? How did it come out to you? What do you think? Happy to hear your comments down below and if you've got some audio, some real world audio that you want me to look at and try and see what we could do with it and make it sound better, happy to take a look at it. I do have a link that used to work for my real world audio edit series. I'll leave that down below. I got to check that out, make sure it's still working so you guys can send stuff in there. But a fun little edit here. Hope this was helpful for you guys to see how to kind of work with things a little bit and in this case, get the Motovlog thing sounding pretty good.
