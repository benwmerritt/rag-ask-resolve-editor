If you want to get your work done a little bit quicker here in DaVinci Resolve in 2025, I've got a few copy and paste power tricks that are going to help you speed up your workflow. Welcome to the first video of 2025 here. Happens to be a quick tip Tuesday. My name is Jason Niedlowski and let's just jump in to DaVinci Resolve. We are going to start off in the edit tab here. That's where I do most of my work. Now the first copy and paste power trick is this. You can copy and paste attributes. So for example, on this clip right here, I just made a few changes in my inspector. I tweaked it a little bit, scaled it a little bit, did just a few things and it looks like this. Now I want my other clips to have the exact same attributes as this first clip right here. And this is what it kind of looks like. Did you really not hit record? Hate when I don't hit record. So first thing you need to do, select your clip. You want to command or control C to copy that clip or you can come up to the edit menu and come down to copy right here. Then you want to select either one or both or however many clips you have that you want to paste those attributes to. Now you can't just hit command or control V because what happens is it'll actually just paste in the clip at the playhead. What you need to do is use your option on a Mac or alt on a PC plus the letter V. So select my clips option or alt letter V. We're going to get this window right here, which is paste attributes and we can select any of these attributes to copy and paste if we want to. Now I'm going to come up here and choose just the video attributes. I'm not going to worry about the audio attributes right now. I'm going to hit apply. And now when we jump down in our timeline, each one of our video clips are going to have the exact same attributes as this one right here and it's going to include anything that you had on there. And just looking at this window again, you can even include things like retime process changes, motion estimation changes, fusion effects, color corrections and other plugins that you might have on the video clip. So it makes it real fast and easy to just copy and paste your attributes from one clip to a ton of other clips. Now when it comes to your audio, we can also copy and paste there. Now you've got a few options here in my audio track number two right here. You can see if I look at my mixer, I do have some effects, a multiband compressor, I did a little dynamics and a little bit of EQ. Now if we wanted to copy all of these to a new track, again, we can right click. You can come down to copy attributes for the entire track, we can select our new track, right click and come down to paste attributes, you'll get your paste attributes window, you can select all of the attributes if you want to or you can only select the ones that you want to copy from one track to the next. Now another power tip here if you wanted to copy and paste an entire track, you could just right click on an audio track, come down to duplicate track right here, and you have a copy of the exact same track. Now you might not need your audio clips in there so you can delete them but you'd have a track with all of the exact same settings. Either way works and it's really quick to do it both ways. Another copy and paste power trick here is if you wanted to copy or paste only one element in your mixer, you could just right click, copy, go to your new track, right click, paste. Boom, you can paste over your EQ dynamics the same way. If you want to copy and paste in effect, all you have to do is hold your option or alt key, click hold and drag your effects onto another track real fast, real easy just to copy around things that you use really often. You can also make presets but we'll talk about that in a different video. Jumping into the color tab here, we can copy and paste our color grades really fast and easy between clips and you want to have a three button mouse here because that's the easiest way to do it. If you don't, I'm going to show you how you can do it anyway if you're on a laptop or have a track pad or something like that but I have one clip right here that's already graded and then I've got two more clips right here where you can see we've copied and pasted our attributes. All I have to do if I want to match the grade from this clip to this clip is select the clip I want the grade applied to, hover my mouse over the clip that already has the grade and middle click my mouse and boom, all of the nodes are copied from one clip onto the next clip and you can select multiple clips so I can select these two clips and then just middle click my mouse on the clip I want to copy the attributes from or the color grade from and boom, there you go. You've applied the color grade really quick and easy little copy and paste power trick right there. Now if you don't have a three button mouse, you can still do the exact same thing. Process is slightly different so select your video clip you want to apply the color grade to, hover your mouse over the clip you want to copy your color grade from and then you're going to right click and you're going to come down to either apply grade or append grade so apply grade is just going to overwrite anything you may have on that second clip that you want to apply the grade to so if you have nothing on there go ahead and hit apply grade but if you wanted to add the nodes onto the end of something that you've already color graded you would apply append grade so in this case I'm going to say apply grade boom there we go we've copied over our clip if you don't have a middle mouse button and can't forget about the fusion page to copy and paste a little power trick in there super easy just select the nodes that you want commander control c click outside of there commander control v boom you've copied over your nodes and you can go ahead and continue working and make whatever you want without having to redo nodes individually first quick tip tuesday in the books here guys a little copy and paste power tricks here in DaVinci Resolve 19 these couple tips are just going to speed up your workflow in the various tabs here they come in handy I use them all the time and hopefully you guys find this helpful too all right with that said I'm gonna wrap up this first video here if you want to see something special you got ideas comment down below happy to hear it and make videos about it I want to make what you guys want to see and as always I do have an audio course if you're interested in leveling up your audio here in 2025 I recently just updated it and added some new sections in there so if you already have the course you can jump in there they're free check them out and if you didn't pick up the course yet well now you've got a few extra things that you can learn there in the course that are already built in they're thrown in there and we'll just keep you learning we're gonna keep adding to it and making it better and better for all future versions of resolve here so level up your audio in 2025 all right guys with that said I'm out of here I'm going to make some more videos for you and I will see you in the next video peace
