We are back for another audio tutorial here in DaVinci Resolve. It allows me some good audio and you guys should too. Today we have a little tip here that allows you to change the audio level or the volume of a particular clip in the media pool. You don't have to drop it in the timeline, change it clip by clip and adjust your volume there. We can do it right in the media pool for the entire clip so that way any piece of that clip that you bring into your timeline, boom, it's good to go. You've got good audio levels. You don't have to go clip by clip and make adjustments. So let's jump into resolve and check this out. I'm in DaVinci Resolve here currently in the edit tab and all I have to do is come over and open up my media pool, select the clip that I want to adjust the volume for before I even bring it into my timeline. Then I'm going to go ahead and open up my inspector and now I can just adjust my volume right here and it's going to adjust it on the clip. So if we play through it here is how loud it is currently. The entire clip right here in the media. Let's say I need to make that louder. Be a pool real quick and real easy. Here's how you do it. Boost our volume up a little bit. How's that sound? Those are a little too low and we can turn up the sounds good. Now if I just take my clip, drop it into my timeline, take a listen, a little too low and we can turn up the entire pretty good. Right. And if we click on it, we can see in the inspector that clip is still has that volume of 12.14 that I adjusted it to. So you can do this in the edit tab in Fairlight and in the media pool. Now, why might you want to do it in the media pool? Let's jump in there and I'll show you why. So once you're in the media tab, you want to go ahead and open up your audio section here as well as your inspector. So if I click on my clip in the media pool that I want to look at, which is this guy, I'm going to play through it. Now I've reset the volume here to zero and we can watch our levels up here by watching the meters. So let's see where it's currently at. Can turn up the entire clip right here in the media pool. So that's pretty low, right? Minus 25 dB. We want to boost that up a little bit. So I'm going to come back to the beginning clip and I'm just going to boost up my volume in my inspector and then I'm going to watch the meters to make sure it's in a good spot. So here we go. Sometimes our levels are a little too low and we can turn up the entire clip right here in the media pool. It's real quick and real easy. So there we go. We're getting up to about that minus 10 dB. So now I know my levels are set so I can jump back into the edit tab. I'm going to bring it back into my timeline again and if I click on the clip, you can see my volume here is still at 15.11. So I've been able to easily increase the volume of the entire clip without bringing it into the timeline, cutting it all up and then having to go back clip by clip and make adjustments. So it's just one of those little things that's going to help speed up your workflow here in the ventures of while you're creating some videos. There you have it changing volume in the media pool. Handy. It's quick. It's easy, especially if you recorded your levels a little bit low on your audio and you need to boost the whole clip up anyway. That's a great way to do it.
