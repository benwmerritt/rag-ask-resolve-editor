It's Quick Tip Tuesday and I'm gonna show you how you can quickly and easily create that flicker effect that you just saw. Let's jump into Resolve. So I am in DaVinci Resolve here. I've got a little project that I've been working on and I want that flicker effect, right? I had an idea to create it with the music as you saw in the beginning there and here's how we're gonna do it. It's super easy and right here in my timeline, these purple clips, that is the flicker effect. So let's just zoom in here and how can we create it? Well, we just use a solid color generator to create the flicker effect. Really quick and easy. So, in order to do it, we're gonna come up to our effects library. I'm gonna open this guy up a little bigger here. We're gonna come down to Generators and right here we have Solid Color Generator. So I'm gonna click that and drag it down into my timeline. I'm gonna just put it on a new track up here. Now when you drag in the solid color generator, it's gonna be a little bit big. I don't know how many seconds this is, but we wanna make it really short so that way we can create a flicker effect by using multiple clips of the solid color. So I'm gonna drag this guy back and what I like to do is make it maybe one, definitely one, maybe two frames. You could go two at most and to do that, I'm just gonna use my arrow keys. So let's say we did two frames. I'm gonna make the solid color only two frames long and if I play through it real quick, you're gonna see it's gonna create a little flash on the screen. Check it out. So the trick to creating the flicker effect where it goes on for a little bit is to just copy this clip and space them out evenly or however you want. So in this case, I'm gonna click the option key on a Mac or alt key on a PC, click hold and drag, boom, I got a copy. Now what I like to do is set these maybe two frames apart to start. So I'm gonna just go ahead two frames. Gonna drag this guy over and I'm gonna do that again. Copy my clip and come to the end go over two frames, drag back that and I'm gonna do this a few times, right? You can do it as many times as you want depends on how long you want the effect to go on. So once you get a couple of them, I can just copy all three, boom and now I got six of them come to the end, make sure I'm only going ahead two frames there and now that I've got a few frames here, let's see how that's looking. All right, not too bad, not too bad. And let's say I wanted to speed up, right? I want it to look like it's getting faster, a faster flicker, right? Which is what I did with our clips over here. So to do that, what you're gonna do is again, take this clip, I'm gonna copy it and now what we wanna do is only put one frame in between each one of the clips. So I'm just gonna move ahead one, move this guy over, we're gonna make another copy here, move ahead one frame, move this back. I'm gonna do this a couple times here just so I can get the effect that I want. Once you get a few of them, we can copy those and bump it over a frame. Now one trick here, if you are selecting a bunch of them here and you wanna move those clips one frame, you can use your period and comma keys to just bump it one frame, right? So that's probably actually a whole lot easier than using the arrows because I just did that and I'm like, hey, you guys should know that because it makes it a whole lot easier. So let's say I'm gonna just throw in another, I don't know, that many of them gonna hold option or alt, copy it over, period key, boom, done. And here is what it looks like with our flicker effect. Okay, so we're getting the job done there of creating the flicker effect. Now here's the one that I created and what I did underneath that because it kinda went with the music was to fade out the clip of the person riding on the horse. So here's what that looks like. So I think that works out cool. Now it would have been probably even better if I lined it up with the drum beats that you just heard there. But one other thing that you can do to kinda create and sell this effect a little bit is to add a whoosh every time we get a little flash on the screen here. So I'm gonna come back to my media pool. I do have a little whoosh sound effect here, so I'm gonna drag this down and I do have some audio tracks here for sound effect. So I'm gonna stick my little whoosh in the sound effects track. I'm gonna make it a little bit smaller here. Now if I had a faster whoosh it might even be better and I may have a faster one. Let's take a quick look. Alright, I'm not finding one that I have that shorter so we're just gonna make this work for what we need it for. So I'm gonna slide this guy a little bit. I'm gonna bump it frame by frame here. I'm actually gonna make it a little bit shorter here. I'm gonna fade it in and fade it out a little bit. And now what I'm gonna do is just copy this between my audio effects tracks to help sell the effect of the flicker. Now you can play with it a little bit to see exactly where you want it to line up. Well, let's say I'm gonna just eyeball them kinda like this and then as they get faster I'm gonna put them a little bit closer together and once we add in the sound effects I might actually drop the volume on these guys just a little bit so they're not too loud. We'll drop them back a little bit. Here's what that effect looks like once you add in the sound effects. Check this out. Alright, so a little loud there. We should drop those back in volume a little bit more and you can change them and have them be a little bit different too but it's kind of a cool effect here that we can use to add on top of our flicker effect here to help sell the whole thing. And here it is with the volume lowered a little bit. Check this out real quick. If I select all these guys I can right click and say new compound clip. I'm gonna say flicker. Boom. I've got a compound clip that now shows the flicker and now I can copy that compound clip wherever I want and use it whenever I want. We can even save it for another project if we want to do that. So that wraps up this flicker effect guys. Hope you found it cool, a little helpful. If you did let me know. Drop a comment down below.
