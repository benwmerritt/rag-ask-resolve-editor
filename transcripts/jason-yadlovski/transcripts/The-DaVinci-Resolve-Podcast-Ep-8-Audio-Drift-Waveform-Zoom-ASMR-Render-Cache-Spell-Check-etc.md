## Transcript
Welcome to the DaVinci Resolve podcast guys. I am Jason Nielowski. Sometimes I go by Jay, but it's a podcast where I answer the questions that you have left on my channel, on my videos about DaVinci Resolve. We get in there and just give myself a chance to kind of talk through some of the issues that you guys have a little bit more because it's easier to talk about it sometimes than it is to just jump in there and leave a comment on YouTube. So I've gone through and pulled out a bunch of comments from you guys that we're going to talk about today and got a bunch of them. And you know what? We got to get back into doing the podcast here because not only is it helpful for you guys, I enjoy doing it. It's another way that we can connect and that I can help you guys learn, resolve a little bit better. Maybe you can listen on the go. You can watch the video if you want. You've got options here on how you can continue to learn DaVinci Resolve. And honestly, by me answering your questions, it helps me learn Resolve better too, because sometimes I need to do a little research to figure things out and answer questions for you guys. So let's just get right into it. The first question that we have here is from Victor on the audio sync fixes and no waveform fix video that I have out. He says, what if my audio is two hours? And at the end of my video, I see audio drift, especially when I do multi cam editing. How do I solve that problem? So the reason that you're having some drift in your videos, and I've dealt with this before too, is because you may have different frame rates for your particular video clips. For example, and they may be off just a little bit slightly. And I'm talking like one is at 30 frames per second and one is at 29.97. And I had that exact problem. My screen recordings that I was doing for a long time were at 30 frames per second. And that's how I brought the video into DaVinci Resolve. But when I recorded off my camera, it was at 29.97. I couldn't get exactly 30. So when I exported them and brought them in, yeah, they'd line up great in the beginning. But then as we went along in the video, you would get that little bit of drift. And for a long time, the way that I dealt with it was I would just have the videos synced up until the drift was kind of noticeable. I'd make a little cut, and then I'd bump the audio clip to the, you know, the right or the left a little bit just to re-sync things up. And then it would be good for another little while down the timeline. Then I'd have to make another cut, bump it over again. And you can use the keys comma and period on your keyboard to just bump an audio clip or a video clip for that matter, right and left one frame. So it makes it really easy to line things back up. But that's what I used to do until I realized that from my screen recording program, I can actually export at 29.97. And now everything lines up perfectly. It works out awesome. So my camera that I'm filming on now the C 100 Mark II films at 29.97. My exported screen recording is also at 29.97. So now they sync up perfectly and resolve. But you are going to get a little bit of that drift if your frame rates don't match exactly. And make sure that your timeline frame rate matches your talking head frame rate as well. So that's kind of how you would fix it. You'd have to bump one of the clips to the right or to the left a little bit as you start working down the timeline. There's really no other way around it other than maybe if you use the elastic tool. But again, since it's kind of synced up in the beginning, and it drifts the farther along you go, I think it's easier just to make a cut, shift it a frame or two, whatever you need. And then just go on about your video editing. The next question we have here was on a video about waveform zooming. So we can zoom in on the actual waveforms without changing the level of it, right? Most of the time when you look at your waveforms and you make it bigger and smaller using that gain line or your volume, you're actually changing the volume. But you can change the zoom level of the waveform if you're really trying to get in there being nitpicky and look for something specific. So the comment was, is this doable in the edit page? Because you can do it in the Fairlight page. But unfortunately, you cannot do it in the edit page. You can only do it in Fairlight. So if you get in there and you try it in the edit page, you're just going to zoom your tracks, you know, up and down a little bit, vertically, vertically, you're going to zoom your tracks, you're not actually going to zoom the waveform itself. So can't do it in the edit page. If you want to zoom your waveform, jump on over into Fairlight and you can do it right there. The next comment here is on a video that I get a lot of comments on a lot of people watch this. And the video was DaVinci Resolve, if I can speak here, DaVinci Resolve won't save. And here's the fix. Sometimes when you're in a project, you go to save and it says, you know, it can't save, it just it just doesn't do it, right? Or you try to close out a resolve. And it says, Oh, hey, by the way, do you want to save this before you close out? You're like, Yeah, and you hit hit save. And it doesn't save. So the way around it that I found that works for me every time is to just enable dynamic project switching in your project manager, open two projects at once, and then I can save it and close it. And it seems to work out fine. So 16 Mays here says, Dude, thank you, I lost so much progress on a job, and didn't edit for a week because of this bug. I managed to do all of the edits. And then this happened. Oh, it happened again. But you saved me. Thank you. Well, I'm glad that that video helped out. And, you know, there's been different fixes for different people. There's definitely comments on that video that other people have had, you know, things that work for them to fix it. For me, it's always that dynamic project switching, change projects. And then, you know, it always works and I'm able to save. So I don't know what's with that bug. It's been around a long time. Maybe it's just me. I don't know. But based on that video and the people who watch it, I don't think it's just me. So I don't know what's going on with that. But Blackmagic, maybe check that out. I don't know. I don't know what's what's what's up with that, right? What's up with that? Moving on to the next question on a video about why DaVinci Resolve voiceover is not working or it's not recording. You can't get, you know, your microphone enabled or it's just not working. You can't record into Resolve. So we have a viewer here that says, I click record, but it doesn't work. Please help me. So there's a couple things that you want to check. If you're watching the video of the podcast here, I'm going to go through it right now and resolve. But if you're just listening, I'm going to explain it the best that I can. So jumping into Resolve here, we, if you're going to record into DaVinci Resolve, I'm just going to make a new timeline here. We're going to call this voiceover VO. I'm going to hit create. So I'm going to jump over into the Fairlight tab, the musical notes at the bottom. And now when we're in Resolve here, the first thing we need to do is tell Resolve, Oh, hey, by the way, I want you to record this device into the program. So sometimes, if you had your microphone already hooked up, it's going to see it by default, right? Resolve is going to see the microphone. But if it doesn't, what you want to do is come to DaVinci Resolve at the top left, come on down to preferences. That's going to go ahead and open up your preferences under system along the top. We then want to go to video and audio I slash Oh, and under the audio in and out, I slash Oh section, you've got your input device. So right now on mine, I have it as the EVO for which is the audio interface that I'm using to record this podcast right now. Got the microphone goes into the EVO for. So that's set up fine. But if you don't see your microphone selected right here, you want to click that drop down and go ahead and select the microphone that you want to use to record directly into DaVinci Resolve. And make sure you got that set because if that ain't set, nothing else is going to work for you. So definitely check that first. And then go ahead and hit save. And then we're going to want to get into Fairlight. Now you need to have a timeline created and you know, have your video or your audio track there, you don't need a video track, you could just do an audio track if you're only recording audio. So the next thing that you want to do to record your voiceover is come on up to the Fairlight menu. And we want to come down to patch input and output. Now in your patch input and output on the left hand side, we have source. And on there, we're going to want to click that drop down and make sure we have audio inputs selected under the destination side, which is on the right, we want to make sure we have track input. Once you have those two set, you can then select your microphone. You should see it on the left hand side. Here I have four different EVO fours because my audio interface can do four different inputs, right? I've got two XLRs and two 3.5, not 3.5. What are those? I don't know what size those are. Quarter inch? It's quarter inch for like a guitar or whatever. I don't know what size that is, but whatever size that is. So I've got different inputs there. So you would want to select it on the left. So select your microphone on the left, and then select your tracks that you want to record to on the right hand side. Then once you do that, you're going to go ahead and hit patch at the bottom. I'm not going to do it right now because I don't want to mess up my recording here. But that's how you would do it. And then once your microphone is patched and to resolve, you then want to come to your audio track and you would hit the R right here, arm it to record. Now it's not going to arm right now for me because I didn't actually patch my microphone. So I don't mess up the podcast here. But you're going to want to hit that arm to record. And then you're going to want to hit the record button that's up in the toolbar. And that should tell resolve, hey, start recording. And it's going to go ahead and record your voiceover. Now the tricky thing once it's recording is if you don't specify where it's going to go, by default, I think it goes to your cache file locations. So where your voiceover is going to go, just show you real quick. If I come to my project settings, a little gear icon at the bottom right, going to bring up our project settings window. And if I go to capture and playback, and come down to capture, right here, it says save clips to now this by default, I believe is like where your cache files are as well. But you want to hit browse, and then you want to go find wherever you want to save your voice voiceover. So I usually if I'm recording a voiceover, I'll save it with that project. But you want to make sure you tell it where to go. Otherwise, there's a good chance you're going to lose it. You're like, I can't find my voiceover. But it's there. It's probably with your cache files in that directory somewhere. So you want to do that, make sure you tell resolve where to save your recording and a little bonus tip here. When you're doing a voiceover, if I were to name my track something like whatever J's VO, when I record my track, that recorded file, the recorded file is going to be named J's VO. So whatever you name your track, that's what your recording file will be named. So that's kind of handy. And that's a relatively new feature that they added for doing voiceover work and stuff here in 18.6, maybe 18.5. I don't know, one of the more current versions there. It just got added in. So that's kind of the quick version of how you record a voiceover. And if you're having problems, it won't record. You're probably missing one of those steps along the way, or maybe something's not patched right, or there's something going on there. So those are the things I would check. If everything looks good, you should be off to the races recording there. All right, next question here is on a video titled Real World Audio Editing in DaVinci Resolve, where I took out a viewer's audio because he was having some issues with it, couldn't figure out how to work it and get it to sound the way he wanted to. I edited it and made a video about it, put that out. And I'm actually going to be doing some more of those, working with your guys' audios, because it's kind of fun, you know, real world stuff, instead of me just making up something for you. I'm going to show you guys how to edit the audio on your own clips, just so you might know how to tackle some audio issues when they come up for you. But Kristen Smith, it says, thanks again, Jay, for helping us new audio noobs deal with this stuff. I found your channel quite helpful. And wonder if I could make a request. I've been using the audio ducking feature. Thanks for the bid on that. Audio ducking is awesome. But I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get the audio to ease up to full volume after the spoken stuff is done. It just hits right back to normal volume in one go. And it's pretty jarring. Do I have to resort to using keyframes and manually ease off the or ease the audio back up to full? I've been playing around with different things in the dynamics window. I like to hold an attack. But the problem still eludes me. Probably the answer stared me right in the face. Thanks for your advice and keep up the good work. So yes, in order to have the music kind of gradually come back in, when you're working with the auto ducking feature, you need to deal with the release button in your dynamics. So let's just jump into resolve here. I'm going to bring up my time the timeline here for the logo transition video I just put out recently. We're going to jump in there. And let's see if we can show you guys how this works here. So I'm just going to make a copy of this timeline. So logo transition v2, we're going to copy that just so I don't mess anything up here. All right, we're going to open that guy up and get to the copy. Oh, it's already open. So let's just take all of my little keyframes off of this music clip right here. We're going to set it back to its regular volume. So let's just come up to inspector, reset the volume. So as you're going to hear right now, it's going to be really loud. So hopefully it's not too loud. Today, I'm going to show you how you can make an awesome logo wipe transition. We want to create a logo wipe transition between. Okay, so too loud. Let's get into turning on our auto ducking. So I'm going to come over to the fair light tab music notes at the bottom. Always jumping in the fair light. Now we need to use our dynamics panel to do this. So the audio for my dialogue is in track number two. So I need to come to my audio track number two. I'm going to turn on my compressor. Actually, I don't even need to turn on the compressor. I'm going to hit the send button that's under the compressor. You don't even have to turn the compressor on because I did actually use a separate compressor for this video. Always trying out different plugins and stuff just because why not because audio is fun. So make sure you turn on the send button here in the compressor of your dialogue track. Then I'm going to come to my music track, open my dynamics, and under the compressor again, this I am going to turn on the compressor and I'm going to hit the listen button to allow the compressor on my music channel to listen to my dialogue so it knows how to react. So in order to get the auto ducking to work, I need to lower my threshold because that's going to say when does the auto ducking start. So I'm going to drop that back. Let's just try it at 33 for now. The ratio, I'm going to end up dropping this down a little bit more, but let's play through and just kind of get this set. And then I'll show you how our attack hold and release work because the release is the one that we're going to want to take a look at for that music to ease back to our normal volume. So let's just play through this and make some quick adjustments here. In DaVinci Resolve here, I'm in the edit tab and we want to create a logo wipe transition between this clip and this clip right here. I want to go from talking head into the tutorial. So it's a whole lot easier than you think. All you have to do is come on up to your effects library. We want to go to our video trend. Okay, now as you can hear, it was very jerky, very jarring, and that's not what we want for our auto ducking, right? But we've got our stuff set in a decent spot, I think, for our threshold and our ratio. Sounds like it's going to be quiet enough. So the attack I wanted to be the default, that's pretty much fine. The hold is once that auto ducking kicks in, and then it no longer receives a signal from my dialogue track, how long should it hold that auto ducking on before it starts to release and go back to normal. So in this case, I'd like to do, you know, it depends on on the clips and stuff, but maybe somewhere around half a second. So 500 milliseconds, let's try that. Let's just see how that sounds here. It's a whole lot easier than you think. All you have to do is come on up to your effects library. We want to Alright, so we want to even longer than that, I'm going to bring it up to a second because we heard it bouncing back up too quick. So now let's try that we're going to change it to a 1000 milliseconds, which is one second. Go to our video transitions, scroll down until you see logo wipe transition. We're going to click on that drag. Okay, so we're going to leave that at 1000, but notice it still kind of shoots back up real quick, right? So this is where the release comes in. And this is where we answer our viewers question here. We want to bring this release up to just have it gradually, you know, fade back into its normal volume. So right now by default, it was at 93 milliseconds, which is like, boom, it's right back, right? Really quick. So I'm going to bring this up. I don't know, maybe even do like a second. I don't know. You just got to play with it and see what works good for you. But if I pick 1000, let's just see how that sounds with with our clips here. We want to go to our video transitions, scroll down until you see logo wipe transition. We're going to click on that dragon. And that's a little bit better. Let me find a spot in my dialogue here where I kind of take a little bit of a break. We're going to zoom in on my timeline here, or where at least I leave a little more space in between what I'm saying. I could even, you know, make a little spot here or something. But let's just try right here. Click on your transition and go ahead and open up the inspector in the inspector here. We want to turn off the text wipe because I don't want. All right, let's just make a little section here. I'm going to select these couple of clips and I'm just going to make their volume zero. So that way once the, you know, we get to it, it should bring the music back up. I'm going to come to custom logo. Okay. So could you hear that right there? The music ease back into its normal volume. So that was a little slow. Let's bring it back to half a second and try it again. I'm going to come to custom logo. So go. All right. So even that went up a little quicker. Maybe it does want to be around a second or so, you know, you decide what you like and what you think sounds good. But you would want to adjust the hold so it tells it how long to keep the ducking active when there's no signal. So if I drop this back, that's 429. There we go. You know, less than half a second. And then it should take a second to go back to its normal volume. So let's last time here, just play through this. You can hear what that sounds like. Custom logo. So go find your logo that you've got in your media pool. Now it did kick in pretty quick. And that's because our attack is very fast. So if I slow down my attack, I don't know, let's try 15, 14, 15, let's try that and see how it sounds. Last one promise this time. So go find your logo that you've got in your media. So that's a little more gradual there. So hopefully you get the idea there. The attack, the hold and the release are going to be what's smoothen out that transition for you when that auto ducking kicks in and then releases. So a little bit of a long answer there. But I hope that was helpful for you guys to just hear that and see that if you were watching the podcast here. So hopefully that answers the question for that one. Next question we have is on Waveform Zoom. The question was, what's the quickest way to zoom into the timeline horizontally? So just jumping back into the edit tab here in resolve. If you're watching the quickest way to zoom horizontally is to hold the shift key and use your middle mouse wheel. And that is going to zoom everything vertically, vertically, but then he said horizontally. He said horizontally. So I'm going to use the option key now or the alt key on a PC, same middle mouse wheel and zoom like that. And I know some of you guys don't have a middle mouse wheel. I don't know why you wouldn't. You better go pick one up because it comes in super handy here in resolve. So the middle mouse wheel, I mean, I use it all the time for all kinds of stuff. But yeah, so option or alt middle mouse wheel is going to zoom horizontally shift and middle mouse wheel is going to zoom vertically. And then if you were to hold control or command on a Mac and your middle mouse wheel, that's going to pan back and forth around the timeline. So really quick and easy to get around the timeline without having to use the little sliders and things up in the toolbar. So that's, that's how you do it. All right, got a comment here on our real world audio editing video from a channel called pro ASMR says, by the way, can you please check the channel channel called low ASMR? I'm looking for his audio quality. He's got the best ASMR audio editing skills. Can you break down how he does that? So ASMR videos are a huge thing out there. I've stumbled on some and watched some and while I don't quite totally get it, it is in the realm of audio stuff. And I think I'm going to make some videos about it on how to edit your ASMR audio videos. Just because I think there's some principles when it comes to audio editing that you can use to edit your ASMR videos. And I know that's like a huge niche and a lot of people make those videos as well as watch those videos. So I think I might just try and make one myself, edit the audio and just share with that community of people how you can use some of the audio tools in DaVinci Resolve. And if you don't have Resolve, whatever program you might be working in, the concepts and the things that I would do to get the sounds that those videos are looking for, like that crispy, crunchy sound, whatever, they're going to be universal. So whatever audio program you've got that you're using to edit with, it's going to be the same concept. So I do have on my books to make some videos about editing ASMR audio because I think it's kind of cool. It'd be a fun challenge for me and that community is huge and maybe they can benefit from a little bit of my audio knowledge. So if you're into that stuff, stay tuned and eventually I'll have a video out about it. All right, so the next question we got on the VoiceOver Problems video again. Another comment says, thank you very much for your video. I have a problem. I don't see the wave signal even. I even followed your guidelines. Please help. Okay, so one of the reasons why you may not see your meters moving, let's just jump back to Fairlight here, musical notes at the bottom. So when you are set up to record a voiceover, the input monitoring settings are going to determine whether you see the meters moving or not when you're trying to record. So if you come up to the Fairlight menu at the top and then come down to input monitoring style, you've got different options here and once your track is armed to record, you should see your meters moving. But if you don't, one of the reasons could be these settings right here, input monitoring style. So you can hear it only on input. Auto is typically what I'm going to recommend and use. You can hear it only when recording. You can mute it or you can repro. I forget off the top of my head what that means. I'd have to look it up. But generally, I'm going to use auto here and you should see your meters moving when you arm your track to record. And make sure you got on some headphones because if you just have your speakers open, it's going to feed back, start squealing and doing all kinds of crazy stuff. So that's the first thing that I would check. Obviously, check all the other stuff. Make sure you're patched in and good to go. Your microphones, you know, set as the input and all that that we already talked about. But then check your input monitoring style and make sure that you have an option selected there where you can actually hear or see the meters moving in here, what you're recording. Next question on a video called mind blowing text feature in DaVinci Resolve 18. The question is, is there a spell check feature in DaVinci Resolve? Because I'm the worst speller and I hate having to always go in and out to spell check. Unfortunately, no, there's not yet. I keep waiting for that too because I can't spell for beans. As a matter of fact, I put out a video the other day where I spelt the word resolve wrong, not the first time. And I'm sure it won't be the last time. But yeah, no, there's no spell check in there yet. I hope that comes because I can't spell for beans, man. I just, I have never been a good speller. And sometimes I'll spell it wrong. And I don't even notice it looking at it. I'm like, is that right? I guess that's right. I don't know. And it's been a lot of times where people have left a comment, yo, you spelt this wrong, brah. Like you're, you're tied to your thumbnails wrong or you spelt this wrong in your video. You're right. I stink at spelling. I mean, hey, is what it is, right? So hopefully they add that in. But currently, nope, there is no spell check in DaVinci Resolve. To resolve 18 for beginners guide 2023, everything you need to know, I got to make another crash course coming up soon too, coming up to a new year here. But he says, once my videos have been saved to my computer after rendering, do I clear the render status? Now, what they're talking about is in the deliver page, after you've gone ahead and rendered out a job, you have on your render queue on the right hand side, it'll say, you know, job completed in, you know, 10 minutes and 34 seconds or whatever. And there's a little green writing up there that says when it was completed and how long. And if you right click on your render queue there, just taking a look and resolve for those following along, you've got clear render status, you can go ahead and clear that out. It's fine. It's not going to do anything. It's just telling you that it was already rendered and how long it took. You don't have to clear it every time you render. It's really just some information there to help you out. You don't have to worry about it. You want to clear it? Go ahead and clear it. If you don't want to clear it, hey, that's cool too, man, you don't got to worry about it. The next comment here is actually not a question, but it's a little negative comment here because we do get these every once in a while, you know what? And I mean, I just don't get it because I don't think I've ever left a negative comment on somebody's video. I mean, if it's not what I'm looking for, I just move on, you know? I take some effort to write in the comment, but I want a sound library video, right? How to create your sound library in DaVinci Resolve plus how to get the free sound library from Blackmagic. We had this guy, he said, you could have explained it clearly in a minute, but chose to muddy the waters by yapping for nothing about 16 minutes for ad money. Disliked. Beep you. Okay. Hey buddy, look, listen, you can always fast forward. Okay? You could do that. And you know, some people like the in-depth info on how to do different things. Now, maybe you just wanted to know that one little thing and that's cool. You could have just found that part and moved on. But you know, hey, I try to do the best I can for everybody out there. You know, I don't take any of these comments, you know, too harshly. People make man nasty comments, not all the time, thankfully. Most people are actually really nice. But hey, you get the grumpy person every once in a while and what are you going to do? You don't like it? Just click on another video or fast forward. I mean, come on, nobody's making you watch, right? But anyway, on to the next question. All right. The question is what external hard drive do you recommend? My passport hard drive will not appear on Disk Utility and I need a replacement. So I like the Samsung T5 or T7 SSD hard drives. That's what I use. I've got a Mac mini, but I don't keep any of my files on it. I actually keep my video files for active projects on my Samsung T7. Things awesome. You can find them on sale sometimes. I have the two terabyte version. If I got another one, I'd probably get the four terabyte one because more space is better, right? But yeah, it's Samsung T7 SSD is great. The T5 is great too. I use both of them. And then once I actually am done with my project, I offload the video files that I have for, you know, finished projects, essentially, and I move them over to a RAID system that I have. I have a other world computing. It's a Thunder Bay, eight-bay Thunder Bay. I'm only using four bays on it. I got like 36 or 48 terabytes in there between a couple drives. So I use that as my long-term storage and that works out great. And that's a direct attached storage, not like a NAS drive or NAS drive. And the reason I do that is because when I back up the backblaze, any directly attached storage to your computer gets backed up, you know, unlimited data or whatever. Like, I can't have an external hard drive or a NAS drive back up to the cloud for a reasonable price. But if you have a direct attached storage device, you can back up as much as you want. So I think I have like, I don't know, 20-some terabytes up there at backblaze. So that's why I have a direct attached. But the other world computing thing works great. So those are my two storage options that I currently use. Another comment on the waveform zooming. I don't understand why BlackmagicSci was okay to allow you to only do this in Fairlight and why you can't do it in the edit page or the cut page, to cut the video. Yeah, I don't know why you can't zoom the waveforms in the edit page. I don't know. Maybe that's something to add in. I mean, it's just as easy to jump into Fairlight to do it. You can show your video clips in Fairlight too if you wanted to see the video clips or just view zoom in vertically on the timeline there for your audio files. And then you can see your waveforms a little bit better. I mean, I think that's just fine. But hey, maybe that's a feature that I'll add in. I don't know. All right, next question here is a good one. And it says, also another random question, if you happen to see this, is there a keyboard shortcut for go to next or previous keyframe? So if you're working with a video clip, you put a couple keyframes in there to move it around, animate it, whatever, can you jump from keyframe to keyframe while you're trying to work on the clip? And yes, you can. So you can do it in the inspector by going to, for example, the zoom section, you got the little diamond on the right hand side. And if you've added keyframes, there's a little carrot arrow or what do they call that? A carrot? You know, this way and that way? I don't know. Where you can go keyframe to keyframe. But if you're on your timeline, you want your playhead to just jump there, you can use the bracket keys actually to jump from keyframe to keyframe. So works out really quick and easy. I think I made a quick tip Tuesday about that. Jump it from keyframe to keyframe using brackets. I think, I think I did. If I did, I'll try and link it above here. If you're watching the video, if not, just search, you know, keyframe to keyframe, Jason Jodlowski, quick tip Tuesday, maybe? I don't know. I can't remember. Make a lot of vids, man. It's hard to remember stuff sometimes. But yeah, keyframe to keyframe, use your bracket keys. Next question is about deleting your render cache, right? Because render cache is going to pile up quickly here in resolve. You could end up with like gigs and gigs and gigs and gigs of space being, you know, taken up by cache files and stuff and render render cache files in resolve here. So the question is maybe a dumb question. It's never a dumb question. Okay, never a dumb question. We all start somewhere. If you have the question, there's somebody else that definitely has the question. So just ask him. All right. So what happens if after deleting the files in the cache directory, I need to open an open again, an old project, it just takes time to render it again question. Or does it give me problems in the timeline because deleting the cache? So no, it doesn't give you any problems. What happens is if you're using something like, you know, smart render or let me look in resolve here, if go to playback render cache and use something like smart or user where it'll like pre render things for you in the background, if you delete all those and then go back to an old project, open it up. Resolve is just going to take some time to recreate that if you still have your your DaVinci Resolve set to create the the smart cache or the user render cache. So it'll just recreate it, you know, it may take some time to build it back up. But I think, you know, having it take a little bit of time to rebuild the the cache files if it needs it is better than having that stuff clog up your computer, you know, because your computer will fill up quick with all those cache files. But at the same time, you can also just turn that render cache to none and not and tell resolve, hey, don't create any render cache, and then just go ahead work on your project, and then you'll be good to go. So depends on your settings. But yeah, it's not going to cause any problems to delete your render cache. Next question is on the video jump keyframes to keyframes, which I wasn't sure that I made a few minutes ago. But it looks like I did make it because here's a comment on it. They said, awesome, what about chapters more like this please so for markers, I'm thinking he's talking about markers, or is it flags maybe one or the other. But you can jump marker to marker in your timeline. If you've got markers there and to do that, you would just use shift and your arrow keys and that should jump it marker to marker. If that doesn't work, you may need to check your keyboard shortcuts. I do use the default DaVinci resolve keyboard shortcut setup. I've modified it a little bit, but whatever the standard stuff is in there, most of it I haven't changed. I just changed some of it. But yeah, so shift and the arrow keys should jump you from marker to marker. All right, the next question that we have here is on a video called make your audio sound professional using Fairlight in DaVinci Resolve. The question is, if I'm making a movie and some scenes sound more dramatic than others, is it common to put that dialogue scene on another track and add a compressor for just that scene? So when it comes to your dialogue, whether you're making a movie, a basic YouTube video, or anything really, use as many tracks as you need. If you have different scenes, different microphones, different actors, I would separate all that stuff out into different tracks because each specific type of audio filmed in a specific type of location for a specific person is going to need some different treatment, right? Whether that's just a little bit of EQ, maybe some different compression or dynamics, you're going to want to separate that stuff out and that's going to allow you to get the best audio for that particular you know, set of audio that you got. How else do I explain this? I guess really breaking everything out is probably the best way to do it. Now, while you should break everything out because you know, each actor and microphone and everything in location may need its own EQ and stuff like that, there's no problem to use multiple audio tracks. You'll probably have more audio tracks, way more, than you would video tracks, but you can apply you know, the specific things for that track or whatever, or that you know, microphone or actor or whatever, you know, onto a particular track, but then if you need to apply something like reverb or something like that to multiple tracks, you can always use a bus and do that just once, right? I do have a video about using buses and how you can send tracks to a bus, so then you only have to adjust things once if it needs to be applied to all of the tracks. So it just depends on how you want to do it, but yeah, set it up with as many you know, audio tracks as you need, different sets of audio and everything is going to need different treatments. So yeah, use as many tracks as you need to, that's fairly common. I don't see any reason why you wouldn't separate everything out and really just make it sound the best that you can. So yeah, do it as many tracks as you need, do it because I think you can have like a gazillion tracks here in Fairlight, probably about a gazillion. And the last comment here I want to mention is a super thanks for 15 bucks from Dave Chadwick, 7609 on our video about how to save when DaVinci Resolve doesn't want to save. It says, you know, your tip regarding won't save was invaluable. Here's a tip for me, many thanks. Thank you so much for the super thanks and for supporting my channel here. I really appreciate all you guys out there watching, man. It's just, it's a blessing and just so cool to be able to do this for a job, make videos for you guys, help people, help a lot of people really, and then just be able to just get in this creative world, you know, and do creative things and get jazzed up about it and make podcasts here and, you know, edit videos and do all this fun stuff. You know, it's a blessing to me to be able to do this stuff for you guys. And just a huge thank you to you, Dave Chadwick for your super thanks. Really appreciate your support in the channel and as well as everybody else who's picked up anything from my store or even just watched a video, you don't have to buy something or anything like that just by watching the video. It's helping out, you know, my channel helping support me and support the channel and just really appreciate you guys just, just giving the support that you do, you know. Yeah, I mean, I'm just, I'm just super thankful for, for all you guys out there and for the opportunity to do this. So that is all the questions I have in this episode of the DaVinci Resolve podcast guys. I'm going to try and do this some more because like I said, it's fun. I enjoy it. It helps you out and people come across questions and it's easier to just talk about it sometimes than it is to, you know, respond in a comment sometimes. So I will do my best to pick out some good questions for you guys. We're going to keep this thing going as long as you guys keep commenting and leaving notes on my channel. And thank you guys so much for tuning in with that said DaVinci Resolve podcast episode number eight in the books here. Thanks so much guys and I will see you in the next video or the next podcast. See ya. Bye bye.
