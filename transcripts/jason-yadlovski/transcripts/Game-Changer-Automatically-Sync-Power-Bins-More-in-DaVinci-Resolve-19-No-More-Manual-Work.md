This is huge. I mean, I've been wanting this for a little while. I didn't even know it was in there. So I'm sitting here this morning, drinking a little coffee, answering some of your comments, and then I realize that power bins will automatically sync up to your hard drive. What? That's insane. How did I miss that? I must have missed that somewhere. You gotta check this out. Let's jump in Resolve. Individually Resolve here, power bins. We love them, right? So I'm gonna open my media pool. I've got my power bins right here. And if you don't know what a power bin is or anything, power bin is a way that you can have access to certain assets, whatever you put in a power bin in every single project. So they're coming super handy and I use a lot of them for my music, my sound effects, for overlays, you can see all the different categories here I kind of created to put stuff in. But check this out. Here's how I set up my power bins, right? On my hard drive, I've got folders where I have all the things that I want to put in a power bin. So for example, maybe it's an audio folder where I'm always adding in new files. Or for example, here I've got this video clips folder, right? I want to make a new power bin, I'm just going to drag my folder, drop it in my power bins. And now I have video clips right here. And it's got the two files in there that I'll be able to access in any project, right? Well, what happens when I add more files into my folder over here? So I'm just going to take both of these guys, we're going to duplicate them, just so there's something else in there, it duplicates. So now I've got four files in there. So now instead of having to drag these into my power bin to add them in there, which is what I've been doing for my music forever. That's kind of annoying and kind of a pain, right? Well, in Resolve here, the new addition that I knew about was if I right clicked and I said, Resync media files, then it would bring in those new files. So if I just hit that, you can see now I've got all my files there. Cool, that's great. And I was thinking, you know, it'd be really great if Blackmagic Design made DaVinci Resolve do that automatically, right? That'd make a lot of sense. Well, silly me, I'm going to right click right below that says automatically Resync media files. Duh, how did I not see that? How did I miss that? So I'm going to turn that on for this folder here, video clips. I'm going to jump back in here and let's just duplicate all these. So there's more in there. And now when I jump back in Resolve, boom, they all automatically just come right back in. And not only can you do it in power bins, we can do it in regular bins as well. Check this out, under Master here, right? In my Master bin, even if I had additional bins and folders in here, I could just right click, Resync media files if you want to do it once. If you want it to do it automatically, maybe you keep filming more footage and you're adding in new clips to your folder structure on your hard drive. Automatically, Resync media files there. Game changer, game changer. Bro, are you kidding me? I was like, man, that's awesome. I'm trying to answer a comment from somebody and I saw that and I was like, wait a second, I know I said somewhere recently, I was like, this would be really cool if Resolve just resinked it up automatically, right? Kind of like a dynamic link, right? Between the folder on your hard drive and the power bin in DaVinci Resolve. Because if you're like me, I add music all the time. I've got tons and tons of music and sound effects and I just drop it in a folder and then I bring it to the power bin, you know, so that way it's always updated. But if I can just have Resolve automatically do that, huge time saver for me and my workflow and something that I stand corrected because I'm pretty sure recently I said you couldn't do that, but you actually can do that. And there's so many little things like that here in Resolve that are just like hidden little gems, right? I didn't hear anybody talk about or say anything about that. I'm sure somebody did, but I probably didn't see their video. So anyway, there you go. Speed up that workflow. Power pins resink automatically. Pretty awesome here in DaVinci Resolve 19. Does this program just keep getting better and better or what? I mean, Blackmagic, you guys rock because you just keep adding in all of the awesome stuff that we ask for. So and sometimes I don't even know it's there. I don't even know it's there. But I guess that's part of the fun of it, right? We poke around Resolve, you figure out new stuff and new ways to do things and use these new tools here that they provide for us. So I hope you guys have an awesome weekend. I don't think I'm putting out any more videos this week, but I had to get this one out because I was like, I think I just talked about it. So anyway, you guys have an awesome, awesome weekend and rest of your week there. And thank you guys for tuning in. Appreciate all of you. And I will see you in the next video. Hey.
