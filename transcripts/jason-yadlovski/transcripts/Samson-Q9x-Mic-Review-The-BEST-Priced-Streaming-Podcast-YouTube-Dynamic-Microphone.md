Guys, we are here today talking about the Q9X microphone from Samsung. This thing is great. Let's just talk about it a little bit. It is a dynamic microphone has a cardioid pickup pattern in front of the microphone. Right now I'm about maybe six inches, eight inches away from the microphone and I've had a chance to try this thing out and I've got to say I'm impressed. So this microphone comes in at about $129. You can get it from Amazon, B&H, most major retailers and Samsung did send this out for me to try out. They're not paying me for this review. But I'm just going to give you my opinion and thoughts on it and I got to be honest, like right up front, this thing sounds good, man. If you're into podcasting, you need a microphone that's going to do a great job picking up your dialogue, your voice. This microphone is an awesome deal for $129. I've had a chance to try out a bunch of Samsung products and I got to tell you their microphones, I mean, they're top notch. They do a really great job. So this is an XLR microphone. You can see on the back here, we have an XLR cable plugged into it and you're going to have to plug it into an audio interface to get it into your computer. So I'm using an Evo 4 audio interface. That's what I always use for all of my other XLR microphones. So while this is an XLR microphone, you do not need phantom power to run this microphone. And if you're not familiar with phantom power is some microphones need power, whether it's an internal battery that you got to put in or coming right from your audio interface, you can run power from your audio interface into the microphone. You do not need that with this microphone. It'll work by just plugging it directly into your audio interface using an XLR cable. So that's a good thing to know. Keep in mind, one less thing you got to worry about. You do not need phantom power for this microphone. Now, when you're using an XLR microphone, generally, you're going to get a better quality recording than you are if you're using a USB microphone. Not to say that the USBs aren't great, they are. But with an XLR microphone, you're just going to get a better quality sound and you can get better microphones to use in an XLR setup. So looking at this microphone, it's got a really tight pickup pattern right in front of the microphone. It's going to help eliminate some of that ambient noise. And just to kind of illustrate here how it doesn't pick up noise from around and behind the microphone. I'm going to bring up a little YouTube here. I have a fan app on here. So let me play this. Should be able to hear that. Now, if I bring it around this way in front of the microphone, how much is getting picked up? Bring it to the side over here. Can you still hear me? Alright, and bring it over to the other side over here. You can kind of see how well or not well it's picking up that background noise. And then if I bring it back in front here, we got this fan going. So you should have been able to hear there how it isolates, you know, just picking me up and not picking up stuff all around the microphone. Now, another thing that I found really cool about this microphone is that it does a great job of eliminating or not allowing plosives. And plosives are those hard P's and B's when you're speaking into the microphone. For example, Peter Piper picked a packet of pickled peppers, right? Did we hear the plosives in there? Now, in my tests, I didn't really hear too many plosives. It's not to say you're not going to get any because we're talking directly into the microphone. There's definitely a chance you're going to get some. But I found that this microphone does a really good job of helping prevent those plosives from ever happening. So that is huge because you don't want to deal with that in your podcasts or your recordings or whatever it might be. One little test I like to do with microphones here is just a little distance test, right? So right now I'm about 6 inches or so away from the microphone. Now, if I back up a little bit, maybe there's about a foot and I know it's aimed up a little bit. So if I come back here, you know, that's maybe 2 feet, 3 feet. I'm probably about 5 or 6 feet now away from the microphone. How does it pick me up? Now, we did see it did a great job with eliminating some of that background noise that might happen around the microphone and really does a good job of just picking me up. But that's a little distance test in case you're, you know, a little distance away from the microphone. How does it sound? Well, that's what it sounds like there for you. Now, one other test that I like to do is a proximity test because that generally as you get closer to a microphone, your voice is going to sound warmer and have a little more body to it. It's going to sound a little fuller versus when you're away from the microphone a little bit. Again, about 6 inches away here, I thought it sounded pretty good in the test that I did. It sounded like it had some body to it. It had some thickness to the voice. Now, if I back up even a little bit more, does it start to get kind of thin sounding? Do we lose that proximity effect there? I don't know. What do you guys think? Drop a comment down below. Now, when it comes to mounting this microphone, you are going to have to mount it up somehow to a boom arm that I got here or maybe, you know, you got a boom arm. You can mount to your desk. It does have a larger thread size right here on the little stand that it's got there. It does not come with its own stand, so you're going to have to have something to mount this microphone to. But the mounting bracket that's on here, it's very sturdy. It's strong and, you know, the actual build quality of the microphone itself feels really good. Like, it's got some weight to it. You can tell it's got a good solid build quality to it. And I've noticed that with other Samsung mics, too, they've got top notch products. It feels good in the hands. It's got some weight to it. It's got a, I think it's got a metal body on here. It feels like it's metal anyway. But really good build quality. And I think it just does a fantastic job of picking up my voice. Now, everything that you've heard in this video so far is just raw, straight from the microphone. I've not edited or processed this audio at all. I've just made sure I've had some good levels, which I set before I started recording. I am recording directly into DaVinci Resolve. So if you use DaVinci Resolve, this is just recording through my audio interface right into Resolve. And it just sounds great. It does a really good job. And I have to say, I am super impressed with this microphone from Samsung. Another cool feature that it has on the back of the microphone here, it's got the ability to apply a little bit of processing directly in the microphone to help enhance the voice. So give me a second. Let's turn this guy on. So I just went ahead and turned on that boost on the back of the microphone there. So you should be hearing a little bit of a difference here in my voice. Maybe a little bit, a little bit clearer, a little bit more presence. I believe that this boost the midrange of the vocal a little bit, which is kind of where your voice lives in that one to two K range, a little bit more. I'm going to have to take a look at it maybe on a spectrometer or something like that to kind of see are we boosting it, I would say maybe in that three to six, six, five, six K range a little bit to increase a little bit of clarity. I don't know, I'm going to have to go back and listen to this and hear how it sounds. But this is what it sounds like if I turn it on. I'm going to go ahead and turn it off now and we'll see the difference again. All right, so there it's turned off and that's the difference there of what it sounds like. So you have the option to use that it will enhance it as you're recording. Now that's baked into the recording so you're not going to be able to change it after the fact, just something to keep in mind. Overall, I think this microphone is a home run for Samsung. I mean, 129 bucks for a microphone is a great price for an XLR microphone, a dynamic microphone. The sound of this thing, it just sounds rich. It sounds full. I think it really does a great job. It could be perfect for recording in your studio kind of like I'm doing here. Maybe you're doing YouTube tutorials. Maybe you've got a podcast, right? This would be an awesome microphone for a podcast. This microphone, I'm impressed with it. I think Samsung did a great job with it. If you guys are looking for a microphone, you're looking to spend in that, you know, 100 to $150 range for 130 bucks. This microphone is a great buy. I think it does a great job. It sounds good. You don't even have to do any processing to it if you don't want to. It just sounds good right out of the box going into your audio interface directly into your computer. It does a great job. And I think if you don't have a microphone or if you've got a cheaper lower end microphone and you're looking to go from, say, a USB setup to maybe an XLR setup, this microphone is definitely worth taking a look at. A huge thank you to Samsung for sending this one out. Jonah, thanks so much, man. This microphone is awesome. I love it. I think it does a fantastic job. You guys are doing an awesome job over there with all your products. Really appreciate everything that you guys are doing. Keep cranking out high quality products like this. And anybody that's out there looking for a microphone, I would recommend this one. It's awesome. And thank you so much, Samsung, for letting me give this guy a try. With that said, guys, thank you so much. And I look forward to seeing you in the next video. Peace. .
