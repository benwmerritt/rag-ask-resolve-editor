The Venture Resolve 18.5 is awesome here guys. There are so many awesome updates that I keep finding here as I'm going through the program and checking out all the new stuff. I'll be sharing a lot of it with you here on the channel. But today we're talking about a new AI tool that is gonna help us take our sound effects, our music dialogue, our audio and classify it into what type of audio is it. And then it's gonna further put it into Smart Bin so that way we can say, hey, I want an animal sound, I want an insect. Boom, we can go to that Smart Bin, grab that sound and we don't have to hunt through tons of files to find it. It's a really cool and easy feature to use here in the Venture Resolve 18.5. It is only available in the studio version though, so keep that in mind. If you don't have studio, you're not gonna be able to use this tool in the free version. But it just gives you another reason to upgrade to studio, honestly. If you're not on studio yet, you gotta jump on there. But if you're like me and you do have tons of sound effects and music and you just have it in a big pile in a big folder, right? Cause that's what I do. Everything's in one spot. We're gonna use this new tool to sort everything out. Today's video is sponsored by MotionArray and I did grab all of these sound effects and music files from MotionArray. If you haven't checked them out, go sign up for a free account. You can get a lot of cool freebies on there from music to audio to sound effects to overlays, templates, text. There is a ton of great stuff on there. Photos, stock video, motion graphics, tons of awesome stuff on MotionArray. I've been using them for a long time and I used the free version for a long time too, the free account. So if you want some free assets, jump on MotionArray, sign up for a free account. Link is in the description below. If you want to sign up and have full access to everything, you save a few dollars by doing that. But a big thank you to MotionArray for providing all these assets that I'm gonna show you how DaVinci Resolve can sort it all out for us. So let's just jump into Resolve and I'll show you how it works. Jumping into DaVinci Resolve here, we wanna be in the media tab right here. So jump into the media tab. Now there's a few ways that you can work with the AI here to have it automatically categorize and sort your clips. One way is to grab all of your sound effects and bring it into your media pool. So you can see right here is my media pool and I currently don't have anything in my project. So I can go through, grab all of my sound effects and drop them into the media pool and then do it that way. But the way I'm actually gonna do it is to use my power bins that I have already set up. So for example, I have a power bin here that has sound effects in it. And inside there is all of my MotionArray sound effects. And I put it in a power bin just so I can access it quickly and easily in every single project. So here are all of the sound effects I have from MotionArray. Now in order to have Resolve use the AI to classify these and sort them for us, what you wanna do is select the clips that you want to have Resolve analyze. So I'm just gonna click hold and drag a window over a couple of these guys here. And maybe we'll do three rows worth. And once they're selected, you can right click on any one of them, come down to audio classification and you can analyze. So I'm gonna go ahead and hit analyze. Resolve is gonna bring up this analyze window. It's gonna do its thing. And then I'll show you how it classifies them and puts them into smart bins for us. It doesn't take long for Resolve to do this. A lapse time here is like a couple of 10 seconds maybe that it just went through 33 clips. So now for example, if I select one clip and I come over here in our metadata section, just turn off these audio here and we scroll down in the metadata section, we'll get to a part that tells us right here category. Now you can change this, sometimes Resolve will get it wrong, I'm sure. But most of the time it's pretty good. Click effect, we have uncategorized, dialogue, effect, music and silence. So this was classified as an effect. So the category is automatically set for you right here in the metadata. So if you want to further break down what the effects are into the different categories, you actually have to bring your effects into your project. So let's bring in those effects that we just classified, right? I'm gonna again, select the first three rows here and I'm just gonna drag and drop them into my master bin that's part of this specific project. Drag, drop it in. So once I have the sound effects classified and actually bring them into a project, Resolve will attempt to further break them down into a little bit more specific categories in the SmartBins so that we kind of know what they are. Now in this example here, I found that, it was able to sort a couple of the sound effects but not a ton of them. And I imagine as we move forward and maybe when the full release comes out, the AI is gonna get better and better at recognizing what our different sound effects and audio are. So that way you can just do a better job of specifically sorting them into different categories. But if we look down in our SmartBins here, you can see we have video clips, audio clips, dialogue, music, effects and uncategorized. So if I click on the effects, it did get the major categories, right? The effects, right? Into its own SmartBin here, which worked out good as well as the music, it did a good job with that. Now when it gets to the subcategories of further breaking it down, if I click on the top subcategories here, you can see only about five of them was it able to put into separate bins. And I think it's just because of the type of sound effects I was using. If you have something that's more obvious, you know, an animal or, you know, people or things like that, the AI is gonna have an easier job of sorting them out for you. But I think in time, it's probably gonna get so good that it can probably do everything. And we'll get there, I'm sure. But for now, you can see it sorted a few of them. And if you just click through the different categories, you can see the sound effects that have put in there for you. But I really like how I can just have everything mashed in one folder. And at least it's gonna sort it by the music, the effects and the dialogue for me. That's huge off the bat. And being able to break it down into the smaller categories in time as it gets better and better is gonna be an awesome feature here too that I'm really excited and looking forward to. It's just gonna save me some time when I'm looking for specific effects. The AI tools here in DaVinci Resolve are awesome guys from voice isolation to subtitles to transcription to now sorting out our audio effects and being able to classify them for us. AI is just making the job a whole lot easier for us and helping take care of some of those things that let's be honest, we wanna focus on the creative, right? We wanna make awesome videos. I might not wanna spend the time sorting out my effects into different categories, right? So Resolve can do that for us now. Blackmagic Design, thank you guys for throwing that in there. What a cool feature here. Super excited about all of the other awesome updates here in 18.5. There's gonna be more videos about that stuff coming up here as we move forward. And with that said guys, thank you so much for watching. I will see you in the next video. Peace.
