What's going on guys welcome back to another video here on the channel today I've got a video that I think is gonna be pretty helpful for you And it fixes a problem that I had in trying to use all kinds of assets in my videos I've got all kinds of cool assets things from cool arrows like these guys over here or those guys over there I've got cool full-screen effects like this. I've got overlays. I've got music I have a ton of assets that I want to be able to access in all of my projects today's video is sponsored by MotionArray and I do get most of my graphics my overlays little things You'll see in my videos arrows and text templates all that kind of stuff I get it from motion array because they've got great stuff and we'll talk about them a little more later But what I really want to talk about is how do we? Organize our assets and then how do we make sure we can get to them from every project because you don't want to keep Multiple copies of all these assets. It's just gonna clog up your hard drives You're gonna have to hunt through your files and try and find them and it's just a pain I've been there. I've been there. I've tried it and it's a pain in the butt. Let's be honest So what do we do? How do we fix that the way we fix that is by using power bins? So it's a combination of managing our files in some kind of organizational structure, right? And are in our finder or explorer if you're in Windows and then how do we get that into the power bins and organize it there? So that we can access all of our assets in every single project and not have to worry about bringing them in bringing this in Where did I put that? I don't know where things are. I can't remember. It's on a hard drive Somewhere nah, we're not gonna do that. So let's jump on the computer here. I'm gonna show you my setup I think this is gonna really help you guys out It's really helped streamline things for me and just make it easier to get all of these awesome assets for motion Right when I want to drop them in a project. So let's check this out. So before we even jump into DaVinci resolve Let's take a look at my finder How do I structure and set up all these assets that I got because over time they add up and I just I've got a ton of them So what I like to do is on my external hard drive on my SSD I keep one folder and then inside there. I'll organize all of my assets So I have media for all projects now inside there I have an audio folder for all of my music sound effects sound effects from motion array I have a brand assets folder where I use logos from Adobe or black magic design or the DaVinci resolve logo To buddy tick tock all that kind of stuff. I also have a folder for motion array assets So everything I get from motion array is gonna go inside this folder and then once it's inside there I kind of break it down and organize it a little bit. So you can see here I've got announcements graphics intros overlays sound effects I've got video clips in here YouTube promotion and I just kind of like figure out How do I want to organize all these things and I break even some of them down a little bit for it farther? So how you organize it is really up to you But I feel like you want to start with a good structure Somewhere where your computer is always going to be able to access these assets because once we bring it in resolve You don't ever want to have to move these assets You just want to be able to leave them where they're at and they're just gonna appear in every project So I use a Samsung t5 SSD and that's where all these assets live and thankfully so far I've had enough space on there I haven't run out of space yet, but this is where all those assets are gonna live now jumping into DaVinci resolve Right here. I've got my power bins open if you don't have your power bins You can't see them make sure you've got your media pool open and if you still can't see them or they're just not showing up for you You want to come on over to view and come all the way down to show? Power bins and that way you're gonna make sure that you got the power bins open now You can adjust the windows here a little bit just hover over you'll get that little symbol You can drag it up and down a little bit, but now you can see in here I have different folders within my power bins right I've got some transitions on divider title packs I have a whole folder with just transition sound effects end screen folders I've got my music folder where all my music lives now again You can mimic your folder structure from Finder or from Explorer if you want that works out great And I like to separate it by music I get from you know art list versus motion array just so I can kind of keep track of Thing so you can see I have a motion array folder right here I've got sound effects that I get from art list as well So I get sound effects from motion array They have great stuff and then down here a lot of my other folders here such as the Subscribe and like folder that I have here all these come from motion array and one of my favorite parts of motion array are all of the Awesome graphics motion graphics and overlays that they have they have so much stuff there I love to jump in here and jump on their website I can take a look at some of the arrows and the different call-out kind of things that they have that works out really great for me I also like some of the things like like the fire right here You know you want throw a little fire on your screen here like this Whoo, it's getting hot you can do that if you want and if you are wondering what kind of assets you can get for motion array Check out their website You can get DaVinci resolve templates presets motion graphics plugins all kinds of awesome stuff and sometimes even when you're trying to make your Thumbnails here on YouTube you need a good photo. Maybe you don't have a photo You can just jump on to motion array here and they have a ton of great photos that you can use for thumbnails It's there's just so much here that I've been digging for months And I still haven't seen probably half of what they got here There is just awesome assets here that really just help take your videos to the next level They help make your thumbnails better the templates are easy to use they're fantastic So real quick just in case you guys are wondering what does it cost for motion array?

They're awesome Thanks so much motion ray for sponsoring today's video. Let's get back into organizing our power bins So once you have your power bins all organized It's as easy as just opening it up in any project and you can just drag and drop any one of your assets into your project Now the thing that I love about using the power bins is that these assets are always there every project I open Boom power bins are there assets are there and if you just upgraded to DaVinci resolve 18 Everything you've gotten 17 if you got your power bins full like I did all that's gonna be migrated right into 18 for you You don't have to redo anything super quick and super easy now one other awesome thing So you don't have to grab your files from you know finder or Explorer bring them in one at a time If you've got your file structure set up in Explorer or finder you can grab that whole structure and just bring it right into the power bins and that exact structure is Gonna fall right into the power bins check this out. Let's say I wanted to take my YouTube promotion Folder here and put it in the power bins all I have to do is click on it from finder drag it over drop it in my power bins Boom there it is YouTube promotion all my folders are in there everything works out great It just drops right into place for you So organizing your assets like this is a huge time saver when you're trying to throw together videos Especially if you're youtuber you got to crank out those videos right we want to share all our excitement in our videos We want to share that with our audience So having everything in a power bin all your assets so that you can just grab them real quick drop them in a project Really helps speed up your workflow And that's one of the the super important things here about having all these assets is being able to use them quickly and Efficiently right because we don't want to spend a ton of time searching for stuff. You want to be building that video You want to be able to flip through a bunch of your cool assets see what you got and be like hey I could take this and maybe throw myself an explosion kind of like I just did in this intro right here like this Wait wait wait a second hold on hold on let me try it again. I'm on my shoes here. All right ready Dude that was sweet So I hope this was helpful and just showing you guys how I kind of manage all these assets because it can get overwhelming It can get frustrating I get it I've been there and this is kind of the best system that I found to kind of work around Everything and be able to have all my assets when I want them so you learned a little bit something in this video Give me a thumbs up subscribe to the channel if you haven't already check out motion array They are awesome.
