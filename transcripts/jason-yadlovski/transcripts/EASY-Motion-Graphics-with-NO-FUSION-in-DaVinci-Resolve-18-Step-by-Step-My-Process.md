## Transcript
Oh, today I'm letting you guys in on some little secrets. I'm gonna teach you how to make easy animations and cool-looking graphics in your videos. Now, but seriously, it is a lot easier than you might think to create cool graphics that look kind of something like this. Alright, I know, I know. When it comes to fusion, it can be a little... So recently I used that in one of my videos and I had some people ask, hey, how'd you make that? That's pretty cool. So I'm gonna show you how to do it. It's a whole lot easier than you might think. And the easiest way to start making cool graphics like that is to grab some assets from some place like MotionArray, the sponsor today's video, where we can use things that are already created because we don't have to spend the time to recreate all these things ourselves, to learn how to make crazy fusion animations and stuff. You don't need to do that. Use assets that are already there. They're gonna help speed up your workflow and really just help you make awesome stuff in your videos. I mean, I use them all the time and that's what we're gonna be doing. So let's jump over into the video resolve, grab our assets, and I'm gonna show you how we can create that cool animation. It's quick, it's easy. You guys are gonna like it. Let's go. So jumping right into resolve here, one of the first things you need to think about when you're trying to come up with some cool graphic effect type of things is, you need the idea. So that's when you guys figure out what do you want to do? How do I come up with my ideas? Sometimes something will just spark my interest. I'll see something somewhere and I'll be like, hey, that's kind of cool. Maybe I can make something similar. Or a lot of times what I'll do is I'll just jump on the motion-oriented website and look through a lot of their overlays and the things that they have there. So that way I can just kind of get some ideas flowing in my head. Like I might see an asset and be like, oh, that's kind of cool. I think I could do, you know, something with it. Like maybe, I don't know, whatever. And that's kind of how I came up with the idea to do this. So let's take a look at the pieces we need in order to make this cool little effect. Now, it's not a whole lot of things that we need. So if we take a look in our media pool here, we've got a couple of different things going on. The main things are the video parts, right? So right here, I've got a VFX energy line. So if you take a look at it and I play through it, this is what it looks like. Just kind of like that little energy line. I found a bunch of these on motion array. They looked really cool. And if we just search over there real quick, we can go to search and say VFX. And once you search that, it brings up a bunch of different things for you. But what I use most of the time is overlays or stock motion graphics. So if I'm just going to click on there, you can see like we've got all kinds of different cool little things that you can put on your videos from whatever this is, wall cracking to little neon effects, all kinds of stuff. And that's kind of where I start with my ideas on how to get, you know, a cool effect or something. I just looked through here and I'm like, hey, that looks kind of cool. How can I use it? So if I scroll down a little bit, you see some of these guys right here are a little similar to the things that I got. There is a VFX energy pack right here, which is also similar. And it's just kind of like these cool graphical explosion things and moving lines. It's cool. It's cool. So that's the first thing that we got. The next thing I knew I wanted to do was throw in the DaVinci Resolve logo in there somehow. So I have a PNG of the DaVinci Resolve logo. We got that. We're good to go. And this is where I started with with my video. I'm going to put these in my timeline and we're going to figure out how can we start to make them look the way we want. So what I'm going to do is grab that VFX and drop it in my timeline. And if I play through it, okay, not too bad. It just kind of cruises in there. And one of the things I'm thinking is I want to make it a little bit faster. And I kind of want it to come in on an angle. So pretty easy to do that. I'm just going to select my clip. I'm going to come into my inspector right here and I'm just going to adjust the rotation, right? We can rotate it however we want. I'm going to say maybe like 45. What does that look like if I do 45? A little too much. Let's go back. I think that 30 degrees was pretty good. So now as I play through the video, you can see it flies across the screen, but it's still not quite covering the whole screen. So in order to get to cover the screen, I'm just going to zoom it up a little bit. So let's say there I can see most of the width there. I'm going to zoom this guy up. And to make it even easier, we can come over here and turn on this guy, which allows us just to adjust it on the screen. So let's say I wanted to fly up out of the corner and, you know, I want the resolve logo to explode right up here. So we can do that. We can also just adjust the the angle of it if we need to a little bit kind of like that. Alright, so if we play through here's what that looks like. And now it's taken up a whole lot more of the screen. I think it's looking pretty good, right? I like that. That's cool. So I'm going to stick with that. Next, I want to bring in my DaVinci Resolve logo. Just going to drag that down and drop it onto the screen. And right now it's just a static logo, right? So we need to animate that. And what I wanted to do is start off small. And I wanted to fly in with the the VFX here, the little energy line that we have coming in. So to do that, I'm going to start at the beginning of my clip. Scale this guy down. Let's say, I don't know, that looks pretty good. Going to bring him down over here just kind of off screen. And I'm going to add a keyframe. So up here in my inspector, under the transform section here, I'm going to just hit a keyframe so it adds a keyframe for all of the options that we have here, just in case I want to change other things. So now I'm going to have to move forward in my timeline. And as this shoots across, I want it to come right to there. And we can see this is where that energy burst starts to expand out, right? So right there. So that's where I want the logo to go. And I want it to get there about this time in the timeline. So now I'm just going to take my DaVinci Resolve logo and drop it right there. And now as our energy line here explodes up, I want it to I want the DaVinci Resolve logo to increase size with it. So starting right here, I'm going to just come up here, click the keyframes again. And it looks like that I not get the Oh, I'm on the wrong wrong clip there. So we want to make sure we're on the right clip. Make sure you got your DaVinci Resolve logo selected there. So once it gets up here, I'm going to add another keyframe for the size. And then I'm going to move ahead. And let's say maybe once it gets to about there, I'm just going to scale it up like this. Right? It's getting a little bit bigger. So maybe I want to scale a little bit more. And now as I'm doing this keyframes are automatically getting added over here because I had the keyframe for all the transform nodes selected. So as it goes up, and then it starts the VFX in the background starts to disappear there. So I'm just going to drag this guy in, drag the clip for our DaVinci Resolve logo and drag that in because I want it to end somewhere around there. Maybe I want to fade it out. Let's see how that looks. So let's just play through and see what we got. Alright, not too bad. Not too bad. So maybe we want it to go a little bit faster, right? The Resolve logo looks like it's lagging behind a little bit. So a couple things I could do. I could just bump this forward a little bit, or actually backwards a little bit. Shrink up the clip. How's that look? Alright, now it's a little too far ahead. So you see, you just kind of adjust it to make it look the way you want it to look. If you have to redo keyframes, you might have to redo some keyframes just to get the speed and get everything right the way that you want it. One other thing that's going to help blend it in a little bit because now it looks like that logo is just sitting on top of our little energy burst there is to change the blend mode, right? Of our DaVinci Resolve logo. So I'm going to select the logo, come on down to composite mode, and you could try different options, see what looks good. Maybe, let's see, multiply. How's that look? It's a little dark overlay. You could do that. Really, you're just going to pick whatever you think looks good and what you like. So what do I like here? I'm going to go with, let's try linear dodge and see how that looks. Play through the clip again. So there it kind of looks like it's inside the energy burst a little bit more, which is kind of cool. Now it does still look like it's off a little bit here, so maybe what I do is, right here, I'm going to turn back on this guy right here so I can adjust my clip. So as I go back frame by frame, I'm going to want to move this back a little bit more. Should add in the keyframes automatically for me. And that way our logo looks a little bit better as our energy burst comes on the screen. So let's see how that looks. Here we go. Boom. Okay. Alright, not bad, not bad, right? We kind of like how that's coming together. So now that we've got this look right, and then the next thing I want to do is start to add in some sound effects. In the video that I originally created this in, I actually also had me at the end of it. So this kind of shot across me. So if we take a look at our original here, you can see when it shoots in. So we got a bunch of things going on here. We've got sound effects. We've got a little bit of music starting. And then we have actually some motion blur on the DaVinci Resolve logo. So let's grab this clip of me. We're going to bring this over and we're going to start to layer this stuff up so that it kind of makes like a cool effect and make some interest in our video. So I'm going to bring the clip of me over and to figure out where I want to put it, I'm just going to go frame by frame here. See what we got. So maybe we'll move this over a little bit more. And here's what we got. Alright, I know when to cut. Yeah, so that's kind of good, right? I like that. I kind of like how that's coming together. Now what if I wanted this to go a little bit faster, right? We could speed up our clips if we want. You can slow it down. For example, if you really wanted this thing to shoot across the screen a whole lot faster, we could just select our clip, Command or Control R, grab the little double arrows there and just speed this up, right? So it goes quicker. So now you can see it shoots across a whole lot quicker. It really just depends on how you want to make this effect. So I'm going to undo that and just leave it as it was for now. But you get the idea of how we can start to modify some of these elements in order to make a cool effect. Now another little bonus tip here for you, depending on the overlays that you're using, if the background is black, like it is in this clip, now this one's like a, it's got a transparent background. So that's why we can see through it and everything. But if it didn't, we might need to change the blend mode of our energy burst clip or whatever clip you might be using. So to do that, you'd want to select your clip, come on to composite in the inspector, you can change this to different modes. So that way that effect or whatever it is you're putting on top of maybe another video is going to be see through, right? Maybe use a multiply, maybe use a light or a dark in blend mode. You got to figure out what's going to work best for the particular asset that you have. But that's kind of how you would handle that. Now the one that I got here, it has a transparent background, so I don't have to worry about doing that. But a lot of times I do need to change the blend mode of a particular object so that way everything will blend together nicely and it lays on top of, say, in a video of me, lays on top of there nice. So now that we've got this, we want to start adding in some sound effects because while it looks cool, it doesn't sound like anything, right? So the other assets that we had gotten or that I had gotten and that you can look for too is sound effects that just kind of make the effect or the image, whatever it is you're working on, just kind of bring it to life a little bit more, right? Now, keep in mind the sound effects could be whatever you want. I mean, they could be a whole host of different kinds of sounds. So for me, here's the first one that I picked. I picked a tire skid because I knew when I was doing this with my hands here in the video, I was like, hey, that looks like full stop. Let's stop this tire skid here. Come to a rest, right? So I got a tire skid sound from MotionArray. Here's what it sounds like. Pretty good, right? So I want to use that when I'm going like this with my hands, right? Because I want to be like, whoa, whoa, stop, right? So I'm just going to click this guy. We're going to drag him down into the timeline. And I'm just going to kind of line it up here when my hands start moving, which is right about there. Trink her in a little bit. And a lot of times I like to blend these effects in or fade them in, I should say, a little bit. That should be good. I'm going to drag in the outside because I don't need it that long. I'll fade it out a little bit more. And here's what that looks like and what it sounds like. I know, I know. When it comes to fusion, it could be not too bad. It's a start. So the next thing that I wanted was some kind of impact or some kind of hit. So when that energy burst comes across the screen and goes, right, we need, we need a sound for that. Like it's going to make a noise, right? So the next thing that I got here is some impacts, right? And here's what that sounds like. Alright, something different kind of cool. It sounds a little energy like, I guess, I don't know. So I'm just going to drag this guy down in the timeline. Make sure I have my full clip here. I'm just going to set my in points and out points for the whole thing. Drag that down. And now I want that hit to happen right when this energy burst kind of explodes there at the end. So I'm going to say like right, maybe right there. Let's try that. So I'm just going to line this up here and see what happens. And of course we're going to adjust the levels of all these things too to make sure our levels aren't too high by looking at our meters and all that kind of stuff. But for now we're just trying to get it all in there and make sure it looks the way we want it to. Alright, so I think we can back it up a little so if I select the clip go back like maybe two frames. Now I don't have anything before it. So it sounds like as this energy burst is coming across the screen here, I should hear something, right? So what I'm going to do is actually take the same effect here, the same sound effect. I'm going to copy it. I'm actually just going to copy it down because that'll be easier. We'll copy it down. And I'm going to drag in the end a little bit here. And what I want to do is actually reverse the sound effect. So instead of hearing it, you know, go the way that it currently is, I want it to go backwards because I think that might sound kind of cool. So I'm just going to right click on my clip. I'm going to go to change clip speed and I'm going to say reverse speed. And that's going to play our sound effect backwards. So let's just see what that sounds like. If I shrink it down a little bit here, drop her down and let's just solo that track and here's what that sounds like just to hear it. Alright, not too bad. So kind of cool. I'm going to just shrink it down a little bit more. We're going to fade it in. And ideally I want it to fit, you know, from the beginning of my clip right here. So I'm just going to cut this back. And let's just see how it sounds if we kind of do this and stick it right here. In the beginning of the clip, here's what it sounds like. And I'm going to un-solo it so we hear everything else as well. Kind of cool, right? Not so bad. Hear it again. Alright, and now we're starting to get the makings of a cool effect that has some cool sound effects built into it that looks kind of cool. And it's just something a little different that can add a little jazz up your video a little bit. Jazz it up because then it's going to help your viewers be interested. They're going to be like, oh, that was kind of cool. At least that's what I think when I see stuff like that. Like, hey, that's kind of cool. I like that. So we're doing pretty good here. Now the next thing that I would add in is a little bit of music. So here's the song that I had in the video that we saw. This is what it sounds like. Got it from Motion Array, of course. Alright, so there you go. There's a cool little, you know, little riff there that we got going on. So I'm just going to drag this guy down into the timeline. Going to use on its own layer. And where do I want this to start? Well, I'm going to just kind of scroll through my video here a little bit and right where it... I start before I start to talk, maybe like right there. I don't know. Let's try that. So I'm going to zoom in. I'm going to line up my clip right here where the music starts with my playhead. It's pretty good. Now I'm going to have to adjust the volume of this and stuff, but let's see how it's coming together. See how it looks first. Okay, here we go. Alright, not bad. Maybe I want that music to start a little bit earlier though. So we just kind of... You look at it and for me, a lot of it is just by feel. Like, does it feel like it sits in the right spot? Does it feel good? Do I like it? It's very subjective. I mean, you might think what I'm doing here stinks, but you know, it's all very subjective. So you do what you think sounds cool, looks good and all that. So I'm going to back this guy up a little here and right after the explosion, we're going to have that music kick in. So here is what that sounded like. So maybe actually right at the explosion is where I want the music to start. So I'm going to slide the music back a little. Let's see how that sounds. So now with our sound effects here and everything, we kind of want to start to look at our audio levels, right? We've got the components in there and they're sounding good. And again, all these assets came from MotionArray for sound effects. You just search the sound effects. They have so much stuff there. You just go grab whatever you need and it's all going to be there for you. It's like a one-stop shop for your graphics or your sound effects, your music, whatever you need. You can pick it up there at MotionArray. Oh, by the way, save some money if you use the link in the description below. So let's take a look at some of our audio levels. First, let's just take a look at my dialogue. I want to set that in a good spot. Looking at our meters here. I want to be around that minus 10 dB. So what do we got? I know. I know. When it comes to fusion, it could be a little scary. That looks like it's right around that minus 10 dB, which is exactly where I want it to be, which I said already before I brought it in. Don't tell anybody, you know what I mean? Next, we got the car skid. So let's add the car skid on top of our dialogue because we want to make sure that we can hear the dialogue as the car skid is fading out. We want to make sure that, you know, the dialogue is crisp, really, because that's the main thing that we're concerned about here. So let's just play through that. I'm going to solo both tracks. By soloing them, it allows me to play only those two tracks. So as we add tracks, I'm just going to solo the additional tracks. So we only hear that group that we have soloed. Just kind of helps me balance things out and really work with it a little bit better. And notice I'm doing all this right in the edit tab. You don't even have to jump into Fairlight. You can if you want, but you don't always have to jump into Fairlight. So you can do a lot of this stuff right here in the edit tab as far as, you know, working with levels and audio and things like that. Fairlight is obviously going to give you more tools and stuff like that, but you can do it right here in the edit tab. Alright, skid. Here we go. I know, I know, when it comes to f- So it does sound a little loud when I start talking, so I'm going to bring it down a little bit. And I'm going to watch my meters here for my track number two over here. Play it again. Alright, I know, I know, when it comes to fusion. Alright, so it's getting up to that minus 10 dB. Now that's not necessarily bad. I might drop it back just a little more, holding my shift key and using the gain line there. Let me be a little more exact. I'm going to bring it down to minus eight. See how that sounds. Alright, I know, I know, when it comes to fusion, it could... Alright, so I think I'm going to back it up a frame. So that skid mark is really for me going like this, right? It's not really the sound of that energy burst coming across the screen. So I'm going to leave it like that. I think that's pretty good. Double check our levels here. Alright, I know, I know, when it comes... Still coming up to around 10 dB. Let me drop it down a little bit more. Alright, I'm leaving it like that for now. Now we're going to add in our sound effect for that energy burst. So I'm actually just going to bring this effect, or this sound effect back up a track, so that they're right next to each other. And let's go ahead and turn that on, see how these guys sound together. Alright, I know, I know, when it comes to fusion, it could be... Alright, so it sounds a little loud for that hit there. I'm going to bring that back just a little bit. Let's go back minus 4 dB. Now I'm going to watch the meters. I'm going to open this guy up a little bit, so we've got our audio 3. Let's see how that's looking there. Alright, I think I could drop it back probably a little bit more. Maybe I'll go back... Let's try minus 6, see what that looks like and sounds like. Alright, I know, I know, when it comes to fusion, it could be a little scary. Alright, so I feel like the skid is a little loud yet. I'm going to drop that back a little bit more there. And our sound effect for the VFX coming across, that's not too bad. Alright, I know, I know, when it comes to fusion... But what you can do here is I like the volume of that hit, that initial hit, right? But I want it to drop down a little quicker, so I can add in a couple keyframes here just to drop that volume a little quicker. So I'm just going to say like maybe right about here, I'm going to hold my Option or Alt key and click on that game line. It's going to add a keyframe for me. Then I'm going to move ahead a little bit and I'm going to do it again. Hold your Option or Alt and click. And now I can just drag down this last little part of the clip here, which is going to drop off after that hit. It's going to drop that sound down a little bit quicker for us. So let's see how that works. Alright, I know, I know, when it comes to fusion, it could be a little scary. Alright, not too bad, not too bad. I think we're getting there. And then finally we have our music. And I want it to be, let's say, full blast. So, you know, as you bring in the music files from Motion Array, they're going to be mastered and everything. They're going to be, you know, at a loud volume to begin with. So I'm going to leave it where it is. I'm not going to change the volume. And then before I start talking, I'm going to keyframe it again and just drop that music down so that way it's under my voice and it's not too loud. So let's just see at what point that starts. Go ahead and solo, add the solo and our music, or I could just actually turn them all off now since we're actually listening to all of them. So here we go. Here's what it sounds like. So I start talking right about here. So I am going to add some keyframes to this music clip. I'm going to come right about here in my playhead, Option or Alt-click. And then I'm going to go ahead just a little bit, Option or Alt-click. And now I can come in here and I'm going to hold my Shift key, grab that gain line because it allows me to be a little more precise and I can bring it down. And if you want to go farther, just let go of your Shift key and it's going to move it a whole lot more. So let's go and make it minus 16. Let's see how that sounds. Alright, so that's not bad. I might even want to keep it a little bit louder than that. Let's say let's go minus 12. And I think this is where we're going to just leave it. Let's see how it sounds. Alright, I know. I know. When it comes to Fusion... Alright, not too bad. The last thing that we did want to add in actually, which I forgot, which we saw before, is a little bit of Motion Blur on top of our DaVinci Resolve logo. It just helps sell the effect of it sailing across the screen there. So there's a lot of ways you can add some, add Motion Blur in. And the way that I think I'm going to do it is just to drop an easy effect on here. So if I come to my Effects Library, close my media pool, open the Effects Library. Come down to my Open Effects. And let's see, we have Motion Blur. Don't we have Motion Blur? Zoom Blur, Mosaic Blur, Directional Blur. That'll work. That's going to give us a directional blur of that logo flying across the screen there. So I'm just going to click it, drag it, and drop it onto our clip. See, if I just show that, the DaVinci Resolve logo, so we can see the blur happening. You can see it kind of flying through there. And once it gets right here, I don't need the blur on it as it's there. I just want the blur as it's flying through, right? So what I'm going to do is come to right before it starts to get a little bit bigger, frame by frame here. And so I'll say, say right there, I'm going to select my clip, come into my Effects, which is in your Inspector, go to the Effects. And in here, we can adjust the blur if we want, right? We can make it more blur, less blur. So I'll just leave it how it is. But what we want to do is come to our Global Blend. I'm going to open that up and I'm going to add a keyframe. So a keyframe right there. And I'm going to go ahead like two frames, and then I'm just going to drop that down. So now we don't have that effect applied anymore, right? So we're going to see it flying in with the blur. And as it zooms up, then it's not, it doesn't have a blur on it, right? It's just going to zoom up for us. So that's how that's working out. Check it out. So there you go. It's looking pretty good, right? And like I said, there's tons of ways to add blur. This was just a quick one to throw on there. You can do it however you want, but that's one way that you can do it real quick and easy. Add a little bit of blur on there. You're good to go. So now when we put it all together, it looks like it's flying in. And our final result, here we go. Alright, I know. I know. When it comes to fusion, it can... Alright, so there you go. That is how you can take some easy assets here from Motion Array, the sponsor of today's video. And just start to piece things together in order to make some really cool effects. You don't have to learn how to create the little energy burst yourself. You can create a lot of these things on your own, your own sound effects. You don't got to do that. Just you go to some place like Motion Array, you grab the assets, and it allows you to just creatively make a video without having to figure out how to do all those little detail things that make it really cool. Grab the assets. You're good to go. Pop them in. Come up with a cool idea. And there you go. You're going to have an awesome video in no time. So a huge thank you to Motion Array for sponsoring today's video. Love you guys. Like I said, I use their stuff in my videos all the time for a lot of cool effects and stuff. If you guys want to save a few bucks, check out the link in the description below. I'd highly recommend them. Even give them a try. They do have a free account. And you can just jump on there, try some free assets. I mean, you got nothing to lose there. Check them out. And with that said, guys, hope you found it helpful. Have any questions or comments as always, leave them down below. And with that said, thank you, Motion Array. And I will see you guys in the next video. Peace. Oh, by the way, do you enjoy these videos where I show you just how I create these cool little effects and stuff? Let me know because if you don't like it, it can be awesome. I'm not going to do it anymore. But if you do like it, I'm happy to show you how I do cool little things like that in my videos. So anyway, all right, guess I'm off to go edit this video. I'll see you. Peace.
