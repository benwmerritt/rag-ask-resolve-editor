J cuts and L cuts, no doubt that you've heard about them. Really quick and easy to do here in Resolve. If I wanna go from like an angle where I'm showing you the front side of my desk, do a little look of what's going on behind the scenes here, what kind of gear we got, what kind of camera we got, C100 right here. It's easy to do it in DaVinci Resolve. Make those J and L cuts really quick. We're in DaVinci Resolve here and you wanna make a J cut between these two clips really fast. Here's how you do it. In your timeline, make sure you have your pointer selected. Come to the clip you wanna slide back or start the J cut on. You're gonna hold the alt key if you're on a PC or the option key if you're on a Mac and then you can just get the little cursor that looks like this, click, hold, drag it back as much as you want. Gonna zoom in a little bit and then I'm just gonna slide these two clips together because when I select them, they'll both highlight, boom, I can just drag it back in and here's what it looks like. I think I'll wear them showing you the front side of my desk. Do a little look of what's going on behind the scenes here. So that is it. It is just that easy. Use your alt key or option key, grab either the audio or the video, doesn't matter. Scooch one of those clips back, slide them together, boom, you've got your J cut or your L cut really fast and really easy. No reason to unlink clips, just do it this way. It's way quicker. I'm telling you. All right guys, thank you so much for watching. I will see you in the next video. Peace. Here's some outtakes for you.
