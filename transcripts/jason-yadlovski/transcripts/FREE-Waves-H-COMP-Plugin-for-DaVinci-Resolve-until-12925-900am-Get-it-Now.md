For the next 48 hours, you are gonna get this plugin from Waves for free. That's right, and the plugin is the H-Comp plugin. So this is a compressor plugin, and we're gonna be taking a look at it today. I'm gonna show you what it does and just go over the knobs, buttons, and dials, show you how it works on a sample clip, and you guys can go ahead and download this for free. It's completely for free. You do need to sign up for a Waves account if you don't have one. They're gonna ask for your email and that kind of stuff. So you'll have to do that, and I'll briefly mention how you get it installed later on in this video. But first, click that link in the description below. Go pick up the plugin for free, and in this video, let's take a look at some of the knobs, buttons, and dials so that you kind of understand how it works and how you use it. And a big thank you to Waves for giving away this plugin today. Appreciate them. They've been a big supporter of my channel, and I use some of their plugins on pretty much all my videos. So let's jump in Resolve and check out this H-Comp plugin. Starting in the Edit page here, I've got a sample clip in my timeline. Just a little, you know, talking head of me in my shop area here. And this is gonna be the clip we apply the H-Comp to. Now, you can apply it here in the Edit page, but we're gonna jump into Fairlight because it's really an, you know, audio tool. I'm an audio guy, and I love me some Fairlight. So let's jump over into Fairlight, Musical Notes at the bottom. Now, in order to find this plugin here in DaVinci Resolve, once you've got it installed, which we'll talk about later in the video, what you would do is make sure you've got your mixer open. So mixer at the top right here. You want to come down to your track, and it's an effect. So we're gonna go ahead and click on the plus, and then you want to come down to Dynamics, VST. And then you're not gonna have all of these items in here. I have all the Waves plugins, but the one that you're gonna look for is this one right here, H-Comp. So go ahead and click on that, and it's gonna insert the plugin on that channel for us. So this is what the free plugin is gonna look like. This is the H-Comp Stereo. You can use this in Stereo or in Mono. And just starting right at the top of the window here. Let's run over what we've got going on as far as the different features and tools in this plugin. So we can use the side chain here in DaVinci Resolve to activate this compressor if we wanted. I'm not gonna go over exactly how to do that, but that's available for you to do. You can also automate the plugin as we can with any other audio feature here in Fairlight, if you want to use the automation tools. We have some presets that come as a part of this compressor. And if you click right here, it's gonna drop down a list of a whole bunch of different presets. You can see there's a lot in here for, you know, drums and kicks, guitars, strings, mastering, different artists that have put together different types of settings that they would like. So you can start with some of the presets here and see what you like. So this compressor can be used on either instruments, drums, vocals, dialogue. You can really use it for whatever you want. And all the presets in here are just some different options of things that you can try. If you want to get started somewhere, maybe you want to try the type vocal, you know? Maybe you try something like that. Or throw it on your master bus if you want to try using it for mastering right here. Click on the mastering preset and see how it works out. So a lot of presets in there that you've got, you could just, you know, start with and see how they work out. You can also always create your own presets and save it so it'll appear in this list here. But just good to know you've got some options on presets that you can try and see what might sound good. We can also set up A, B testing right here so we can try one settings versus another. And you can save it. If you click on this little hamburger thing here, you can change the size of it the way it looks. You can look up the user manual just in case you want to know a little bit more about how the plugin works. So first up here, the first style we have is analog. Now, if you're using this for dialogue, you might not want to use this at all. But let me just tell you exactly what this dial right here does. So there's four different settings on it. And what it does is it provides a different amount of warmth and drive characteristics to your, whatever you're applying it to, your track or your clip or whatever it might be. And what they kind of do is they just kind of give the sound a little bit of color, if you will, kind of just warm it up a little bit. And it's not based on anything specific as far as like, you know, an old school piece of equipment or hardware. It's just a general analog emulation that just adds a little bit of color to your audio. So you can try out the different ones, see what you like. But if you're doing dialogue and maybe you don't want that, you could just turn it off and use the offsetting right here. The next section right here is we have our meter. And right above our meter, we've got a few different options. We can meter our input levels right here. We can meter our gain reduction amount, which is probably what you're usually going to want to see when you're looking at the compressor and seeing how much it's reducing, you know, your audio there that you're working with, how much is a compressor in the audio. And then you've also got the Out button here, which is going to show you your output levels from the effect. So typically, you're probably going to want to use the GR setting, but you've got the options there if you want to change it. And then we have the limiter right here. If you want to turn on the limiter, it's going to automatically set that for you. You don't have anything to change. It'll just put on a limiter just to make sure you don't clip or peak. The next dial we have here is output. And this is going to control the amount of output coming out of the effect. So we've talked about this before. That's when you have an audio clip go into an effect and the effect processes it. And then that signal comes out of the effect. A lot of times you're going to lose a little bit of volume, right? A little bit of gain and you need to boost that up a little bit. So right here using the output here, we can boost it up up to 18 dB of gain. So if you need to boost those output levels, you can do it right here in the effect. Next up down here, we have the ratio and the ratio controls the amount of compression. So if we do just one to one, there's no compression and you can go all the way up to 50 to one. So that's going to, you know, do a lot of compression and then you can set it anywhere in between. So depending on the amount of compression you want, you're going to adjust this accordingly. Typically with something like dialogue, I aim generally around like maybe two to one or three to one at most. But you can play with this and kind of see the difference and hear what it does. And we'll try that an example here in a minute. The next dial here is the wet dry mix. And this is how much of the effect is going to be applied. And can we mix back in some of the original audio, right? So if I have a completely dry mix, that means the effect is not being applied at all. If I crank this all the way up to 100, a 100% wet mix means all of the effect is being applied. So do we want to mix the original dry signal with our effect signal at all or do we not? And that's what the mix controls. We can blend those two together. If we want to, if you don't want to, you can use 100% wet. If you're going to use a 0% and you're going to have a dry mix, then there's really no reason to use the compressor because it's not doing anything. Makes sense? One thing to know that the compressor here has an automatic makeup gain function. So in Fairlight, for example, we have a makeup gain slider in our dynamics panel where we can boost everything up a little bit more. Well, this effect has an automatic makeup gain, which is going to do that automatically for you to try and match the output signal to the input signal, right? So if you set your levels for your audio clip before you get started, you apply the effect, it's going to try and auto gain that and get it in the right spot for you. But you can always change it with the output if you need to. The next one down here is punch and punch is going to control the amount of transients that are able to pass through the effect, regardless of their attack time. So a higher value here is going to allow more transients through the effect that will come out the other side. They're not going to have the compression applied to it and it's going to make your sound a little more punchy, right? It's going to have a little more punch to it because that's kind of where those transients are, where the punches are, like for example, in your kick drum or something. If you bring this all the way down, all of those transients are going to be caught by the compressor. So a lot of this might be for musical instruments, maybe not so much for your dialogue, but you can try it and see how it works out. The attack here controls the amount of time in milliseconds for the compressor to kick in. The next big dial we have here is the threshold. So this is going to tell us at what level do I want the compressor to start to kick in. So you can dial this around and kind of see where it works pretty good for you. We're going to be taking a look at that as we work through our example here. The next dial here is the release and that controls the amount of time it takes for the compressor to release. Is it just going to boom, let go real quick? Is it going to gradually let go? And this is where you can make those adjustments. And off to the side of our release knob here, we've got several different options. We can do BPM, which allows the user to manually set the beats per minute to match maybe your music that you're working with. Now, this might not apply to dialogue so much, but for music, maybe you want to know the beat per minute. You want to set this release time to match that beats per minute. The host option here is going to sync up to the host application that you might be running this in. So I'm not too familiar with how that works, but if you need it and you know about it, you probably know how that one works. And the last one here, MS is just a millisecond setting. So you would just grab this and set it to however many milliseconds that you want. So let's get started trying out this compressor here and just see how it sounds. So I'm going to come into my compressor here and I want to reset everything. So I'm going to come back to full reset. And the first thing I want to do is play through my audio clip here and I'm going to grab my threshold and bring this up until we're getting some compression and just kind of see how it sounds with the default settings. So first thing I'm going to do, I'm just going to select my area here so that I can loop it just in case it gets to the end. It'll automatically loop back for us. And let's just go ahead and play and see what we've got here. So I'm down in my shop area here, kind of opposite of my studio, which is over that way a little bit, but got some projects going on down here, like putting up some pegboard. I was actually working on changing my first tire, my ATV, first ATV tire, right? I got this cool little guy right here, the XB450. I bust the bead of the tire off of the rim so then I can use the big old tire spoons to get in there and take the tire off the rim. And these tires have been on there since 2001. All right, so I dialed in the threshold here. I'm about minus 35 dB, it looks like. And I can hear the difference here. Let me just play it. I turned it on and off there. I'm not sure if you caught it, what it sounded like. But let me turn it on and off and you're going to hear just a little bit more like push, you know, from the compressor. It's kind of, it's compressing it. But as, you know, I mentioned earlier that the effect is actually doing like an auto leveling or auto gain. So it's kind of keeping the volume at a good level here. So just take a listen and see if you notice a difference. I'll start with it off, turn it on and then turn it off again. And these tires have been on there since 2001 off the ATV that I got. And it was tough. It was a lot harder than I thought and took a lot longer than I thought. But I did learn some tips along the way. So when I do the other three tires that I got to do. All right, so can you hear the difference there? It just kind of helps push everything up a little bit adds some a good amount of compression. Now one tip when you're working with some compression here, especially with like dialogue or vocals, you don't want to compress too much more than like, you know, the six right here. Right. We see six DB of compression right here on the effect because then it's going to start to sound a little too squished. Right. Now if you're working with some music and maybe that's the effect you're going for perfectly fine. It's not like a hard, fast rule. Like you can't change it. You know, you'd be creative, do whatever you want. But with dialogue, like I don't want to compress it down more than like six DB if possible. Now there's some parts where I might yell a little louder or in my clip right here. I've got a little bit more of a spike. So if I play through, let's see where that spike sounds probably going to go below minus six a little bit. And I don't know if you guys can hear my dog, but she's being all loud up there. Shh. I'm trying to make a video of the rim so then I can use the big old. So you can see it swung down between the six and 12 DB there. So no problem, not a big deal. You just don't want to consistently be way down below, you know, six DB of reduction. Now if you wanted more or less compression, you could use your ratio right here. So here's what that sounds like. If we dial that up just to get a feel for what it's doing. Spoons to get in there and take the tire off the rim and these tires have been on there since 2001 off the ATV that I got. And it was tough. It was a lot harder than I thought and took a lot longer than I thought. But so I'm going to dial that back to three. You can hear the difference there a little bit, I hope through YouTube here. I did notice I do have the analog. It's turned on at the default settings here. So let me turn that off and I don't know if I'm going to be able to actually hear a difference here with just normal dialogue. But let's give it a quick listen and see if we notice anything. That's what I'm hoping. So anyway, here's a little sample for you. We're going to be using the H comp. You got that free plug in, get it. And yeah, waves makes awesome stuff. So every once in a while I partner up with them, give away a free plug in. So stay tuned because if you want more, all right, it's really hard to tell the difference. I think I can tell like a hint of warmth, you know, getting at it in there. Is it going to make a big difference for your dialogue? Probably not. But you can try it if you'd like to, you know, kind of just color the sound a little bit. Now as far as our output levels, I'm going to watch my meters down here and resolve and see if I need to boost this up at all. So let's see what we got. So I'm down in my shop area here, kind of opposite of my studio, which is over that way a little bit. But got some projects going on down here, like putting up some pegboard. I was actually working on changing my first tire, my ATV, first ATV tire, right? I got this cool little guy right here, the XB450I bus the bead of the tire off of the rim. So that looks like it's getting close to that minus 10 dB, which is where I typically like to get my audio to sit. So I did boost up the output gain a little bit there. So that's a convenient feature to have in here. And I just be able to boost it up a little bit. Now my audio is looking pretty good as far as the levels are concerned. Now I did set the levels in the timeline first. I normalized the audio there. But after it came through the effect, we can always boost it up a little bit more if we need to using that output control right there. And just to show you what the wet dry mix is doing here, let's play through this and adjust that wet dry mix. So this is going to mix some of the original signal without any of the compression back into the audio signal with the compression and kind of like, you know, put them together a little bit. So let's listen and see what we got. So then I can use the big old tire spoons to get in there and take the tire off the rim. And these tires have been on there since 2001 off the ATV that I got. And it was tough. It was a lot harder than I thought and took a lot longer than I thought. But I did learn some tips along the way. So when I do the other three tires that I got to do, it should hopefully go a lot quicker. That's what I'm hoping. So anyway, here's a little sample for you. We're going to be using the H comp. So I can kind of hear a difference there a little bit. Again, it's very minor. A lot of these changes, especially for dialogue, right? With instruments and music and drums, stuff like that. You're going to notice probably more of a change than you will with just normal talking dialogue here. But you can dial it back a little bit. It almost sounds a little bit better. I think if I drop it back to around like 60 there. So kind of mixes a little bit of the signals back together. But that's up to you whether you want to use the full, you know, full wet mix or if you want it more on the dry side, right? Either way is just fine. It depends on what you like. Now down in here, we've got our punch and our attack again with dialogue. I'm not sure we're going to see too much of a difference here. Let me just we're just going to play through and crank up the punch and see if we notice anything. And then I'll do the same with the attack. You know, we'll lower it down and have that thing kick in real quick or we'll try making it a little bit longer. Right now, the default looks like it's at seven milliseconds. So let's just play through and see what we got opposite of my studio, which is over that way a little bit. But got some projects going on down here, like putting up some pegboard. I was actually working on changing my first tire, my ATV first ATV tire. Right. I got this cool little guy right here, the XB450. I bust the bead of the tire and these tires have been on there since 2001 off the ATV that I got. And so could you guys hear the difference there? Now the attack time is really hard to tell other than looking at the meter. You can see how quickly that's causing the compressor to kick in with the punch. I did notice it did sound a little punchier when I just went from, you know, all the way up to all the way down for dialogue. Does that matter? I don't know. That's up to you. It depends on the sound that you like for your dialogue. But it was pretty interesting to have that little bit of extra punch in there. I mean, I could I could hear it in my headphones. Maybe it's a little bit harder to hear, especially on other devices. You know, if they're not good speakers or good headphones, whatever, but it does make a little bit of a difference there. And then the release, I'm probably going to just leave this at the default settings. I think that's going to work out fine. But just for fun, let's jump up here and just try one of these other presets that are in here. Let's go with tight vocal and see what that does. And here, like putting up some pegboard. I was actually working on changing my first tire, my ATV, first ATV tire. Right. I got this cool little guy right here. The all right, not bad. And I mean, there's all kinds of stuff. Let's see what the mastering one looks like. So this you might want to apply on your master bus, right? As you're finishing up your audio work. But let's just see how it sounds on this one particular clip. XB450i buss the bead of the tire. I mean, it sounds good. You know, I think I would try that on my master bus just to see how it works out in one of my projects. Now, if you don't know how to get it installed, let me just show you really quick. It's pretty simple. It's going to appear in resolve automatically. At least it should. If it doesn't, let me just show you how you can load it up real quick. But here is how you go about installing a waves plugin. So on the waves website, once you go ahead and use the link below, you'll be able to get for free that plugin. And the way you need to install it is by doing this. You're going to need to go to the download section and come to waves central. So the way waves plugins work is you install waves central and then that is able to install all of the various plugins. It holds all your licenses for the plugins and that kind of stuff. So you would download your either Mac or Windows version. Go ahead and get that installed. And then I'll show you what that looks like. So I'm on a Mac and this is what waves central is going to look like. You're going to be logged in with the account that you created. You've got your creative access. You can install products here. I have all of the waves ultimate package here. So it's got everything. But if you only have specific ones like the free plugin that you just downloaded, that's going to appear here and you can just click on it and then come over here and click install. And it's going to go ahead and install it on your machine. If you need to see your licenses, you can set up an offline installer. And then they have the studio verse, which is just another tool that waves offers as well as things that are new. You can scroll through all the plugins right here in waves central. You can see everything that they've got. I'm pretty sure for example, if I clicked on clarity VX, yes, it jumps you back to their website so you can check it out. But anything that you have as part of your account should appear here in waves central and you should be able to go to install products and install it. Now, once you have those installed, jumping back in an adventure resolve, you should be able to open resolve and resolve at least for me always looks through my default plugins and can find them and load them up in DaVinci resolve. But if you're having some trouble, you can always come to DaVinci resolve at the top left preferences. And we want to come to the system side and audio plugins. And right here is where we want to select our locations for where these plugins got installed. So you can add in the locations right here and then resolve will always search for those locations and add any new plugins that you might put in there. Or you can see, you might be able to see down here what the available plugins are. So I've got a ton of them from waves, but you can see I check them all on. If you don't want all of them, you can turn them off totally up to you on however you want to load up your plugins. But once you do this and you add them in here, you could close resolve, open it again and it should load them all up right in the mixer for you so that you just go ahead and start using them and add them in as effects. Now pretty much any VST plugin is going to work here in resolve or VST three plugin either way. They all work just fine. And once you've loaded them up in here, you can go ahead and hit save. And you should be able to just come to Fairlight, find it in the mixer, you know, right here by adding the effect. If you opened your effects library over here and you came to VST effects, you're going to find it there as well as in the edit tab, you're going to find it in the effects library there. So it should just appear in all those places for you once you've gone ahead and installed it using wave central and then making sure that the venture resolve has loaded it up for you. So if you have any questions about that process, you get stuck, feel free to reach out to me or send waves a note and either one of us should be able to help you out and make sure you get all squared away so you can use your plugins. So that is the waves H comp compressor guys. I hope you download it. You get it for free. I love giving stuff away to you guys and a big thank you to waves for providing the plugin and allowing me to give it away to you guys. Like I said from time to time, we partner up with waves and I'm able to give away some free stuff. And so keep an eye out for that. Usually it's only like a 48 hour thing. It's not indefinite. So limited time offer here. So you want to pick that up as soon as you can. But I use waves plugins all the time. I really enjoy them. They work great in DaVinci Resolve and maybe I'll do a video where I just kind of go through my vocal effects here that I use, which are primarily waves plugins. It's three of them. And I use those on all my videos. So they work out great and hopefully this H comp is going to give you a little taste of what it's like to use the waves plugins. Enjoy that free plugin guys. And with that said, I'm out of here. I got to make some more videos for you guys and I will see you in the next video. Thanks again waves. We'll see you. Peace.
