Guys what is happening welcome to the video and I am super excited for today's video because we are talking about audio automation Audio automation can really help convey a story with just your audio And I've got an example here You're gonna see in a second our final product of how the audio really tells the story of the clip and then I'm gonna show You how we started with something that you would listen to it You'd be like well that doesn't make any sense and how we can automate our audio to make changes over time and Really convey the story of what's going on in a scene So I wanted to get into this for a long time, but I was a little confused by it and you may be too So let's just talk about what is audio automation real quick Just so you have an understanding of what it is and kind of how it works So when it comes to audio automation essentially, it's like keyframes for audio now You might be thinking well Hey, I can keyframe some audio right if we look in the inspector in DaVinci Resolve in the edit tab or even in Fairlight we can keyframe things like volume or Panning but there's not a whole lot of other things that we can keyframe right and that is where audio automation Comes in to play automation allows you to essentially keyframe It's not called keyframes, but it's like keyframes keyframe anything that has to do with your audio You can keyframe panning you can keyframe volume just like we can with regular keyframes, right? But then we can automate keyframe Automate things like the EQ we can automate effects. We can automate dynamics Pretty much any parameter that has to do with audio you can automate or make changes to over time So the whole automation thing can go really deep really quick. I'm gonna try and keep it fairly basic I'm not gonna go in depth on any of the tools too much But I want to give you guys a little taste of what you can do with automation of your audio to really help convey a Story so let me go ahead and roll the tape of our final product if you've got some good headphones Maybe you got some good cans like these guys right here put those on if you've got good speakers put those on and Listen to the audio and listen to all the different things that are happening in our audio in this clip And then we're gonna talk about how do we get there right because I certainly didn't start with what you're gonna hear in the final product here Check out this video and then we're gonna jump in resolve and I'm gonna show you how to create the entire thing using audio automation Music See you later So what'd you guys think of that could you hear everything that was happening with our audio Could you hear it coming from the right to the left the volume changing the Thumping of the bass and then the music opening up We hear the whole thing and then putting into headphones a lot of stuff happening there And I did it all using audio automation, but that's not where it started right here's where it started looking in resolve I had my video track and when I filmed the video I just had a little bit of dialogue all as we heard if I solo my audio track all as I heard was this There was no music no anything happening in the car. I created all of that right in DaVinci resolve So I just had the vocal of this dad the music's too loud turn it down My bad put in my headphones here fix that right up Okay, so that's all there was there was no music and then I added a music track in another track below that right now When I added the music track in it was just your standard music track that was already mixed and mastered and everything It was just full volume right so looking at the whole clip together Let me play for it play it for you and you can just hear what it sounds like and then we're gonna get into creating all of this Spatial kind of sound and changing the way the sound is to really help tell the story of this clip So here's what it sounded like when I got started I Okay, so that's the whole clip right it was just one normal music clip and now what we want to do is just create that Whole story right with our audio so in order to do it We are gonna jump into Fairlight musical notes at the bottom here So now that we're in Fairlight here The first thing you probably want to do is go up to workspace and reset your UI layout Now I've already done this but this will ensure that you're looking at the same screen and the same things on your screen that I'm looking at Let's talk about automation and how can we get started here using it in Fairlight? So first we need to turn on our automation tools So if we come in our toolbar right here, we have toggle automation You can turn that on and now we're gonna be able to at least enable our automation Next we have the automation controls. We're gonna want to go ahead and turn that on now I'm not gonna go in detail on all these controls here I'm gonna save that for another video But I just want to give you guys an overview of how you can get started here and how we create these awesome changes using Automation we are gonna just leave it on right for the first icon under touch We're gonna leave that on off on stop You want to change this to hold if it's on anything different there so that when we stop our changes hold where where we stop And then on enables here We're gonna want to turn on the EQ because we only want to affect the EQ settings to get started here We want to be able to create the sound that we want from the thumping bass to the full sound of the music to the tinny Metallic headphone sound we want to create that and we're gonna use the EQ to do that So this is where you just select which things will be recorded as you make changes in real time So you can select as many of these as you want But in my case here, I only want to start with the EQ the next thing we want to do is actually open up the EQ For our music track right so I'm gonna go ahead and double-click the EQ in the mixer here And again if you don't have your mixer open mixer at the top EQ you can scroll up and down at your middle mouse wheel if you need to Double-click open the EQ now the other thing you want to have open is your video because the automation changes Happened in real time over time right so you're gonna play back your video You're gonna make the changes in real time while your videos playing back those changes will be recorded and Saved so that way when you stop then go back and play through your video again You're gonna hear the changes that we make to the EQ in this case over time So it's important that we see our video looking back and resolve I'm just gonna pop out the little floating window for my video here And we're just gonna organize our our window here a little bit So now we want to start by creating that thumping bass sound How do we do that in our EQ the easiest way to do that is turn on band 6 and we're just gonna bring this back to around 350 Hertz or so so now when I play through the music if I just show you in the timeline here It's just gonna sound like thumping bass Okay, you hear a little bit of the other sound in there, but it's mostly that low-end bass kind of sound now as the car pulls up And is directly in front of camera and I open the window I want to hear the full music as it originally sounded then as I put in the headphones We want that music to go to that high-pitched metallic he kind of sound. How do we do that? Well, we're gonna watch the video back and as our Automation is recording what we're doing with the EQ I'm gonna take this point six and just drag it back as the video is playing when I start to put the window down then Once the windows down and I go to put in my headphones I'm gonna go ahead and turn on band one and I'm just gonna bring this up like this until it sounds the way I want it to sound and by cutting out the lower end frequencies It's gonna give us that high-pitched headphone kind of sound or at least what I think headphones sound like when somebody puts them in their ears So that's how we're gonna make the changes on the EQ And we're gonna do it in real time while the video is playing back and those changes are gonna be recorded So in order to turn on our automation so that it's gonna record first, I'm gonna set my playhead back to the beginning of my clip I'm gonna go ahead and click on this little icon right here, which turns on the recording So the next time I hit the spacebar and start to play through my video Any change I make on the EQ is gonna be recorded and if we look in the EQ here You can also see that it's got little red icons right below each one of the dials And that's because that is what will be recorded as I make the changes over time So I'm gonna take my band six drag it back to around 350 Hertz or so and that's where we want to start with it So I'm just gonna play through my video now I'm gonna watch the video up here and then I am going to watch for the point in time when I want to take my band six and I want that sound to Cove back to the full sound of the music as it was originally Created and I'm gonna do that as I lower the window in the van And then once it's I start to put in the headphones like I showed you I'm gonna put turn on band one And we're gonna drag that up So let's just go ahead and play it back and all the changes I make on the EQ will be recorded and then we can hear it afterwards My headphones here See you later Okay, and that's it once I stop the playback the changes are saved and now it's no longer recording and if we look at my EQ you can see now we've got green lines underneath all of our controls and that's because It's not currently recording I can play back the video and I'm not gonna accidentally change anything or overwrite anything So let's just play back the video here and make our viewer a little bit bigger here So we can see it a little bit better and we're gonna see if it's doing what we wanted to do My headphones here Okay, so we have accomplished the effect of the music that we want right it kind of sounds the way we wanted to it starts to help Tell that story of what's happening and why and if you may have noticed in the background of DaVinci resolve here The EQ automated automatically we saw it animated as the video was playing back because those changes are recorded And it's making those changes over time keyframes not called keyframes called automation But keyframing right our changes over time the next thing we want to do is think about the volume right? How do we want to change the volume of our clip so that it makes sense and helps continue to tell the story a little bit more? So I'm gonna go ahead and close my EQ because I think that sounds good. I'm happy with that So under my enable section here in my toolbar I want to change that and I want it to be fader because I'm gonna work with the volume now I don't need to work with the EQ anymore, so I'm gonna go ahead and turn that off So now what's gonna happen is when I enable the automation recording on my track I'm gonna go ahead and click that you'll notice over in the mixer now It's enabled right here and now the fader is red and the faders red because it says hey I'm ready to record as soon as you hit play. I'm recording so again We're gonna watch our video We're gonna have the music be a little bit quieter as the van is farther away Get louder when the van is in front of us and quieter as the van drives on down the driveway Let's go ahead and bring our playhead back to the beginning our button is on here to record And now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start with my fader a little lower And I actually may make it a little louder just so you can hear the bass a little bit better in the beginning But then we're gonna we're gonna change it over time and we're gonna just have it automate or change over time The volume of our clip so let's go ahead and play through it and as soon as I hit play It's gonna start recording and we're just gonna grab our fader here and make the changes that we want and make it sound The way that we want it to sound so let's do that You Later Okay, so there we go we changed the volume over time now one thing to be careful of When you're doing something like this and I notice I might have done it on accent there It's you don't want to be peaking you want to make sure when you're watching your meters right here that you're not peaking And you're not getting too loud with your audio levels there I think I may have peaked just a little bit just a little bit so be careful of that So now when we play back our video we should hear the volume change over time. Let's take a quick listen to it And you can see the fader moving over here All right, so you kind of hear what's happening here now I'm gonna redo that real quick because it was peaking and I don't want it to be peaking So I'm gonna come back to the beginning and if I wanted to do something again. I can just simply Come back to the beginning of my clip click the record button and just start over and it's gonna overwrite Whatever I already put on there now we can go and edit it, you know based on what we already did I'm gonna show you how you can see what you already did in the end of the video here once we do the panning automation But in this case, I'm just gonna re-record it It's no big deal and then and then we're gonna move on to the next phase So I'm gonna do that don't go anywhere and we'll be back in okay. I already did it So now we're gonna get into panning right? We're trying to tell the story of what's happening in the scene with all this automation with the audio moving around Changing volume sounding different right? We're building out the scene with just one basic music track So again, I'm gonna come back to the beginning of my clip here And now we want to automate the pan because the van comes in from the right Watching the video comes in from the right comes to the center and then goes off to the left So I want the audio to sound like it's coming from that way right? I want to hear from the right to the center to the left So you could use your in your inspector here you could actually keyframe So if I just select my clip here and not the tracks like the clip We could keyframe the pan right here you could do it like that But I'm gonna use automation because that's what we're focusing on here and remember you can automate anything Whether it's effects parameters in the effects Dynamics volume panning anything you can automate anything that has to do with audio I'm not gonna do it in the inspector We're gonna use our automation tools to do it under the enable section right here I'm gonna turn off fader and now I want to come to the pan section I'm gonna turn on pan and in my mixer here on my track to my music track We have the pan section right here. So I'm gonna open that up I'm gonna go ahead and enable our track to record and now in the pan tool You can see we've got all these different red lines under all of our parameters because it will get recorded as we make the changes over time When I'm watching the video I want to start with the pan all the way to the right because the van is coming from the right in the video Then as the van comes to the right in front of the camera We're gonna go center channel there and both equal right and left channels And then as the van drives away, we're gonna pan it to the left because we want to build out that story of what's happening with the audio So again, I'm just gonna hit playback here by using my spacebar I'm gonna watch the video and make the changes over time Now I could just grab this point here and drag it but just to make sure I stay, you know right at the top in the front I'm just gonna use my my slider here and just fade it like that. So let's play through the video and do that Music playing Dad the music's too loud, turn it down How bad? Put it in my headphones here, fix that right up Music playing See you later Music playing Okay, so there we go now we have the audio sounding like it's coming from one side Coming to the middle and then going out the left So all this automation just helps build the story of what's actually happening in our clip right If we just left the music flat, it doesn't sound like anything You don't know what's going on, you don't know why You can't tell the difference between the thumping bass, the window open, the headphones in So automation allows us to create this really cool effect, a really cool story with our audio here To help the viewer understand what's actually happening in our scene So back in Resolve here, it looks pretty good for the pan, I'm happy with that I'm gonna close that, we're gonna pop our viewer back in I'm just gonna go ahead and turn off my automation controls here because we're done automating all the things that we want to automate Now real quick, I want to show you how you can see the changes that we made So in order to see what we already did, the keyframes, automation We're gonna want to make sure that this is still toggled on, the toggle automation You need that still turned on And if we come over to our music track, we can click on this little drop down And this will show us a graphical representation of all the changes that we made Now you can only view one at a time, so for example with the EQ here If I come down to band 6, and what I was changing was the frequency You can see different parameters of everything you can record here in DaVinci Resolve But in this case it was frequency, so if I click on frequency, now you're gonna see what the graph looks like when I was changing the frequencies Now I think because we see this drop here, I think it's just because it can't keep going up, but in reality it would just keep going up I'm not sure why it appears this way, but we can also look at things like the pan So if we come to pan, and we did right left pan, we can see here's where my pan changed over time We can see in the beginning, then it starts to pan to the center channel and then it'll pan to the left And if we zoom in on these, I put my playhead for example right here, and I zoom in We can actually see these points, make it a little bit bigger there, and we can actually come in and change these points We can click on them, we can delete them, we can move them, we can change them You've got a lot of options on how you can modify your automation after you've already done it Maybe you don't want to record it again, so you've got options on how you can change it and work with it once you've already recorded it too You can even draw new automation in and maybe have it be a straight point, you know, from, if I zoom out, maybe from, you know, this point to that point I want it to be a straight, you know, fade up, fade line up If I use this guy right here, the focus mode, and let's say I just select this part right there I hit delete, it gets rid of all those extra little points because maybe I wasn't so smooth when I was dragging that slider back and forth And now we can see that our line is smooth, it's just point to point, boom, and done So if you wanted to get in and delete any kind of automation, this way you could come in, use your focus tool And we could just select all these things on our clip, and then just hit delete, and boom, now it's deleted all of our automation for us So let's say maybe you automate something, then you decide, eh, I don't know if I really want that You can just go in there and delete it like this if you want, instead of re-recording it and overwriting what you already did So were you one of those people that thought, hey, you can't change anything with your audio or make keyframes for things But now you can because you know about audio automation here, and it can just really help tell the story for your videos Help you do a lot of really awesome stuff with your audio I get jazzed up about this because as an audio guide, this is just something that's so cool that you can work with to really create all kinds of different stuff And I mean it opens up a whole other door for your audio and the things that you can do with it I want to know, are you guys going to try out some automation? If you do, link your video down below I want to see how you guys use it and what kind of creative things that you guys come up with when it comes to your audio automation And a quick side note, it would be a whole lot easier if you had like a black magic panel maybe And you could turn buttons and sliders and things versus using a mouse You'll get a lot smoother results and stuff and I may be trying out one of those resolve panels soon, the audio one It looks pretty cool, I think I'm going to have to give it a try But it's going to work a little bit better with something like that where you actually have physical knobs and dials and buttons to use Versus just using a mouse, so keep that in mind But you can get in there, play with it and you can still get great results and tell a story by using audio automation Guys, thank you so much for watching and I'm going to go play with some more automation stuff here, you should too And with that said guys, thanks so much for watching, I will see you in the next video If you liked it, give me a little thumbs up, would you? Maybe subscribe if you want to learn a little more about audio And just take your videos to the next level with some awesome audio Alright guys, we'll see ya Thanks for watching!
