What's happening guys? So not only is today June 13th my birthday and got my free Starbucks coffee But we're also gonna be talking about something that I love and that is audio So we're gonna be talking about how can we get more professional and better sounding audio in our videos So this is gonna be a multi-part series here and I'm gonna start out with a few tips and tricks here We're gonna jump into resolve and talk about the different things you can do to make your audio sound more professional So before we even jump into dimension resolve We need to talk about a few things that are super important when you're recording because good audio starts with your recording And if your recording stinks your audio is gonna stink. I mean we need to get the best quality audio We can when you get started making your videos. So let me put this down here real quick with down that coffee Now I want to show you guys how close I am to my camera here. So I'm gonna film a little video on my phone All right, so you should see I have it pretty close to me I'm probably only a foot away from the microphone on top of my camera So if you're using a camera and you're doing a vlog style thing like this You're gonna want to have it fairly close to you because if I move it farther away and you can hear it doesn't sound as good Right, so that's one thing that you want to keep in mind is your microphone placement Where are we putting this microphone while we're recording now if it's on top of your camera like this? Obviously I'm gonna have the camera pretty close, you know, that should work out pretty good But what if I swap to a lav mic right? I got this lav mic right here It's gonna sound a little bit different, but I want to make sure I've got some good placement, right? Maybe if I'm wearing a t-shirt, it's on my collar right here Obviously probably tuck this in but you get the idea because if I take this guy off, right? And I had it down here Well, you might not hear me as good or if it was farther away for some reason You want to make sure that you're using the right kind of mic as well as putting it in the spot that makes sense That's as close to your source as you can because obviously the closer it is to here The better the audio we're gonna pick up and the better the audio is that we're gonna have to work with once we get into the venture resolve So super important on placement with a lav mic Well, let's say maybe you've got a setup that's like this you're down in the studio Maybe you're in your office or something you're recording and we've got a boom mic, right? Or you have a mic on your desk or something. Well, look how high this guy is away from me That's too high. You don't want it to be that far away You want it essentially to be just outside the frame and that's what I try to do in all my videos Get this microphone up here as close as I can to myself so that way it's picking up just me I can keep my levels down low on the microphone for recording so I'm not picking up a lot of ambient noise Now this is a shotgun mic So that helps a lot too with not picking up a lot of ambient noise and extra noise that might be going on So microphone type that makes a big difference, but let's adjust this guy So it's about more in the right position now when I have my main angle set up this microphone is really close to my mouth I would make sure it's just outside the frame similar to how you see in this little clip right here I pull it down a little bit you see it'll poke into the frame But if it's in the spot that it should be it's just outside the frame and you can't tell that it's there So you want to make sure you've got good levels here on your camera or your recording device now You can see right down over here is my levels and it's coming up to about that green bar there And that is minus 12 DB on my Canon 5D Mark 4 here So you want to make sure that those levels are good there You're not peaking because if you're peaking you're not gonna be able to use any of that It's gonna be no good But you want to make sure that the levels are good enough and high enough that you're gonna have a good signal to work with Once you get into the venture resolve and that's just gonna make your job a lot easier in resolve trying to make this audio Sound more professional so be sure to set your levels properly before you start recording. All right So now that you made sure you're recording good audio We're gonna jump into the venture resolve and I'm gonna show you in part one of this series here on how we can make some Changes to the EQ to help sculpt our audio make it sound a little bit better make it sound clearer and Just help improve it a little bit now You may not need to apply all these things but let's jump in a resolve check it out and you can see what's gonna work best on your Clips getting resolved jumping into resolve here Let's talk about the things you can do to start to make your audio sound more professional If you have a good recording you're off to a good start because that is a Huge factor and being able to get your audio to be good because if you got garbage in you're gonna get garbage out So I'm gonna assume that your levels are pretty good because you set them up right when you start to record right on your camera As well as on your microphone, but just to double check it in resolve Let's play through this clip here and I like to keep my audio levels my vocal levels around that minus 10 dB So let's play through we're gonna take a look at the meters over here and just make sure that we're getting around this minus 10 dB range now I like to grab my headphones here. That's what I used to edit my audio It's gonna make a big difference on you know here in your audio being able to hear the changes We're gonna make and make sure that sounds good But if you have some studio monitor speakers, that's helpful too. So let's see what we got for our levels here It sounds like when you apply a high-pass filter so a high-pass filter is gonna get rid of the lower end frequencies Alright, so our sample clip here. It's looking okay. It's around that minus 10 dB range It's close enough and for this example what we're gonna be working on today I think that's gonna be just fine But if it's not you want to adjust your levels and to do that you're gonna want to raise or lower the volume as Necessary you can do that a few different ways currently. I'm in the edit tab right here You can click on this drag it up and down and change your volume there You can select your clip come up to your inspector here change your Volume in the audio tab right here boost it up same thing But you want to make sure those levels are hitting around minus 10 dB Then you should be good to go and if you guys aren't really sure on how to do that You want a little more info on it comment down below I can make another video about it I do have a video up here about setting your audio levels You can check that out too, but we can always cover it again because now we're in resolve 18 So let's get into these couple EQ tips that are gonna help make your audio sound better You can do some of these in the edit tab here if you want I recommend you jump over into fair light so we can apply it to the whole track because in the edit tab here You can only apply it to a clip so in the edit tab if I were to click on my clip Make sure you got your inspector open and you're in the audio section You can come down here and enable the equalizer here and make a few changes if you want But you're gonna have to do that on a clip-by-clip basis and for me I know I record you know on the same microphone for a length of time So I want to apply it to a track because I'm gonna put each specific microphone in its own track Just so we can adjust them accordingly and make them sound the best we can for each specific microphone So what I'm gonna do is just jump over into fair light little musical notes here at the bottom click on that Now just to make sure we're all looking at the same thing I'm gonna go to workspace and Reset UI layout and now we should all be looking at the same thing. Let's make my track a little bit bigger here Zoom in a little bit. So EQ. How do we get to it? Well, we're on audio track one here So you want to make sure that you've got your mixer open right here at the top mixer open and you should see your EQ right here If you don't see your EQ try clicking on these three little dots Make sure that EQ is checked on and then it should be there You may need to scroll up and down a little bit depending on the size of your screen So keep that in mind too double click your EQ. We're gonna open that up. All right first tip here in the EQ How do we get rid of some muddiness here in our clips to do that? You're gonna want to use a high-pass filter band one. That's where you want to add your high-pass filter So high-pass filter means everything below whatever point I set cut it out and when it comes to vocals You don't want a lot of that deep deep low-end kind of frequencies because it's just gonna make it sound muddy So you usually want to dial this up. I say anywhere from a hundred to maybe a hundred and fifty 160 depending on your particular audio clip, but if it still sounds muddy you can always bring it up a little bit higher too So let's play through and listen to how it sounds. I'm gonna start with it All the way down here at 30 and we're gonna raise it up and see if we can hear the difference So here's a sample clip where we're gonna show what it sounds like when you apply a high-pass filter So a high-pass filter is gonna get rid of the lower end frequencies in your EQ It's gonna help get rid of some of that muddiness and just make it sound a little bit better It's not gonna sound too booming. Alright, so I can hear the difference in my headphones. Can you hear that? Let's go back. I'm gonna turn it off and turn it on again Well clip where we're gonna show what it sounds like when you apply a high-pass filter So a high-pass filter is gonna get rid of the low and even if you just take it up a little further You can really hear the effects of it here. Listen or in frequencies in your EQ It's gonna help get rid of some of that muddiness and just so that's too much obviously That's why I said you want to keep this maybe a hundred and fifty at most usually I go around a hundred or a hundred and twenty Depending on the microphone and each microphone is gonna be a little different So you find what works best for your microphone But put it on a high-pass filter like this is a must when you're working with your audio vocal tracks Because you don't want it to sound muddy. You want it to sound clear and crisp So that is the first tip here in the EQ now going along with this sometimes you're gonna get extra high pitch kind of hiss noise Or or just some kind of higher pitch noise that doesn't sound good in your clip So what I recommend also in addition to throwing on the high-pass filter is a low-pass filter And that's gonna do exactly the opposite looking at the EQ here turn on band six And we're gonna just roll this guy down a little bit because we don't want these higher frequencies up here to come through Because most of the time those are just gonna be unwanted noises that we don't want to hear Let's see if we can hear a difference on our particular clips here So I'm gonna turn back on my band one. I'm gonna set that around 121 that looks pretty good now Let's turn on band six and turn it off and then see if we notice a difference here on these clips So a high-pass filter is gonna get rid of the lower end frequencies in your EQ It's gonna help get rid of some of that muddiness and just make it sound a little bit better It's not gonna sound too booming and it should do a good job of starting to clean up that audio for you Because we want to be able to hear it so you can hear a little bit of a difference there I hope you guys can hear it It's pretty subtle, but it'll knock out some of that higher end hiss or just higher end frequencies that we don't really need Now I wouldn't drop this down too low because then it's gonna start to affect the clarity of your vocal track So just to hear what that sounds like watch when I crank it down too much gonna get rid of the lower end frequencies in your EQ It's gonna help see now starts to get a little muddy again. We don't want that So depending on your particular clip you might want to set that around say 17k 16k somewhere in that range see what works out best for your clip So the next EQ tip here is gonna help again clean up that audio and just make the voice sound a little bit clearer in your videos So the human voice lives around that 1,000 to 2,000 Hertz range So we want to actually take an EQ point put it in that range and Find a part that may not sound so good because generally at least in my experience You pretty much always find something that sounds a little harsh in that area And if we reduce the frequencies a little bit in that range we can actually help improve the clarity of the audio So let's come back here, and we're just gonna work with say point four here You can use any point that you want, but I want to find where does it not sound so hot So I'm gonna crank up my cue factor here and you can actually use your middle mouse wheel to to scroll open and close But I'm gonna play through my clip and I'm just gonna come in this 1 to 2k range a little above and a little below and Find something that doesn't sound good sounds a little harsh And then we're gonna drop that frequency out and that's gonna help improve the clarity of our vocal track check it out You apply a high-pass filter so a high-pass filter is gonna get boom right there. Did you hear that? That don't sound good get rid of the lower end and let's just go up a little bit see what's going on up around 2k Frequencies in your EQ. It's gonna help get rid of some of that muddiness and just make it sound a little bit better It's not gonna sound too booming and it should do a good job of starting to clean up that audio for you So there you go. You can kind of hear that that sounds like junk So I'm gonna go ahead and just drop this guy down. Let's say maybe like 6 DB So we're gonna do a little before and after so you can really hear it here So here's before and then I'm gonna turn it on you'll hear the after so a high-pass filter is gonna get rid of the lower end Frequencies in your EQ. It's gonna help get rid of some of that muddiness and just make it sound a little bit better It's not gonna sound too booming and it should do a good job of so can you guys hear that? It helps clean up the mid-range of your vocals a lot and a lot of times It's gonna be like I said It's gonna be something in that a little below 1k to a little above 2k range somewhere in there depending on your voice Your microphone and what the clip is sounding like and before we jump into the next tip here I want to take a minute to thank our sponsor audio if you are looking for some music some royalty-free music for your videos Audio is a place that you can check out that has some great music.

You can't be to give it a try It's gonna help you level up your videos. All right, let's get back into these tips here to make your audio sound more professional So this next EQ tip is gonna help increase the clarity of your vocal tracks Now it's important that we have good audio and good clear audio because your video can look beautiful But if it sounds like garbage, let's be honest. Nobody's watching that I'm not watching a video that sounds like garbage. It has to sound good. So looking at our EQ here I'm gonna go ahead and turn on band 5 and change my type to this guy right here a little bell curve We want to do is drag your point five Somewhere around that four to six K range and you're gonna want to give it a little boost And that's gonna help improve the clarity a little bit of the vocal track. So it's listening to our sample here I'm gonna boost that point five and that four to six K range See if you can tell that it gets a little bit clearer and sounds a little bit crisper and we don't want to overdo it I'll show you what happens when we do that But some microphones and some recordings can really benefit from a little boost in this range Now you usually want to cut before you boost keep that in mind So we don't want to boost too much because then that could throw it all up But let's listen in and see what we got. There's a sample clip where we're gonna show what it sounds like when you apply a high-pass filter So a high-pass filter is gonna get rid of the lower end frequencies in your EQ It's gonna help get rid of some of that muddiness and I can hear it a little bit clearer there now if we boosted too much Here's what happened just make it sound a little bit better It's not gonna sound too booming and it should do a good job of starting to clean up that audio for you Because we want to be able so a slight boost in that four to K range is gonna help just a little bit with that clarity again You don't want to go more than maybe five DP at most you want to keep it as low as you can You don't want to make too many big changes because it could just start to sound a little little crazy And you can hear when I went too high it introduced some hiss which we don't want either So a little boost and that four to six K range can help with the clarity So those are the main EQ tips now I have one I'm gonna throw it in there because for me I find a lot of issues with my vocals in this particular range So if we go ahead and I'm just gonna activate point three here and make sure we've got our bell curve looking one right here I want to grab point three and for me for my voice. I find a lot of times there is some muddiness or some Honkiness sometimes they call it or there's different ways to describe it But I'm gonna boost this guy up and it's gonna be in that somewhere around in that 600 to 800 Rain so look in that range if you find that your clip still just doesn't sound good Some just don't sound right. Let's try this clip out See how it sounds here and see if we can find a problem area in that say 600 to 800 Hertz range Let's check this out. So here's a sample clip where we're gonna show what it sounds like when you apply a high pass filter So a high pass filter is going to get rid of the lower end frequencies in your eq It's going to help get rid of some of that muddiness and just make it sound a little bit better It's not going to sound too booming and it should do a good job of starting to clean up that audio for So maybe here around 657 let's drop that down a little bit and see how that sounds Clip where we're gonna show what it sounds like when you apply a high pass filter So a high pass filter is going to get Can you hear how that really cleaned it up? It took out just some sounds and frequencies that didn't sound good Let me turn it off and turn it on again so you can hear that real quick Clip where we're gonna show what it sounds like when you apply a high pass filter So a high pass filter is going to get rid of the lower end frequencies in your eq So what did you guys notice about that frequency range there when we pulled that out? It kind of pulled out some kind of like almost like a hollow kind of sound right and kind of for me It just kind of tightened it up a little bit So if you are having some issues something just sounds off definitely look in that say 600 to 800 range Maybe 500 to 800 somewhere in there You can pull down a little bit of the frequencies when you find that problem area And that's really going to help the vocals in your video sound more professional All right guys, so there is part one of making your audio sound better and more professional here in DaVinci Resolve As well as some camera tips because you got to get the audio good coming into your camera and recording because if you don't Garbage in equals garbage out right?
