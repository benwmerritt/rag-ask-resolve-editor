Yo, what'd you guys think of that intro? Come on, you gotta be honest, that was pretty slick, right? Come on, pretty slick. Well, today's video is sponsored by MotionArray, and we're gonna talk about them in a little bit. But I'm gonna show you in this video how you can take a template from MotionArray, and we're gonna bring it into DaVinci Resolve, we're gonna edit it, we're gonna throw in our footage, and our text, and we're gonna make an awesome intro, just like the one that you just saw. Now, I know some of you guys may not have MotionArray, and that's okay, you probably still wanna watch this video because you might get some ideas on how you can create your own awesome intro. All right, so here's the MotionArray website. Link's in the description below, you can go check that out. But this is where you can come to get all kinds of great stuff. You got templates, presets, motion graphics, plugins, all kinds of stuff. So, in order to find your DaVinci Resolve templates for the cool logo intros, you wanna come on up to templates at the top here, and then you wanna come over to DaVinci Resolve. And now you can just scroll through here, and you're gonna see all kinds of different cool stuff. But if you wanted to look for just intros, you're gonna wanna click on the intro square right over here, which is gonna filter it by just intros. So the one that I picked out is this one, Modern Glitch Promo. So, in order to download it, make sure you're logged in, and then you're just gonna go ahead and hit the download button here, and it's gonna download it in your downloads folder. Now, one thing to know is that these templates don't come with the music. The music is available on the MotionArray website, but it's not automatically included when you download those folders. So, what you need to do is when you pick your template, look at the screen here, and look down at the bottom right below the download button. It says Music, Not Included, and then it says Rock, and it's highlighted with a link. Click the link, and that's gonna bring you to the music. So, click on there, and it's gonna bring me right over to the music that's used in that intro. So that's super helpful because you want the intro to look just like you see it on here. When you play through the templates on here, you're gonna hear the music, and you can get all the music right here on MotionArray. So that's sweet. Once I get to my music one, you wanna download that as well. So, jump it into Finder here, go ahead and grab the folder out of your downloads, and put it wherever you want on your hard drive. So, for me, I got my project here, footage and modern glitch promo. You're gonna get a folder that looks like this. Inside that folder, we've got a few things going on. You've got dynamicglitchpromot.dra. That's what we're gonna bring into Resolve. Fonts, this is gonna tell you any fonts that you might need for the intro or the template to look exactly like it did on the MotionArray website. So if I click on there, you can see it tells me which one I need. So I've already got that, but if you don't have it, you can go get it, and from what I've found so far, the fonts are free. You just go ahead and go and download it. You have a help folder here. Now, this generally has a video in it that's gonna show you kinda how to use the template, and a lot of times, these are pretty helpful. They were helpful to me, but at some times, they're also a little confusing too, so that's why I'm making this video. But check out the videos in the help folder. They usually do help you out a little bit, and there's also some notes in here, sometimes, in a little PDF. You can take a look at those, and that might help you out as well. You do have a folder with instructions, and if I open this guy up, this is what the instructions look like. I did watch these in the past, and honestly, I didn't find them all that helpful. I thought the video in the help folder was more helpful than these links right here, but nonetheless, they're there. You can check them out if you need them. The other thing you need to do is take your music, and I like to put it in the same folder here so I know where it is. So this is the song that we downloaded that said it went with this particular intro, so I put it in the same folder, and you see that this particular song came with a long, middle, and short-length song. So we got those in there, but that's what we're gonna be using for the music. So the first thing's first, let's load this guy up into Venture Resolve, and then we're gonna wanna take our media and bring it into the project. Getting your media together, that's a whole separate thing. You gotta find whatever clips and media you might wanna use. Could be photos, could be videos, could be motion graphics, whatever it is you wanna use. In this case, we're gonna be using some video clips, but make sure you've got your stuff rounded up and ready to go to bring into the project. So when you first open Resolve, I get the project manager here, and I'm in a folder where I wanna put this template. So in order to load it up, all you have to do is come into your project manager, you wanna right-click, and then we wanna restore project archive. Go ahead and click on that. Now you wanna navigate to wherever you put that folder that we first downloaded, right? Cause what we wanna do is find this, the dynamic glitch.dra file. So the file we just talked about, that's what we want to load up. So once you find it, go ahead and click on it, and then hit open. The Venture Resolve is gonna load up that project for you, and then we're gonna be able to start editing it. So once it's loaded into Resolve, you're gonna see it appear in your projects here, and this is the one that we did. We did Dynamic Glitch Promo. Now you can leave it as it is, you can come and right-click on it and rename it. I'm just gonna rename this guy. I'm gonna hit okay, so now it's gonna get renamed so that way I can have it called whatever I want. Now you're just gonna select it, and go ahead and hit open. So now the Resolve's open, let's take a look at this template. And just so we're all looking at the same thing, I'm gonna come up to Workspace, and I am going to come down to Reset UI Layout. So I'm in the Edit page right here. I always do all my work in the Edit page. We wanna open up the Media Pool, so open that guy up, and in here we have our bins, master, and we see we've got a dropdown. Now in the master, we've got three different folders here. We have Edit, Render, and Assets. So let's just open these guys up, take a quick look. So under Edit, we have different things in there that we can edit. We have logos, and each one of these folders has timelines in it, and that's kinda how these things are built. They're all built as separate timelines, and then those timelines are put together to create the overall intro. So for example, we've got two logos here. You can edit your text. There's 12 different pieces of text that you can edit. Next it says Edit Images. Now in this case, you can use either images or videos. It doesn't matter which one. They'll both come up and look pretty cool in the video here. So I'm gonna use videos, but if you have images, you can use images too. And would work the same way with any of the slideshow templates. You can use either images or you can use videos. It's up to you guys, you can do either way. So the next option we have here is Render. Go ahead and open that up, and inside of Render, we have the final renderer. So in there, there's two different timelines, and we're gonna see which one is the one that we're gonna wanna use once we get going here. The third folder here is Assets. This is the different assets that help make up the template. Most of the time, you don't have to do anything with these unless you wanna make some modifications, but most of the time, you can just leave it. So you've got footage. This is all the different little effects that they have in the template here that you'll see in the video. You've got media, and generally they have placeholders in here that hold the spot for things that you're gonna put in there. And then in here, it looks like all compounds, there's compound clips and stuff. Now we shouldn't have to do anything with any of those. You should be able to just leave them as it is. So you can just kinda close up that assets folder and not worry about it. So the first thing we need to do is actually bring in some of our footage. So in order to do that, I'm gonna make a new bin. So I'm gonna come over here to Master, I'm gonna right click, and then I'm gonna add new bin. I'm just gonna call this My Footage. So now go navigate to wherever your footage is, and then drag and drop it into our bin. So I've got a whole bunch of cool race car footage, and that's what we're gonna be using to make this cool intro. All right, so let's get started working with these guys. What do you need to know to start working with them? Well, one thing I like to do is keep the final render timeline open, so that way I can work in the smaller timelines, and then see how it's looking in the overall video, or the overall intro. So I have the final renderer open in the timeline, but let's just say if I didn't have any open here, it just says select timeline, you can hit your little drop down here and go to final renderer, or you can just come to your render bin inside final render, and it's right here, I can just double click it, and it's gonna open in the timeline. So one thing you need to do sometimes with some of these templates is clear your render cache. So it doesn't seem like you have to do that on all of them, but some of them you do. So playback, delete render cache, all, and then just go ahead and hit delete. That's gonna kind of clean out anything that's in there, and we're good to go to start with our own stuff. So the first thing that I like to do is work in the timelines where I have to put my footage in. So this way we can start to build it out and see what it looks like. To do that, I'm gonna come on up to my edit bin, click on edit images, and these are, if I just change the way the list looks here, you have edit image one through 12. So this is the order that they would appear in the intro. So what I like to do is just go through and double click all of them to open them all up at once. That way they're there in tabs, and it's just easier to work with, I think. Now if you're not seeing your tabs down here in your timeline, you can always come to your timeline view options, and make sure this first one here is clicked on. That way you're gonna see all the tabs across the top there. And you can cycle through them. There's little arrows here on the ends. You can cycle through to get to the ones you wanna see. I'm gonna start with edit image one. Now sometimes you're gonna see a placeholder in here, and the placeholder is something that you can delete. You don't need to leave that in there. And other times it's just gonna be blank like this. So now what I'm gonna do is come to my footage, and I'm just gonna look at my clips, and I'm just gonna start to build out a little sequence here. I'm gonna put one clip per timeline. Where it says edit image one, that's a timeline. I'm gonna put one clip in there. The next one, I'm gonna put one clip. So one clip in all these guys. Or I mean you could put multiple clips, but you don't need to go crazy. You can use one clip if you want. So I know I wanna start out with this guy here. So I'm gonna set my in point, play through the video a little bit, out point, drag it down into my timeline. So there we go, first clip in, we're good to go. Next one, I know I wanna use this clip right here. I'm gonna set my in points and out points. That looks pretty good. Now one tip, it's gonna vary on how long these clips need to be. For some of the templates here, the clips can be really short. They don't have to be that long, because it's flipping through stuff really quick. In other ones, you need the clip to be a little bit longer. It just depends on the particular template that you're using. So we already got two clips in here. Now how do I see what it looks like? Because right now I just have one timeline that I'm working on and I'm dumping in one clip. So what am I looking at here, right? Well this is where you wanna come back to your final renderer. And you wanna play through it and that's where you should be able to start to see your intro come together. So you can see there's our first clip, there's our second clip. And you can see everything else is happening automatically. It's all part of the template. The text that's there, the little glitches that are happening. Now there's no audio yet, because we're gonna have to add that in a little bit. But our clips are all getting put together. It's part of the template. So when we look at this final render, it's our final product essentially. So I'm just gonna go ahead and cruise through the rest of my timelines along the top here, my edit image three, four, five, six, all the way through the end. And I'm gonna pop in my clips that I want to make the little sequence that I want. So I'm gonna do that real quick. You guys should go try it with your clips if you have any. And in about half a second I'll be done here and then we'll move on to the next step. All right, so I went through all these timelines. I put in my clips and now we're gonna take a look at the final render and see how that looks. So let's click on here. Now if it plays back a little glitchy, sometimes you might need to play through it once for it to kind of render up. You can also come back up to your playback settings, timeline proxy mode and change that if you need to. I like to put the render cache on the smart. So you can do that too. And you can give it a second to render up. But anyway, here's what the intro is looking like so far. So one of the things that you notice is that we don't have any sound yet. So we're gonna put in some sound and we need to edit this text here. And I also noticed there's something that I might wanna take out which is that logo in the beginning. It's not my logo, maybe I wanna dump my logo in there. So we're gonna change out the logo as well. All right, so next step, let's start working on some of our text. So in order to find our text, what we need to do is come back into our media pool, into our edit bin and we have edit texts. Go ahead and click on that. I'm just gonna change my view here to the list view. And now you can see we have edit text one through 12. Which corresponds to the one through 12 where we put in our video clip. So if I come back to my timeline here, I'm just gonna hit the little X on all of these video clip timelines so I can just close them up because I don't need them anymore at the moment. And I'm just gonna go through my edit text and just open all these guys up. So now we have all of our text timelines open. Now here's a pretty cool little tip for you. Since we go back and forth a lot between, you know, the timeline that we're editing in and the final one, because we wanna see what it looks like, right? You can have two timelines up on your screen at a time. So here's what I do. When you have this view right here, if you come on over to the right, you've got this little square with a plus. Click on that and that's gonna open up two timelines. So in this top timeline, I'm gonna go back a little bit here. I'm gonna close this final render timeline because I wanna open that in the timeline on the bottom. So I'm gonna come over here, gonna select this. And you notice that it doesn't appear there, where is it? So as long as I click down into this area down here for this timeline, I'm gonna come back to final renderer and open my final render timeline. Just double click it and it's gonna open it up in your bottom timeline. So I like to keep this here because it just makes it easy for me to jump back and forth between the two timelines to see what I'm doing and how I'm editing this template. So let's get into adding some text. I'm gonna go all the way back to edit text one and this is gonna say glitch. Now, if I just click down in my final render timeline, I'm gonna move ahead. So it's gonna say glitch when it's on top of this guy. So we're gonna come up with some text. I don't know, what do we wanna say in here? Just clicking back up on the text up here, will bring me back into that timeline. Gonna open up my inspector to edit the text. And we can add in whatever we want. I'm gonna say the need. And that's it, that's all I'm gonna do on that one. Now I'm gonna come to my text two and I'm gonna select my text and I'm gonna come up here and say for speed. Now let's see, how is this looking, right? We don't know, we wanna know. So click down in your final render timeline and you could leave your final render timeline up here with all the rest of them and just flip back and forth. Whatever works best for you guys, I just find this way is pretty quick and convenient. So let's play it, see what it's looking like. All right, I think it's looking good so far. It was a little glitchy cause it's rendering. You get the idea. Now I'm gonna go through the rest of my text tabs up here and add in text. So I must speed through that. We'll be done in half a second here and you're gonna see what it's looking like so far. Now real quick, since I'm editing another one here, what if it's a little too big like that? You can always change the size of your text. You can edit any of these options that you have here in the inspector. So this one's a little big. I'm gonna scale that down a little bit. So I'm gonna go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and scale that down a little bit. And there you go, you're good to go. Likewise, if you wanted to replace any of your fonts, you could do that, change it and make it whatever you want. Okay, so I got through all my text. I added it in there, just kind of made up some stuff that I thought looked cool. Now I'm gonna come down to my bottom timeline and I'm gonna let it render up for a second here. We're gonna play through and let's see what it's looking like so far. Okay, so not too bad, right? So one thing I do wanna do is I wanna get rid of that logo that's in the front here, so right there. I don't want that in there, so how do we do that? Well, in our bins over here, we do have edit logos. So let's open that up and see what's in there. I'm gonna double click on it. That actually opened it in the same section down here as my render timeline, cause that's what was selected. So we've got a logo in there now. It's just a static image, let's say, I wanna get rid of that. So I'm gonna go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and click back on that piece of logo. It should decisions change that. It just reminds me of, it's literally one to two漂 broker Upper мет μποirts, one to appreciation. That's the extraordinary thing about aamer 문21. And this, by the way, is filled with a number of types of code that people use. Or how do we do that? You're gonnaMUSIC of edit logo. It's gonna tease me trying on a change of field, you know what I mean, Okay, so this is the other logo the motion ray logo that's at the end of the video I'm gonna leave that in there since this video sponsored by motion ray speaking of motion ray motion ray is awesome I've been using their service for a while now and actually I've had an account for years, but they are awesome There is so much good stuff on there.

Ah, there's my logo in there. Alright, that works out pretty good So now we want to add in some audio now Sometimes you're gonna find that there is an actually an audio timeline Right over here under edit and in this case, I don't see that that's fine not a big deal But sometimes you will see an audio timeline So I'm gonna go ahead and close my top timeline there because I just want my final renderer timeline open close these logo guys So now all I have to do is add in that song that goes along with this template So inside of my folder here like I talked about earlier we put our music I don't know if I need the long middle or short so I'm just gonna take them all and I'm gonna drag them into my Footage bin over here in DaVinci Resolve now. I'm just gonna take let's start with I'm gonna try the short one actually and drop that down into my timeline here zoom out a little bit Now you can see it's a little bit longer than my clip But let's let's give this a listen and see how it sounds. Let me get my headphones. Alright headphones on suit it up Let's see what we got I So that's pretty cool now one thing you did notice or at least I noticed is that the music started a little early So we need to adjust that a little bit. So if we play through let's just listen in here So it started right when the logo popped in now if you watch the template on their website It actually starts a little bit later So what I want to do is come and just go ahead right when it comes to this part That's where I want the music to start so so I can see my waveform I'm gonna click on my timeline view options make my audio track a little bit bigger come down here drag this up a little bit So I can see it comes in it hits right there and I move this guy over a little bit a little quick tip You can use the period and comma key to move it frame by frame select your clip period and comma to move it frame by frame Nice little tip there for you. I use that all the time. So let's see how that sounds Perfect now we see that that beat is lined up with our our image on the screen Let's play through it now and see see if it looks a little bit better here I One thing I'm gonna do I'm gonna open my mixer and just check my levels cuz I think it's hopefully not blowing your ears off So what I'm gonna do is actually just right click on here real quick come down and normalize audio levels Just to do this real quick hit normalize and now we should be getting better levels So let's just watch our meter listen through and see what it looks like Okay, now you do notice that the audio clip is longer than our Intro here, and I'm sure that all these other ones will be even longer Yeah, a little longer there and the long one is really long now Sometimes it's great because you can have a little extra after the video clips done so that you can transition into whatever the next part Of your video is and so I kind of like having a little extra there But let's say maybe you didn't want that all you got to do is find a good spot Where the beat is going and you want to cut our audio clip and then we could just scooch it in a little bit So that's the basics of setting up this template here What I usually do is I'll set this up and then I'll export out this intro so I just have one clip I can go dump into my regular project that I'm making for my YouTube video So to do that you can just come on over to the deliver tab you can set up your settings. I like to use custom settings I've got a few presets here got a 1081 pick where you want it to go I'm gonna hit browse and give it a name hit save and then you can set up your settings However, you want go ahead and add it to the render queue then hit render all and you'll render out the video You'll have one clip that you could just bring into any project and you can have an awesome intro It makes it super easy to work with once you did the hard part of putting together the whole intro So that's it in a nutshell. It's super easy now a couple tips here The one thing that I've done before and I like to do is I don't know if you saw this video recently But I love me some drop shadow on some of my tech sometimes I think it just helps it pop and in this situation. I think it can also help this text pop So if you're working through some of these templates and you have questions drop a comment down below And I'm more than happy to go download a particular template You might be working on take a look at it and help you out if you kind of get stuck But once you do a few of them you'll get the hang of it and really it's not that bad It's pretty easy and it really helps to level up the intros for your videos. So that wraps it up for this one guys Thank you so much to motion array for sponsoring this video for having an awesome service really appreciate you guys motion array and With that said guys if you liked this video you'll learn just a little something Go ahead and give this video thumbs up for me subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and I look forward to seeing you guys in the next one Oh, if you guys make an intro drop a link down below. I'd love to go check it out. All right guys. We'll see in the next one. Peace You
