When you're working in DaVinci Resolve here, it's important to stay organized. And in this quick tip Tuesday, I'm gonna show you one way we can move tracks around really quick and stay organized. Let's check this out. In DaVinci Resolve right here, I've got a project that I worked on with Casey a little while back about Star Wars. We added in all kinds of cool sound design and music and all kinds of fun stuff. But let's say we need to organize or move some tracks around a little bit. We can do that really quick and easy. I'm in the Edit tab right here. I wanna come up to the Index. And under Index, we have tracks. I'm gonna make this just a little bit bigger here. And we can see all of our tracks. You can even see all of the audio tracks that I named here. We've got music, music delays, tie fighters, all kinds of good stuff. If we wanted to move around our tracks a little bit, I can select, let's say our tie fighter tracks, select them all and I'm gonna click, hold and drag to move them somewhere else. So I'm gonna click, hold and drag. And let's say I want them to be all the way at the bottom. Boom, it puts all those tracks right at the bottom. I don't have to come over here and do like we used to have to do, right click, move track up, move track down. Now we can just come in here, grab whatever track or tracks that we want using your Shift key to select multiple tracks in a row or you can use your Command or Control key to select different tracks like this. And then you can just grab them and move them wherever that you would like. So for example here, maybe I want the Sith Saber. I wanna move that down here right below this guy. Boom, I'm gonna drop it in and it moves the track real easy for us. One of those little quality of life things here in DaVinci Resolve, it just makes your job easier when you've got to shuffle some stuff around. So that is today's Quick Tip Tuesday. Thank you for tuning in. And if there's anything you wanna see in particular, be sure to drop me a comment. Let me know because I wanna make stuff you guys wanna see. Oh, by the way, if you wanna see how to edit this whole Star Wars video, I'll link that up here. You can check it out. And Casey has a great video on how to do all the cool video portion of that little Star Wars clip. I'll link that down below somewhere too. So check that out. And with that said, that wraps up this Quick Tuesday. I will see you in the next video. Thanks.
