I am super excited today to be releasing my audio course, Audio Essentials for Video Editors in DaVinci Resolve. A lot of you guys have asked over the years, where is the course? I want audio course, Jay, don't you got something? Well, now I do. I've spent months working on this, putting together outlines and just designing a course that's gonna help you understand the whys as well as the hows behind audio editing. It's gonna help you just take your audio to the next level, make it sound better, we're gonna take care of problems, and really just get you from beginning to awesome audio in this course. So if you are a beginner, this course is perfect for you, and if you're an intermediate user, you've edited some audio, you've dabbled in it a little bit, but you wanna learn more, this course is for you. So I just wanted to talk about it a little bit today and share it with you guys. If you're interested, you can hit up the link in the description below, check it out. Or maybe you've got a friend that might be interested in learning about audio, you could shoot the link over to them. So I've spent months working on this and trying to put together the best class that I could for you guys. So I've got over four hours of training that you can watch, and the videos are all broken down into five different parts with multiple lessons in each part. So I've got 27 videos here that you're gonna be able to go through step by step to learn each part of the audio process, to help take you through different things you need to learn. And finally, by the end of the video, you're gonna have some awesome audio for whatever project you might be working on. In addition to all of the video files that you'll get to work through and learn about audio editing, I've included a bunch of downloadable files for you. One is a DaVinci Resolve file where you can follow along with the project, you'll get the files that we're working with throughout the course, so that way you can follow along and work with me side by side to see how the changes we're making to our audio effect, the audio that we're working on. I've got PDF cheat sheets in there that you can take a look at that are gonna help guide you when you're trying to make audio decisions. I've got a full PDF outline of the course where you can jump from part to part with any video in case you only need a specific thing, you can figure out where you need to go find that. And I'm also including 40 EQ presets that you can use and download and put right into DaVinci Resolve. So now I just wanna show you the landing page, what it looks like, and then I'm gonna jump inside the course so you can see what the course looks like. So you know what you'll be getting into if you decide to go ahead and purchase it. So here's the landing page right here. It's actually a part of DV Resolve, and I couldn't have put this course together without my buddy, Godali, who runs DV Resolve. And he really helped me a lot with the backend stuff, so I really appreciate you, Godali, thank you for helping me put all of this together. So here we've got the landing page, audio essentials for video editors in DaVinci Resolve. Course is $79, and here's what you'll get. You get a DaVinci Resolve project file, you get practice media, there's 27 video lessons, which is four hours worth of training. You have a lifetime access to the course. So if we put out some updates, maybe there's some new features that come out in Fairlight or in Resolve that would apply to this course. So go ahead, create a video, add it to the course, and you're gonna have access to that forever. You're gonna learn the ins and outs of Fairlight, and I am including the 40 Fairlight presets. So we're gonna talk about a lot of different stuff in the course here, like balancing levels, fixing problems, mixing, sweetening, and all kinds of different tips and tricks that are just gonna help take your audio to the next level. Now if you go and purchase the course, once you do, you're gonna get a homepage that looks like this, it's gonna have any courses that you may have purchased through DV Resolve right here. And if you need some help, there's an email right down here, hello at dvresolve.com, you can shoot them a note. But to get into the course, you just click on Audio Essentials for Video Editors, our little image right here. This is what it looks like once you're inside the course, we have our main window here where you can watch the course and go through the lessons. And then on the right hand side here, you've got a little progress bar, so you know how far you've gotten through the course. And then we've got each section. So we've got our intro with all of our lessons underneath it. You just click each lesson, you can go through at your leisure in whatever order that you want. I do suggest that you start at the top and work your way down, but if you've gone through it once or you only need help in a specific area, just jump to that area. So we can see the different parts up here and then each lesson underneath, you can just click on it and jump right to that lesson. Now let's talk about getting those extra things that come with the course. If you scroll down to the bottom here, we see downloads and under downloads, we've got our practice media. So right here, you've got practice media that will come in a DRA file. If you don't know how to open up and load a DRA file, here's a video for you to tell you how to do it. But you're gonna get the media that I used in the examples here, as well as a DaVinci Resolve file with a few timelines in it. So that way you can just open that up and follow along with the different lessons as you work your way through the course. Then we've got some download cheat sheets here. We've got a course outline that'll give you bullets of what's in every lesson. I've got some great keyboard shortcuts that are gonna speed up your editing. A PDF of EQ tips. And in here, I'm gonna talk about some different things to keep in mind when you're trying to EQ your clips, as well as some frequency ranges where you wanna look for problems that you might be hearing, but you aren't sure where to find them. I've also got a document that shows you the EQ settings I used in the lesson itself. So if you aren't sure what to do or how to edit the audio that's in the practice file, you can just check out this PDF, see what I did. You can do the same thing, and then see how it sounds, make some changes if you need to. Then I've also got a blank printable note sheet for you here that you can use to print out as many sheets as you need. Keep some notes while you're going through the course. That way you can remember things. And finally, we've got the Fairlight EQ presets. You can go ahead and download these. There's instructions in there on how to get them installed on your machine. And once you're in DaVinci Resolve, you've got 40 EQ presets that you can use as a starting point for editing your audio. So I'm really excited about this course, guys. I put a lot of time and a lot of effort into it, trying to make it the best I can, straightforward, easy to understand, and just give you guys a lot of value for the purchase price of the course. So if you're looking to take your audio to the next level, and this looks like something that might be helpful to you, hit up the link in the description below, check it out.
