Sometimes when we're building our film, we've got shots that don't really match up. And Indivintory's all, if we need to make them look like they all came from the same location, they were filmed at the same time, even though maybe they didn't. In this video, I'm going to show you exactly how we can do that fast and easy in the color tab. Let's check it out. Indivintory's all here. I put together this cool little edit just for something fun to do of a crime scene investigation. And most of these clips came from the same place, but there were a few clips I added in that didn't match. For example, this one right here, the guy getting arrested, as well as this one right here of the person getting thrown in jail. Now, if we look at my other clips here, we can see they kind of have a bright, warm cream kind of color to them. But the one where the guy's getting arrested and the one where they're getting locked up doesn't, especially this one right here. We can see it's got a much bluer tone to it. Now, we can do a whole bunch of number of things, but the shot match is going to do the quickest and easiest job for you here. So jump over into the color tab here. Now, in the color tab here, the first thing you want to do is select the clip for the shot that you want to match. Next, I'm going to come and find a clip in my timeline that already has the look that I want. So for example, I know that this one right here, I kind of like the look of that it's got the cream colors, the lighting looks good. That's the one that I want to match. So select the clip you want to match, and then come to the one you want to match from right click. And then you're going to come down to shot match to this clip. And once I do that, look at this clip up here, it took the blue, it changed the colors in there, and it matched it to this one. Now it looks like this clip goes right along with all these other clips that I've got in my timeline here, right? They all have that, you know, kind of hot spot, warm cream kind of color to it. And this one right here now matches right in. Now we could do the exact same thing here for this clip where the person's getting arrested. So let's say I want to use the same clip, I'm going to right click on there, come down to shot match to this clip. And now it's perfect, right? It matches look the light here is that same warm kind of cream color. And it looks great, right? Now it might be a little bright, maybe I want to darken it down a little, you can make you know, further adjustments here, if you want, that's perfectly fine. But this is a really quick way to match shots. And even these two right here with the bones, they did not come from this same series of recordings that the original investigation stuff did. So if I just select both of these, and then I'm going to come and right click on my shot over here and match shot to this clip. And now you can see it added in those colors. And it looks like it fits right in. And again, you can adjust, you know, your brightness and your contrast and that kind of stuff a little bit. But using that shot match just takes the guesswork out of trying to figure out, okay, what do I do here? How do I get it to match? What colors do I have to add in shot match? A lot of times is going to work good for you. Well disclaimer, it's not going to work 100% of the time, but give it a shot because if it does work, that saves you a lot of work. And then you could just create more nodes, adjust your color green, your contrast, your brightness, darkness, whatever you might need to do, adjust it how you need, and then boom, you are off and running. So shot match really cool here, individually solved, especially if you filmed in different locations at different times, and you want it to look like it was all done at the same time. Use it, love it, and speed up your workflow. With that said, I'm going to roll this little crime scene investigation for you and I will see you in the next video. Peace.
