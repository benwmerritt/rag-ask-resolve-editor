These 25 keyboard shortcuts in Davinci Resolve are gonna speed up your editing and literally save you hours and hours of clicking. Let's jump in Resolve. We're in Davinci Resolve and I'm in the Edit tab. The first keyboard shortcut is this. If you wanna jump around Davinci Resolve really quick and easy, you're gonna wanna use your Shift key and all of the number keys. Shift number one is gonna bring up your project manager. Shift number two is gonna bring you to the Media tab. Shift number three is gonna bring you to the Cut tab. Shift number four is gonna bring you to the Edit tab. Shift number five is gonna bring you to Fusion. Shift number six is going to bring you to the Color tab. Shift number seven is gonna bring you to Fusion. Shift number eight is gonna bring you to the Deliver tab and Shift number nine is gonna go ahead and bring up your project settings. So believe it or not, that's all part of tip number one. I know a lot of keyboard shortcuts in there, but that's all tip number one. And I'm gonna use Shift number four to get back to the Edit page. Tip number two here, zooming in and out on your timeline. Now you can do this with your mouse, but the keyboard shortcut is this, Command or Control plus zooms in, Command or Control minus zooms out. I use these all the time. It's probably the most frequently used zooming tool in Davinci Resolve on my timeline here. And that is Command and Control plus and minus to zoom in and out. The next tip is when you need to move your play head one frame to the left or to the right. I do this all the time. And if you just use your arrow keys, it's gonna move the play head frame by frame to the left and to the right. Zoom in so we can see it a little bit better, moving frame to frame to the right and frame to by frame to the left. The next keyboard shortcut is if you want to jump your play head one second ahead or back, you're gonna go ahead and hold your Shift key and use the arrow keys. And that's gonna jump you ahead one second. You look at my timecode over there, we're jumping forward and backward one second by holding Shift and your arrow keys. The next keyboard shortcut here is moving a clip frame by frame to the left or to the right. To do that, you're gonna select your clip and you're gonna use your period and comma keys to bump it left and right. So with your clip selected, the comma key is gonna bump your clip one frame at a time to the left. And the period key is gonna bump it one frame to the right so that you can place it exactly where you need it. Use that one all the time. Tip number six is moving your play head from key frame to key frame on a clip. Check this out. So on this clip right here, I've got some key frames and I can see them by clicking on the little diamond. See my key frames here. And if I wanna move the play head to the key frames, I can use the bracket keys to move from key frame to key frame. So the left bracket key moves your play head left to the key frames, your right bracket key moves the play head to the right. So you can easily and quickly jump right to any one of the key frames. If you have your clip not on a key frame, you just hit that bracket key and it's gonna automatically jump the play head right to one of those key frames. Then go ahead and make any changes you might need to. Keyboard shortcut number seven is this. If I wanna select everything in my timeline, really quick and easy, your play head can be wherever you want and I'm gonna use command or control A. And that's gonna select everything in my timeline. I can then move everything all at once by just clicking and dragging it to wherever I want it to be. I use that one all the time. Actually, I use all these keyboard shortcuts all the time if I'm being honest. Keyboard shortcut number eight is when you want to put your play head in a specific spot on the timeline and select everything forward from the play head, there's a keyboard shortcut for that. In this case, I've got my play head right here. I wanna select everything in front of that. I'm gonna use option Y and it's gonna select everything past the play head. Now, one little caveat to that is that if your clip goes behind the play head, kinda like this music clip here, it's gonna select that too. So you'd either have to make a cut here or if you didn't wanna select your music clip, you could just hold your command key or control key and just deselect that one particular clip. Then you can grab all those other clips and move them wherever you might like. Keyboard shortcut number nine is if you want to do the opposite, take that play head and select everything before it. Get my play heads right here in the timeline. I'm gonna use command Y and it's gonna select everything before that. Now, if it is touching a clip, sometimes it's gonna grab that extra clip like it did right here. So to deselect that, I can just use my command or control key, click on that and then it gets deselected. And now I can take these clips and do whatever I want with them. Keyboard shortcut number 10 is disabling a clip. And I do this all the time when I'm trying to see what I wanna put where in my timeline. So for example, if I've got this clip right here and it's on top of this one and I wanna kinda see what's going on underneath it, I'm gonna hit the letter D to disable the clip. And this way I can see what's going on underneath it. Now this will disable both the video and the audio. So you might wanna turn it back on and you can always change the opacity or the video portion of the clip if you don't wanna see the clip, but you want the audio. But the letter D is gonna disable any clip that you select. You can disable as many as you want and you just hit letter D to re-enable that clip whenever you might want to. Oh, by the way, I have all of these written down in a PDF document that you can go ahead and download from my Shopify store. So if you want that freebie, head on over there, check it out, you can download it, have all these written down. And it'll make it nice and easy for you to have a little list that you can use these keyboard shortcuts while you're working. Keyboard shortcut number 10 here is a three-part shortcut and that is the JK and L keys. I use these all the time, probably more than anything else when I'm trying to play through my timeline. Forward, backwards, slow-mo, stop, fast, fast forward. So here's how you do it. The L key is gonna play forward in your timeline. If you press it multiple times, it'll speed up the playback. K is going to stop the playback and J is gonna play in reverse. And again, we can press J a few times and it's gonna go backwards even quicker. I'm gonna press K to stop. And if I wanted to go frame by frame, I could hold the letter K and press the J or L keys. And then if I use L, I'm gonna go forward frame by frame. And if I use J, I'm gonna go backwards frame by frame. And keep in mind that's pressing the K key, hold it down and then press J and L and it'll bump you one way or the other, depending on which key you use. So that's pretty much how I always navigate around the timeline when I'm playing back. I use the space bar to play forward sometimes. Most of the time it's JK and L and my hands are always there to move forwards, backwards, fast forward, and just get the playhead to where I want it to be in the timeline. Keyboard shortcut number 12 here is probably familiar to you. It is copy and paste and paste attributes, which is one of my favorite keyboard shortcuts. So in resolve here, I can select a clip. I can use command or control C and then I can use command or control V to paste that clip. But you notice it writes over top of my existing clips in my video track one. One way around that is to either lock my number track, track number one, or I can turn off the auto track selector here, which makes that track not respond to things like copying, pasting, cutting and that kind of stuff. And this way if I now paste it using command or control V, it'll paste it into track number two. So that's your normal copy and paste. Now paste attributes, one of my favorites here is a way to take the attributes of the clip like your zoom, your scale, your whatever you might have done to your clip, copy that and paste it onto another clip. So in order to do that, I'm gonna come to a clip where I made a few changes. So this clip right here, you can see in the inspector, I changed the zoom a little bit. I changed the pitch a little bit and let's just for fun, we'll rotate it, we'll do that. So I wanna copy these attributes, right? So in order to do that, I'm gonna select my clip, use my standard copy, which is command or control C. And I'm gonna go to the new clip that I want to paste these attributes to, and I'm gonna use option or alt plus the letter V. Then I'm gonna get this right here and it's gonna allow me to select the things that I want to paste the attributes I wanna paste onto this new clip. So most of the time I'm gonna use all the settings that I have. I'm gonna click all the video attributes, but if you don't want everything to copy and paste, you can just select the ones you wanna paste. It's pretty easy. And then just hit apply and boom, there we go. I've got the attributes from my one clip, pasted onto my other clip. I use that one all the time, like all the time, every video, all the time. Since we're talking about keyboard shortcuts really quick, did you guys know that Logic Keyboard makes a keyboard that's got all of the DaVinci Resolve shortcuts on there? Well, not all of them, but a lot of them. This keyboard is pretty good. I mean, I've been using it for a while. I like it a lot. And if you're looking to learn the keyboard shortcuts, you might wanna pick up a keyboard like this because all you have to do is look at it. It tells you whether you gotta use the shift, the command, the control, the option, the alt, plus whatever key tells you which ones you gotta do with what and what combinations. So it's really handy to help you learn how to use the keyboard shortcuts, help you remember what they are, cause you just have to look right in front of you. You don't even have to try and figure it out. So I just wanna throw that in there. If you need a cool keyboard, that works nice and has the DaVinci Resolve keyboard shortcuts on it, you might wanna check out the DaVinci Resolve keyboard. And no, it's not sponsored. I just been using the keyboard for a little while and that's why I thought to make this video. So check it out if you're interested. I'll leave a link in the description below. Keyboard shortcut number 13 here is one of my faves. I've actually remapped this to two different keyboard shortcuts instead of the default keyboard shortcuts cause it was a little too many keys, like three keys. So I changed it to the letter Q and the letter W, but here's what it is. We wanna make a cut and ripple delete our clips to the left or to the right. So if I'm hovering over a clip here and I wanna make a cut right here and delete this portion of the clip and ripple delete, so it means push everything over in the timeline, I'm gonna press my Q key and it'll make a cut and ripple delete, push everything over. And if I undo that, if I use my W key, it's going to make a cut and delete everything to the right. So make a cut here and delete everything on this side. And then it slides everything over for me. Now I remapped those keyboard shortcuts myself. If you wanna see what your shortcut is for this particular feature here, if you just come on up to the trim menu and then you come down to ripple and right here you're gonna see start to play head and end to play head. So I remapped them to Q and W. The default is something like shift command bracket or something like that. You'll see right here, it'll say whatever yours is and if it's the default, it's gonna say it right here. But I remapped mine to W and Q because it makes it a little bit quicker when I'm trying to edit quickly. Just to add in another keyboard shortcut here, I remapped the razor tool. So this right here, by default, it says it's B. I remapped this to be S. So when I wanna go through my timeline quickly, I can put my play head wherever I want. I can press S to make a cut. I can move ahead a little bit. Then I can use Q and W to quickly edit different points in my clip here or my timeline. And it just allows me to edit real quickly using three fingers. So I can put a finger on the Q, the W and the S and just go through and edit really quickly. So that's a little extra bonus there, remapping the razor tool to the S key and just being able to just kinda cruise through real quick and make cuts and then ripple, delete, forward and backward. I use those all the time. Keyboard shortcut number 14 is trim to start and trim to end. So this comes in handy if you have your play head somewhere on a clip and you wanna delete the first part of the clip or the second part of the clip, either before or after the play head, but not move anything, we do have the ability to be able to do that with a keyboard shortcut. In order to use this keyboard shortcut, you're gonna go ahead and select your clip. You're gonna hold shift and the bracket key, if you use the left bracket key, it's gonna delete the left portion of your clip. Just gonna undo that real quick. And if we use shift and our right bracket key, gonna select the clip, shift, right bracket, it's gonna delete the right hand side of the clip. So really handy if you don't want anything to move, you just wanna cut and delete the rest of the clip, either before or after the play head. That's the keyboard shortcut to do it. Keyboard shortcut number 15, let's say you wanted to just delete a clip, but you didn't want anything else in your timeline to move. Here's how you do it. Come in your timeline, select your clip, and then just hit your backspace key, not the delete key, if you got a big keyboard, the backspace key, and it's gonna delete the clip and leave everything else where it is. You can see now I've got a hole in my timeline there. Now if I undo that with command or control Z, which is another keyboard shortcut, not on my list, command or control Z, bone is for you there, I think most people know that, right? That's the undo, control Z on a PC there, or did you know this one? Shift, command, Z, or shift, control Z, is gonna redo. So if you undo, and then you want to redo, you've got shift, command, or control Z to redo. So yeah, those are just some bonus ones there for ya. Literally, there's so many great keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard shortcut number 16 here is if you wanted to delete the clip and push everything over in your timeline, so you wanna ripple delete that particular clip. In your timeline, come in and select your clip, and you're gonna use the delete key, not the backspace key, to delete that clip and move everything over. Boom, there you go. Now if you don't have the bigger keyboard that has that separate delete key and the backspace key, what you're gonna wanna do is probably use like a, there's probably a function button or a, I don't know, I don't know what it is on PC. On a Mac, it's a function button, and then you can use your backspace key and it'll do the ripple delete instead of just deleting the clip and leaving a gap in your timeline. Keyboard shortcut number 17 is this, sometimes when you're scrubbing around with your audio, put my headphones on here, you wanna hear your audio like this, right? Especially if you're scrubbing around dialogue. Now if you use Shift S, that is gonna turn on and off your audio scrubbing. Sometimes you want it, sometimes you don't, and a lot of times you just hit this keyboard shortcut by mistake and then you're like, why can't I hear my audio when I'm scrubbing around my playhead? So Shift S is gonna turn it on and off. We hear it now and if I hit Shift S, nothing. And a lot of times this gets hit by mistake and then you can't figure out why can't I hear my audio, there's no audio, what's the deal? Although when you play it back, it still works okay, but that Shift S is gonna turn on and off your audio scrubbing, so that's a really handy one to know. Keyboard shortcut number 18 here, y'all love your transitions, right? You wanna be able to drop in a transition with a keyboard shortcut, as all it has you covered. So when your playhead is in between two clips, you can just select it by either windowing both or you can just hover over the intersection with this little icon there and you click it, it lights up green, use Command or Control on a PC, the letter T, boom, there's your transition. Now what transition does it apply? It's gonna apply whatever your default transition is. If you're not sure what your default transition is, just open your effects library really quickly. Come to Video Transitions and you wanna look for the one that's got this little red mark right here. That's gonna tell you that's your default transition. By default, it's a cross fade, but let's say you wanted to change it to something else, you could just come to any transition you want, right click and say set as standard transition, and then that will be your standard transition. So whenever you use that keyboard shortcut, that's the transition that will be applied. Now you can also, as a bonus tip here, you select multiple clips and use Command or Control T. It's gonna allow you to put transitions on all those intersections there or where the clips join. But if you have some clips that start at the very beginning or very into the clips, you might get this message and it's gonna wanna know if Resolve can just trim a little bit off of those clips for you. You can go ahead and say, okay, most of the time, and then boom, there you go, you've got your transitions on there. So adding transitions really quick, either one at a time or multiple at a time there with the keyboard shortcut Command or Control T. Keyboard shortcut number 19, setting in and out points with keyboard shortcuts. I do this all the time, especially if I've got two viewers open and maybe I'm looking through some media trying to find something. I'm gonna use the letter I to set an endpoint and the letter O to set an out point. Not only does this work in my viewers here, but in my timeline, I can do the same thing. I can set an endpoint and an out point using the letters I and O on your keyboard. Really great keyboard shortcut. Why? Well, maybe you wanna set some in and out points so that you can loop this over and over again. So I can turn on my loop right here. And now if I play through this, once it gets to the end of those in and out points, it'll just keep looping the video over and over. So it comes in really handy. Keyboard shortcut number 20 here. You have done this, you've set in and out points and you're like, how do I get rid of these darn things? They're in the way. I don't wanna look at them. Keyboard shortcut for that. If you wanna get rid of them on your timeline, like right here, you're gonna use option or alt X. Boom, it's gonna get rid of those in and out points for you. Same thing up here in your viewers, option or alt X, boom, gets rid of all of those in and out points for you. So that's one thing that drives me nuts. Sometimes I accidentally add in a bunch of in and out points. I don't wanna do that. I'm gonna use that keyboard shortcut to get rid of those in and out points. Works every time. I use it pretty much all the time. All the time. It's a good one. You should use it too. Keyboard shortcut number 21. And that is moving clips up and down in tracks. So if I were to come in here and just select a clip, I wanna move it up a track, right? Yeah, I could click it and drag it up. But what if I wanna do it with a keyboard shortcut? I can do it. You're gonna wanna use option on a Mac or alt on a PC plus your arrow keys. And that's gonna bring the clip straight up and straight down. It's an easy way to just make more tracks. If you go up, it resolves automatically. It's gonna make tracks for you. But you can just move it up and down however you'd like. Same thing with your audio, option or alt and your arrow keys up and down. And it's gonna move them clips up and down in your timeline. You can select multiple clips. If they're staggered, kinda like these guys, it's gonna keep them staggered as I move them up and down. You can select multiple as many as you want and move them up and down tracks. That's a great one. I use that all the time, especially with audio work. When I'm working with sound effects and I wanna move them up and down tracks, get everything situated. That's a really handy keyboard shortcut that I use all the time. Keyboard shortcut number 22 is this. Sometimes I wanna see my beautiful video full screen. So I'm gonna press the letter P on my keyboard and that's gonna make it go full screen for me. I can see the whole thing in all its beautiful glory. And if I wanna go back, I press P again and it goes back into DaVinci Resolve, just how you're normally used to looking at it. So P gives you the cinema viewer and lets you see everything full screen. Keyboard shortcut number 23 here, I use all the time as well. And that is to open the retime controls on a particular clip. Maybe you wanna speed ramp, speed up a clip, slow down a clip, whatever it might be. This is how you do it. Go to any clip in your timeline, select it and use command or control R and that's gonna open up your speed controls. Once that's open, you can do your normal speed controls, select the things that you want. And if you wanna close those speed controls, just hit command or control R again and it's gonna go ahead and close up those speed controls for you. So I love that one. I use it all the time. Instead of jumping into the inspector and using the speed controls there or right clicking and going to retime controls, I use the keyboard shortcut to get to those retime controls command or control R. Keyboard shortcut number 24, adding markers. And that is the letter M. In your timeline, just press the letter M. If you have no clip selected and that's gonna put it on the timeline itself, I use markers all the time for marking out things I need to go back and fix or YouTube chapters, whatever it might be. But the letter M is gonna add it in there. If you have a clip selected, like I select this audio clip and I come over here and I press M, it's gonna add the marker on the clip itself. So with no clip selected, goes on to the timeline, clip selected, the marker goes on to the clip. Now bonus tip here, if you click M twice, then it brings up your little window here where you can rename the marker. You can add in whatever notes you want. So if I was making a new one, I would just press it M twice, brings up my marker window there and I can just put in whatever notes I want, change the color, do any of that stuff. But I use markers like all the time in my YouTube videos, mostly for YouTube chapters, but sometimes too when I have to come back and edit something and I don't wanna forget, but I don't wanna do it at that time, make a marker and give myself a little reminder there of what I need to do, go back to that point, fix this up and then you're good to go. So markers, the letter M. Keyboard shortcut number 25 here is creating a freeze frame. There's sometimes where I wanna make a freeze frame out of one of my video clips and there's a keyboard shortcut to do that. So you wanna put your play head wherever you want it to be and then you're gonna use shift and the letter R. Boom, now this entire clip is a freeze frame. It's not going anywhere, nothing's changing. It's a freeze frame. And as a bonus tip here for you, I forget if I even mentioned this one or not, but zooming the entire timeline, I use this one all the time. If you're in your timeline, you're zoomed in a little bit, you wanna see the whole thing, use shift plus the letter Z and that's gonna zoom out your entire timeline and put it on your screen so that you can see everything all at once there. I use that one all the time. So there you have it, 25 keyboard shortcuts here in DaVinci Resolve 19. If you take the time to learn these keyboard shortcuts, they really do speed up your workflow. When you're trying to navigate around, say I'm having to hunt through menus and click a lot of stuff, the keyboard shortcuts do a great job of really just kind of speeding things up and keeping things rolling for you. I use pretty much all of these all the time and I find it super helpful. And after you do it for a little while, you don't even have to think of it. It's like your muscle memory. You just know where to push in on the keyboard, which keyboard shortcuts to use for what and just makes it quicker and a little bit easier when you're editing all your videos here in DaVinci Resolve. And if you are looking for a new keyboard and you want something that's got the DaVinci Resolve shortcuts on it, check out the keyboard by Alogic Keyboard. It's great. I've been using it for a while, quite a while actually and does a great job and it's actually helped me learn some new keyboard shortcuts. I've been using them a little bit more than before because some I didn't know, but when they're there on the keys, I'm like, oh, okay, let me just hit that then instead of putting through the menu to find it. So I'll leave a link down in the description below. You can check that out if you're interested. So with that said, are there any keyboard shortcuts I miss that you use all the time? If there is, drop it down below in the comments, share it with the community. Hey, I might even learn something from you guys too, right? I learn from you guys all the time. All right, with that said, I'm out of here. I will see you in the next video. Peace.
