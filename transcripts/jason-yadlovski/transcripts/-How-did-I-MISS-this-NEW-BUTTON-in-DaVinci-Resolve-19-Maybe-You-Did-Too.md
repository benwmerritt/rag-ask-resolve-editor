So I'm working in DaVinci Resolve yesterday and I saw this button. I'm like, what is that button? That's new. I haven't seen that before It's like, what does that do? So I figured you know what? I'm gonna make a video about it show you guys what it is where it is and maybe it's something you haven't seen yet either and it might even Be new in 19 beta 4 because I don't remember seeing it and usually I'm not that slow on picking up on stuff But let's jump in resolve. I'm gonna show you what it is and what it does So I mean resolve and I was working on a little project and I had the inspector open and I looked right Up here and I was like wait a second. What is that little button right there? I don't know what that is and I noticed it says track if I hover on it We have this one that says clip and this one that says track So if I select any piece of you know audio here on an audio track And then I come up here and select the track option It's gonna show me my track level effects that are new here in DaVinci Resolve 19 Now you still have to like kind of click over here right on the track area Which like you didn't know if you were actually selecting the track unless maybe you came over here and selected it that way And when I do that you can see I do get the some of the options right here But if I were to select a particular clip and then come over here to the track option in the inspector Now we've got all of our tools here the ducker the remixer dialogue separator dialogue leveler and the voice Isolation now if you don't have studio you're not gonna see all the options here So this is a little button just allows you to use the track level effects by selecting a clip right and it's gonna apply to your entire Track there now. I thought maybe just maybe it would apply to just your clip for example like this music clip here When I select it Maybe it would apply just to the music clip if I use the track option up here, but it's not the case there It actually does apply it to the entire track so keep that in mind You're not able to use for example the you know music remixer on only one clip in a track It's gonna be a track level effect same with the ducker or you know the dialogue separator into these other ones They're gonna be track level now voice isolation You can use you know on a clip-by-clip basis if you want it So if for example, I have my music clip selected and I'm on the little clip section right here Notice I do have voice isolation I do have dialogue leveler and I do have music remixer So those tools you can use on a clip-by-clip basis But if you want to use the other tools and we come to the track level here So that would be the ducker and the dialogue separator Those you need to use on a track level So just a cool handy way where you can kind of flip back and forth between the clip using this icon right here and the entire Track using this icon you can go back and forth and you'll notice you can apply voice isolation on the entire track or on Just one clip or on both so with these three tools here It looks like you can use them twice right once on a clip once on a track It almost like layers up those effects there So so there's always cool little things like that that we're stumbling on or I'm stumbling on here in DaVinci resolve I try to read through the little you know update list there that they put out But sometimes you know, I don't catch it in this little button. I was like hey, what is that? That's kind of cool What does it do? So that's what that button does there to come in handy for you Just being able to use those track level effects here in DaVinci resolve and I forgot to mention I was in the edit tab I'm always in the edit tab for me. No reason to go into the cut tab there, but actually if you go into Fairlight Let me just check that real quick Fairlight. We've got the same button there, too So you can see there's our our track level and our clip so you can flip back and forth there You select the clip between the track and the clip so you know it works Fairlight works in the edit page and Yeah, just makes it a little bit easier to access those tools and make sure you're getting the right thing that you want to get so That is today's a video guys as I stumble on more new stuff here in 19 keep making videos for you guys because that's how we learn right we stumble on stuff we try things and We're able to just share with each other what you learn what I learned figure this thing out together and with that said guys That wraps up this video. Thank you so much for watching. I'll see you in the next video. Peace Cameras too far away. All right. See ya
