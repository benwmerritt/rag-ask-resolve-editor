## Transcript
Alright guys, what's happening? Welcome to Quick Tip Tuesday. Here's my new friend Gemma. She's been taking up a lot of time lately. So cute. Mini Bernadoodle here. So cute. If you missed the short about it, picked up a new puppy here. Her name's Gemma. She's a mini Bernadoodle. And she's also going to be helping me out down here in the studio a bunch. So we got Quick Tip Tuesday today and we're going to be jumping into Resolve. We have one tip today that actually is this guy right here, middle mouse wheel. It's going to save you a lot of time here in DaVinci Resolve when you're working with the EQ. So let's jump into Resolve, check this out. I'm going to put her down so we can finish this video here. I'll meet you in Resolve. So here we are in DaVinci Resolve. We're in the Fairlight tab right here. Make sure you're in Fairlight. Now we want to open up the EQ so if you don't have your mixer open at the top of the screen here, open up your mixer and then we have EQ right here. If you don't see it right there, click on our favorite three little dots up here. Make sure you've got EQ turned on. So just double click your EQ to open it up. Now the thing we want to talk about is the middle mouse wheel. So when we boost up any point here, you used to have to come to this Q factor right here, which affects the shape of your bell curve if you're using this option right here. So that's going to affect how many frequencies are being affected by my point four in this case. Well, instead of coming down here and doing this with the Q factor, I can just use my middle mouse wheel. Roll up and down here. Look at that. A lot easier. I can boom. There we go. Let's just say I'm here. I want to tighten it up so I can find my exact frequency. And then maybe I got to open it up a little bit. Then I can drop it down. I cut some frequencies. The middle mouse wheel is really going to help speed it up when you're just kind of playing around here in the EQ and trying to figure out which frequencies need a little fixing. That's it guys. That's today's Quick Tip Tuesday. Nice and quick and simple for you. And I got a lot more stuff in the works. It's just, it's, I gotta be honest, take me a little time to get it out here, getting used to pup over here and trying to get down here in the studio to get everything filmed, edited, all that kind of stuff. A little underwater lately, but we're going to figure this out because I love making vids for you guys. So we're going to keep at it. All right. With that said, guys, thanks for tuning in. I look forward to seeing you in the next one. Peace. Oh, thumbs up and subscribe. You learned a little something. I mean, come on. Thumbs up. Come on. Give me thumbs up. A little sub there. A little sub down in the bottom. Come on. All right. Thanks guys. I'll see you in the next one. Peace. Yeah. What did you find your first video there? Huh? Let's say hello. Put your, put your feet up here. You're like, no. I don't want to be on camera, dad. I don't want to be on camera. A little scary, huh? A little bitey. A little bitey. Sorry. No big deal. No big deal. Man, it's hard to get stuff done though with a puppy. I mean, raised a couple of kids. All right, but we're way past that. And I'm going to go back and like do all these things all the time. It's busy. A little bit underwater lately. Gotta be honest. A little underwater. A lot of stuff going on. If you suck around this long, just in case you guys were wondering, had a couple of photo gigs last couple of weekends. A lot of pictures taken there. Had a couple other things to do. Some, some, some vids I'm working on that are taking a bit of time and her right here taking up a lot of time. So we're trying to figure all this out, you know, but don't worry. We'll get the videos coming. By the way, ResolveCon, did you guys see that announcement today, which is Monday, May 16th. I'm filming this ResolveCon with Casey Ferris and a bunch of awesome other DaVinci Resolve creators. Super excited about that. Looking forward to that. All right, we got to go edit this video up because it's got to go out tomorrow. And I got to work on another video that's coming up in the next few days too. So, all right, we'll see you guys later. Peace.
