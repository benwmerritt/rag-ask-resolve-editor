Ah, what is happening guys? Today we're going to be doing something a little fun here. We're going to be mixing some music using the Fairlight console here. This is the last kind of big test I wanted to do with the console here. We're going to jump in and resolve and start mixing a multi-track recording that I did. So if you saw some of our previous videos where we talked about multi-track recording into DaVinci Resolve as well as using the Fairlight panel here, you should be up to speed with kind of where we're at and stuff. If you're not, I'll send a link somewhere. You can go back and check out the series here that we're kind of working through. But I just wanted to use this board, use the Fairlight console to mix. And that's probably the best thing that we can do with the mixer. And the thing that I like to do the most with it is to use the faders and be able to mix and blend. So we're going to go through all of our different instruments and our vocals. We're going to mix it together. I'm going to work with the board a little bit here. We are going to be using a bunch of presets and stuff and plugins on a bunch of the instruments just to kind of speed up the process here. So I don't drag through the video too slow for you guys. But when we get to the vocals, we'll try and work with the EQ and stuff on the Fairlight panel here. And one thing to note, I do have the Fairlight panel set up. I'm going to have DaVinci Resolve over here, which I should probably bring it up now. Put Resolve over here on this screen. And then over on this screen over here, which you can see from my other angle over here, on this screen is connected directly to Fairlight or to the Fairlight console. It's not going to the computer at all. So everything that we see on this screen over here is coming directly from the Fairlight console here. So we can make adjustments. We can look here. We can look in Resolve. It's really pretty, it's pretty good, pretty seamless. There's no delay or anything between your different places where you're looking for stuff. Now if I was doing audio editing on a more permanent basis, a more regular basis where I needed to use all these tools, I'd probably come up with a better setup that made a little more sense, maybe some different size monitors and things like that. For now, for testing this guy out and seeing how it works, I think it's going to work out just fine. So we are going to be mixing using some headphones here. I'm using some Sennheiser HD280 Pros. If you've ever seen the Joe Rogan podcast, these are like what he uses on there, I'm pretty sure. But I would probably most of the time use some monitor speakers, which I have, but because I'm recording here, it would just cause too much feedback. So I'm going to edit it in the headphones here. And we're just going to see what kind of mix we can come up with. So we're going to put these guys on and get to creating some music here. So looking in Resolve, this is our project right here. We already went through and organized everything. We created a few extra buses and grouped some things together, like the keyboards here. So we're just going to start by checking our levels on all of these tracks. And I think just for time's sake and to do it fairly quickly, we're going to just normalize all of these audio tracks. So we're going to just select all of them like this. I'm going to right click. I'm going to come to normalize audio levels. We're going to start here sample peak program. I'm going to do independent. So it looks at each clip independent of the other clips there. And this should at least give us a good place to start. Make sure that nothing's peaking. Nothing's like too far out of whack. So let's go ahead and hit normalize. All right. So all of our tracks should be normalized there. And if you wanted to just spot check it and see if it did anything. Now remember, normalization is just a volume adjustment, right? Like a levels adjustment. You can just click on any track here. I'm going to go to the inspector. And if our volume changed here, that means normalizing did work, right? So if I come up to like my vocals, for example, that dropped it back a little bit and click it on some other tracks, we can see it did change our audio tracks here and normalize them or adjust our volume for us. So I am using just so you guys know the Fairlight console, my keyboard and a mouse to kind of just go back and forth between everything. First thing I want to do is start working with my drums. So I do have some drum set up here. If I zoom in on my tracks by holding the shift key, I can use the shift key on my keyboard or actually the shift key right here on the Fairlight console to zoom in the green tracks here are my drum tracks. And I'm going to look at it here on the Fairlight console as well. I've got my hi hat kick snare toms one toms two and symbols. So what I'm going to do is use some plugins here just kind of speed up the process a little bit. I'm going to be using the CLA plugins from waves because they're they're great. They do a good job and they've got all the different parts and pieces that we're going to need for different instruments and things like that. So I'll link those below. You can go check them out if you're interested. So the first thing we're going to do is just bring down all our faders for everything and we're just going to start with the kick and that's how we're going to start mixing our stuff together. So I'm going to come back to my other tracks here just bring everything down come to our kick and we're just going to play through. Let's zoom in on our click track or kick track here. Here we go. So let's play through a little bit of this and just see what we got. I'm going to make my tracks a little smaller there. There's not a whole lot of real estate on the screen here when you're doing a lot of a lot of tracks and you have a lot of faders and all that kind of stuff. But here we go. Let's just play through and see where we're at. Okay so on our drum track I'm going to go to our effects. We're going to go to drums VST CLA drums stereo. Now in the presets we're just going to use some presets here. We've got different ones here. We've got start me up and a whole bunch of different ones here. If you were using presets like this you decide what works good for you. I'm just going to start with start me up and let's see how that sounds. Maybe we'll try a few different ones here. I think I'm just going to go with the start me up here's a little before and after. Okay good. So that really adds a little bit of more punch to it I think. So I like that we're good on the kick. Next let's move over to the snare. We're going to try that guy out. So I'm going to select my snare track. Find our snare here. We're going to come ahead where the snare actually starts and let's listen in. Alright and again I'm going to go ahead and drums CLA drums. Two kind of snare presets we've got here. Start me up let's start with that because it worked good the last time. Okay I like that that sounded pretty good. We're going to go with that for now. I'm actually going to turn off the reverb because I think I might add a little effect on to the drums as a whole to the drum bus so that they all kind of get the same thing. So we're going to try with that. Alright that sounds good. Next we're going to move on to the toms. So we're going to select our toms track and let's play through and see what we got here. I'm just going to go ahead and actually copy the CLA effect from one track to the next by holding my option on a Mac or alt on a PC. Copy and dragging it over. I'm going to open the effect back up here and let's say we've got toms and I'm just going to go with the start me up preset here and let's listen and see how that sounds. Alright sounds good to me. So we have a toms one and then we also have a toms two here. So again I'm just going to copy our toms over to our other toms to our toms two. Let's hear our toms two here. Alright I'm happy with that. So we've got our hi-hat so I'm going to come on to my hi-hat track. I'm going to solo that and let's see if we have a preset for something like a hi-hat in our drums here. Again I'm just going to copy over the effect and bring it up. Let's see, cowbell, room, toms, overheads. Let's try the overheads here just see what that does. Let's go ahead and listen into our track here. Actually sounds like the cymbals track. Let me solo out our cymbals track too and just see what that sounds like. So I think these two tracks that we have here that are hi-hat and cymbals are actually both the overhead mics. I forget off the top of my head what they were when we recorded but I think they're both overhead mics. So let's just use this overhead preset here to start me up and we're going to use that on both the cymbals tracks there. So I'm just going to copy it over, option or alt, drag and drop that on there. I'm going to take out the reverb so I can add that in separately. I'll close these down. Now let's see if we can mix the drums together to get a nice little mix there and then we can go from there and maybe apply a little bit of an effect there on the drums as a whole. So we're going to come back and let's go ahead and play through. And we're going to mix our drums together here. Start with our kick and snare and then toms and cymbals. Move ahead to where everything's in. Alright, so one thing I think I want to do is come into my cymbals track and that's mostly high frequencies. So I want to throw a low pass or high pass filter on here. Sorry, we'll bring that up a little. Okay. Tom, let's take out the top end. Alright, we're going to take out some of the top ends of some of this stuff that we don't need. Alright, I think that should help a little bit. Let's jump ahead. So I think I want a little more out of my kick so I'm going to come up here and just bring it up a little bit. Just a little bit. Let's make sure we're not peeking. Alright, I think that's alright for drums. We're going to go with that for now. Let's go ahead and move on to our next instrument, which is going to be the bass and the sub-bass. So there's no sub-bass on this song, so we don't have to worry about that. But we do have bass. There we go. Bass A11 here. So let's just go ahead and solo our bass track here. We've got, let's see, bass right here. We've got our track selected. And let's go ahead and drop a preset onto the bass track. We've got bass. I'm going to go bass, VST, CLA bass. And let's just go with a clean preset here. Alright, jump ahead to our bass track. Bring up our bass. Alright, I think that's good for bass. So what we're trying to do now is just make sure everything sounds pretty good. We like the way it sounds. And then we're going to start and build the mix up as we go in and just start with our, you know, our bass and our drums and then build the mix around it. Make sure we got room for vocals. But now we're just going through track by track to make sure that everything sounds good, works good, and I need a sip of coffee. Ah, who doesn't love some coffee, right? Little coffee and audio. Come on, come on, right? Alright, bass is good to go. Next let's take a listen to our keys. So got our keys here. And if you did follow along with the other videos, you'll notice in Resolve here for our keys, they're actually linked together, right? I linked the two tracks together. The function is one because we had a keys right and a keys left. And I'm also going to want to pan those a little bit to make sure they're going where they're supposed to go. So on my keys, left, want to pan it to the left and on my keys right, want to pan it to the right. So let's just play through, listen to a little bit of keys here. Okay. Now the keys sound pretty good. And the reason is because they're an electronic keyboard, everything is pretty much set up. Like it's pretty good to go. So I'm going to leave that where that is. I think we're okay to go with the keys, how they are. Let's move on to electric guitars. Let's go with electric guitar one. We're going to start here now. Electric guitars, again, they're running through their own pedal boards and creating their own effects and sounds and all that. So as far as EQ stuff, there's maybe not too much I'm going to do here. We'll take a listen and see. And maybe we can try applying something on there just to see how it works out. But chances are we probably don't really need to do too much with it. So let's go ahead and solo our electric one. So we got our electric one soloed. Let's go ahead and play through it and see what we've got. Alright, I actually like the way that effect is sounding on there a little bit. So I think I'm going to leave it on. It's up to you. Maybe you want to leave it as it is, but I don't know. I kind of like that. So I'm going to go with that. So let's jump on to electric guitar two here. We're going to solo electric two, select our electric two track. We may apply the same effect. Let's see what we got here for electric two. So this is more the lead part. Let's see if we copy the effect over. Alright, not too bad. I'll go with that. I like the way that that sounded. Next let's move on to our acoustic guitar here. Let's see what we got here for acoustic. We're going to solo out our acoustic. We got it. Oh, the other thing that I want to do is actually I want to pan my electric guitars a little left and a little right just to kind of create some space in the middle of our mix for the vocals, but we'll do that when we get to mixing everything together. So just wanted to mention that real quick. Alright, let's play through a little acoustic. Let's copy over our guitar effect. I may keep the reverb on here. Sounds a lot better with the effect on there. CLA does a great job. Alright, that's cool. I think I'm going to leave the reverb on there for that one. I could use a little bit of the delay. I do like the spreader for the pitch that's going on there. That's kind of nice. And I think that's pretty good. We're going to see how it fits into the mix once we mix it together here, but I'm going to go with that for now. Let's do it. Alright, so next we have our vocals. Actually, we have a saxophone. Can't forget my saxophone friends. I'm a saxophone guy. I play the saxophone, so can't forget our saxophone. So let's go ahead and play through this. I'm going to select up our saxophone. Now I don't know if there's an instrument plug-in for saxophone. Let's see. Do we have any instruments? We've got the Fairlight Foley Sampler. Yeah, now it doesn't look like it, so maybe what we'll do is... Let's see. Do we have a channel? CLA maybe? CLA Mix Hub Stereo? I don't know. Let's give that a try. Throw it on our saxophone here and see what we can do to pull out some of that awesome saxophone. I love me some saxophone. We've been playing for a long time, so gotta give props to my saxophone dudes. Or gals. Or gals. My daughter plays saxophone, so it's cool. Alright, so let's just play through. We're going to try some of these presets and see what we got here. Go saxophone. Should be good. Alright. Alright, I'm not liking the... Let's get rid of that effect, because I'm not digging it. And maybe we'll just do some of our own work here. So let's change this to EQ Dynamics and Effects. I'm actually going to loop this little section here where he keeps playing. Let's actually go with this section right here. We're going to loop. And then we're just going to play this back and we're going to do a little bit of our own EQ and Dynamics work here to see what we can do. Now if you're looking from this angle over here, you can see right here is our track for our saxophone. I've got it selected here. And let's just go ahead and play through it and we're going to start working with some EQ. So we're going to use EQ on the board here. Alright. Let me just jump in here. Alright, I think that's okay for a little saxophone to get started here. So we're going to go back to our channels here. It is a little tricky to use the faders here. I mean, for me, because I'm not used to using the faders on the console here, it is quicker to do it in DaVinci Resolve. Just grab the EQ slider around and do what I need to do. So where this thing really shines is going to be mixing with the faders, right? As far as adjusting your different settings and limiter's, compressors, that kind of stuff, you could do it all here. But honestly, it's probably a little quicker just to do it right in DaVinci Resolve with a mouse for me anyway at this point because I'm not, you know, I don't use this all the time. So I'm a little slow at it. But if you were using this all the time, it could probably be pretty quick for you to take care of some stuff. So alright, let's move on to some vocals here. In and out points. Let's start with vocal two, which I believe is the lead on this song. It's coming right here because it looks like there's a bunch going on there on solo, our track saxophone. We're going to solo our vocal. And let's see what we got here. Okay, so what did I do with the EQ here? We took out the low end because we don't need that. I put a little dip in there below the 1K, you know, maybe the 800 range there, just to take out a little bit of what I thought didn't sound so great if we boosted it up there, added a little bit of clarity there around the 4K and then added a little bit of air and brilliance and presence on the top end there. So I think that's going to be good. Let's check out our dynamics here. Let's go ahead and play through that. And let's take a look at it here on the console here. We're going to go dynamics compressor. And let's see what we got here. The King of Heaven prays for heroes. Now he reigns. We will sing forever. With a thousand hallelujahs, we magnify your name. You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the prayer. Perhaps creation longs to have the words to say. All right, I think that works out pretty good. Let's go with that. And we're going to work with some effects. We're going to send the vocals to an effects bus here in a minute. And then we'll be able to add on some effects that way. So let's go to vocal 2 or vocal 1. We're going to come back to our channels here on the board. Go to vocal 1. Solo that. And let's see what we got. This song is forever yours. A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more. To the Lord, to the Lamb, to the King of Heaven prays. You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the prayer. Okay, that's all right. Now there's some singing going on where she's not actually singing into the microphone, which is why I threw an expander on there to kind of drop that level down a little bit so it doesn't interfere with the mix too much. We'll see how that works out. And we have one more vocal track here. We're going to go to our vocal 4. And let's just hear what we got there. To the Lord, to the Lamb, to the King of Heaven prays. For he rose, now he reigns. All right, I think that'll work. Oh, let's check out our dynamics here. Maybe a little compression on there. Let's see. No, CLA does have a great vocals plug-in too. I just figured we'd just do it manually here on the vocals just to see how it works out. But they do have a great vocal plug-in too. So if you just want to drop in on a plug-in, you want to use the CLA, that works out awesome too. So let's just play and do a little compression here. With the thousand hallelujahs, we magnify your name. You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise. Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours. All right, I think that'll work out all right. Okay, so I think that we nailed kind of all of our different tracks and everything here. We've got our bass, a bass, hi-hat, kick, drums, toms, all that. We've got our track or our pad, which is just like a pad underneath all of the music. Let me just show you what that sounds like. So we've got this and here's what it sounds like. Go to our pad track, bring it up. And then we also have the click for the musicians, which we're not going to include in the mix, but it's there. So now we're going to just bring all of our faders down. Not our drums, we're going to keep our drums. I'm just going to bring down the drum bus, which you can see in resolve here moving up and down. So I have all of the drum channels getting sent over to the bus. We're going to do that. Let's kind of mix these guys together. I do have one for the keys as well. But let's just go ahead and we're going to lower all these guys down. And then we're going to try and put together a little mix here and see what happens. All right, drums we're keeping. We're going to keep the drums down and let's just go ahead and play through and see what happens here. So I'm going to start with the pad and the drums and the bass. Then we're going to add in some guitars and then we're going to add in some saxophone and then we'll do the vocals last. And then we may need to carve out some space for our vocals to live there. So that's what we're going to do. Another cup of coffee and we're going to be on our way. Another sip of coffee, not a cup. It's not a whole new cup. All right, let's go. Music Move on, add in some bass. We have a bass yet? We don't have a bass yet. So we have vocals, which we're going to get there. Music Full bass. Music Here's where we're going to. All right, so here's where we're going to pan the guitars left and right. Right? We want to spread them out a little bit for the electric one, electric two. So that's what I'm going to do next here. Bring up the guitars and then we're going to spread them out. Music Bring down our main bus a little. Music Music Music Music Oh, and when you hit the jog wheel, that's what happens there. So let's, since we've got something decent started here, let's go back to the beginning. And I want to create any effects bus for our vocals. So to do that in resolve here, I'm going to create a new bus. We're going to use it as an effects bus. I'm going to go Fairlight bus format. And then in here, I'm going to go add a bus. We're going to call this vocal effects, make it a stereo bus, say okay. And now for our vocal tracks one, two, and well, it's track three, but it's called vocal four. We want to send these tracks over to that effects bus. So if I open this up a little bit here, there we go, our vocal effects bus. Let's just open up our tracks here. A little bit right here, we have bus send. So we want to send our vocal tracks over to the vocal effects, vocal effects, vocal effects. Now, when I do that, I want to open up the settings for my bus set or my send for the track. And I want this to go over pre fader. So whatever I'm doing with the faders of the vocalists, I don't want the signal going to the effects to be changed by what I do with the faders. So I can set that here by saying pre, and I'm just going to bring this up to zero. I'm not going to pan it, just leave it like that. And this will say, okay, always just send the same signal over to our effects. And I can adjust the effects on its own fader to either put more in or take some out. So that's how I want to set up each of the vocal tracks here. So I'm just going to go into each one, hit the pre, bring this up to zero, and that's it. We should be good to go. Okay, so now we have our three vocal tracks getting sent over to our vocal effects, but our vocal effects isn't going anywhere. So we need to come down to our bus output, and we want to send our vocal effects to the bus one, which is our main output from DaVinci Resolve. So I'm going to go ahead and hit that. So now we should be getting our effects coming out of resolve. So now we need to add an effect onto our effects bus here. So what we're going to do is come to our effects, we're going to add an effect. We're actually going to go with the CLA vocals because it's got reverb and delay built into it. So those are the two things we'll use in it. So we're going to come to vocals, VST and CLA vocals. So now in here, I'm going to just turn off these three, as well as the pitch. I don't want to change that. And I'm just going to work with the reverb and delay here a little bit and see what I like and what I think sounds good. So let's just play through a little bit of it here and we'll have the mix that we already did for the vocals and we'll see how the effect sounds. Oh, it's mine. With a thousand hallelujahs, we magnify your name. Who else would die for our redemption? With a thousand hallelujahs, we magnify your name. And a thousand more. So let's say I like that. I think it's okay. It's not too bad, right? We could use some more tweaking on it. But let's say I want to adjust the overall amount of that effect. Well, I can come into my vocal effects and just adjust the slider here and then that's going to allow me to change the amount of the effects. So let's just play through that again here and adjust the amount. Whose resurrection means our rise. There isn't time enough to sing of all you've done. But I have eternity to try. With a thousand hallelujahs, we magnify your name. You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise. Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours. A thousand hallelujahs. All right. Let's just go with that. Let's put the whole mix together and see kind of how it sounded here. Let's just do it. I'm going to un-solo these tracks. Where's that coming from? All right. So I noticed there's like a hiss in the background. I don't know what that is. Let's see if we can find that by soloing through our tracks. See where that's coming from. Okay. So it's coming from the saxophone track. So let's come in here to our saxophone track. Here we are. We got to knock that out. I'm going to throw a gate on there. Let's see if that helps if we solo our saxophone. But this joy is mine. With a thousand hallelujahs, we magnify your name. You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise. Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours. All right. I think that helps a little bit with the saxophone. Let's see how it sounds when he comes in. Now, the reason that I'm doing this is because there's just a lot of extra hiss in there. And that's just his microphone picking up the ambient noise. Okay. So hopefully we can knock that back. And then when he plays, it comes through all right. So let's un-solo. See what we got here. See how it sounds. A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more. Who else would die for our redemption? Whose resurrection means our rise? There isn't time enough to sing of all you've done. But I have eternity to try. With a thousand hallelujahs, we magnify your name. You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise. Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours. A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more. Praise to the Lord, to the Lamb, to the King of Heaven. Praise to the Lord, to the Lamb, to the King of Heaven. Praise to the Lord, to the Lamb, to the King of Heaven. Praise. Get the guitar back in it. And he knows, and he knows, he will sing forever. With a thousand hallelujahs, we magnify your name. You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise. Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours. Let's try a little bit of this on the main. I don't know. Let's see what happens. The Heaven, praise for heroes. Come back to the beginning. Perhaps relational to have the words to say, but this joy is mine. With a thousand hallelujahs, we magnify your name. You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise. Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours. A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more. I'm going to bring up vocal 2 a little bit here. You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise. Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours. To the Lord, to the Lamb, to the King of Heaven. Praise for heroes. Now he reigns, we will sing forever. Now he reigns, we will sing forever. With a thousand hallelujahs, we magnify your name. You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise. Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours. A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more. I'm going to bring up the final part of the song. I'm going to bring up the final part of the song. I'm going to bring up the final part of the song. I'm going to bring up the final part of the song. I'm going to bring up the final part of the song. I'm going to bring up the final part of the song.
