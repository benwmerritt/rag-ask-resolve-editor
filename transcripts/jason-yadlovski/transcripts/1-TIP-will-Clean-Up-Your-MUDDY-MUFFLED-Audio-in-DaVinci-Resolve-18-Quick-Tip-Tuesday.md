What's going on guys? Have you ever recorded some audio that sounded like this? It's a little bit muddy and you need to clean it up a little bit. Well if I go ahead and apply this one change, it's gonna clean up that audio real quick and real easy for you. And that's what we're talking about in today's Quick Tip Tuesday. One tip that is gonna clean up your muddy audio fast. Let's jump into Resolve and check this out. Hey, what's up again? What's up? All right. Whoa, it's getting Resolve. All right guys, to end DaVinci Resolve here, the one tip that you guys can use to clean up audio that sounds muddy or is not that clear is a high-pass filter. It's really easy to apply a high-pass filter to a clip or into an entire track. Check it out. So let's say I want to apply a high-pass filter to my one particular clip. We're gonna use the EQ to do that. Don't be scared of EQ. It's pretty easy. This is just a pretty straightforward basic tip and you're just gonna use your ears and listen to the clip here. So here's how you do it. If we want to apply on a clip level, you can do it in both the edit page and Fairlight. I'm gonna show you in the edit page right now. So let's say right here, I've got my clip where the audio is a little bit muddier. Listen to this. This one change, it's gonna clean up that audio real quick and real easy for you. So that's what the audio sounding kind of muddy. Now let's say we want to apply this high-pass filter. So select your audio clip, open your inspector, which is right here. We want to go to the audio section and you want to come down to your equalizer and enable that. Now what you're gonna do in order to apply a high-pass filter is just turn on band 1. You don't have to worry about band 2 and 3 and as a matter of fact, you can just go ahead and turn them off. And what you're gonna do is listen to your clip and we're just gonna drag this point number 1 up higher and higher until we don't hear all that muddiness anymore. And this is gonna help just kind of clean up and remove some of those low-end frequencies that make your clip sound muddy. So let's play through this and drag it up and see what we can do here. This one change, it's gonna clean up that audio real quick and real easy for you. And that's what we're talking about. Play it again here. This one change, it's gonna clean up that audio real quick and real easy. So you can hear it kind of takes out some of the low end in there a little bit and this clip isn't as bad as some of the clips I've dealt with but it does benefit from applying a high-pass filter because with our dialogue and our speaking, we don't need all that low-end stuff, right? We want to get rid of that to help clean it up. Now here's another example that might make it a little more obvious. This is from a play I recorded. There's a lot of background noise going on here and I'm gonna apply the low-pass filter on a track level here in Fairlight. I'm gonna jump over into Fairlight right here, musical notes at the bottom. You want to make sure you've got your mixer open right here, mixer, and we want to select our EQ. So we're on Audio Track 3. I'm gonna double click my EQ. It's gonna bring this up. Now in order to apply a high-pass filter here, it's the same thing. We're not going to worry about all the bands except for band number one. And you want to make sure it has this little icon, which means everything below the point that I set, it's gonna cut that out. And what we're gonna do is play through our clip and I'm gonna dial this up and you can hear the difference in getting rid of some of the background noise, the lower end frequencies as well as help cleaning up the the vocal a little bit. So listen to this and I'm gonna start with it way down low and we'll just drag it up until it sounds a little bit clearer. Hello everyone. Welcome to our triple creature feature. All right, so can you hear the difference there? It's subtle, but it's gonna help clean up the audio, take out any of the rumbling and the lower end frequencies that you don't need in your dialogue and your speaking audio. And I've worked with audio clips a lot worse than these right here as far as the low end rumbling and and and you know just the lack of clarity in a clip and applying a high-pass filter like this is really going to help clean up your audio and make it sound a little bit better. Now I would go through and do a little more EQ on all these clips here, but you get the idea. Applying a high-pass filter is one thing that you can do that's going to really help clean up your audio. Get rid of those lower frequencies that you don't need. So that is it. High-pass filter. Use it. Love it. It works great on your clips. With that said guys, that is quick tip Tuesday this week in the books. I look forward to seeing you guys in the next one. Peace! You ever just sit around trying to make your own sound effects? I don't know. Sometimes I do that. I do a lot of random stuff here because I sit by myself most of the time just hanging out by myself. You know, I mean I got you guys here. You guys are here. So that's cool. I mean I enjoy that right? You know testing out a new microphone here. We're going to have a video up about this soon. You know these little microphone things are kind of all the rage here lately, but some are good. Some are not so good. We'll see how this one works out, but stay tuned for that if you're interested in that. All right cool. Well let's quick tip Tuesday in the books guys. We'll see you in the next one.
