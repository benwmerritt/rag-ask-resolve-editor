## Transcript
Hey it's official DaVinci Resolve 19, the full release is finally here. So today we're just going to take a look at Resolve. We're going to go over a whole bunch of features. I've got a ton of them. It may be a long video here, but we're going to cover some of the obvious new updates here in Resolve as well as some of the not so obvious things and little things that you might find along the way where you're like, oh, hey, that's new. I didn't see that. I didn't hear anything about that. So let's just jump right in and resolve and start in the media page and just cruise through resolve, talk about some of the cool new things here in Resolve 19. I'm just going to cover a whole bunch of random updates here. Some you may know about, some you may not know about here in Resolve 19, but there's a whole lot more updates here. I'm not going to go over all of them because we'll be here for like a week, right? But if you think there's something in there that I'm not talking about, there's a good chance it's there and I'm just not covering it here, but I'm going through some stuff you may know, some stuff you may not. So keep that in mind. In the media tab here, one of the cool things that we can do now in Resolve 19 is to update any bins that we may have synced to our project. So for example, if we take a look in the media tab here, I've got draft video and you can see I've got a couple folders in there as well as a couple of videos. Well if I were to add something to that folder on my hard drive, so in this case I'm just going to duplicate a file that's over there. It doesn't automatically appear here in DaVinci Resolve. However, new feature, if I right click on my folder here, I can come down to Resync Media Files and it's going to update our files automatically. That's pretty sweet. I don't know how you use power bins, but when I use them, I just add a lot of stuff in. I keep adding things in there like music or sound effects or things. And then I want that power bin to update automatically. If I could just right click and update, well that's a whole lot quicker than having to drag and drop things in there all the time. So that's a great feature that you can do here in the media tab, updating your bin to match whatever's in your files on your computer. Let's jump into the cut tab now. We've got some updates here in the cut tab. Now one of the things that's kind of cool is that we can now see our markers on our timeline as well as our clips here in the cut tab. So if I was to use my M key as a keyboard shortcut to add a marker, if I don't have the clip selected, you can see it'll add it right here on my timeline, right? And if I scroll far, there you go. You can double click it to edit it. Or if you just press the M key twice, it's going to open it up and then you can just edit the marker right here. Add whatever notes you want. I like to use it for creating YouTube chapters. You can use it however you'd like. Now if you have your clip selected and it's highlighted there, if I move ahead a little bit, select the clip and press M. Now it places a marker on the clip. It's really small down there, hard to see. But if I press it twice, it's going to again bring up our markers window there and we can add a title to our markers or any of the other information you might want. If I scroll ahead, it's really small down here. It's hard to see, but it's there. And it actually shows it on the timeline itself too up here. But you can see on the clip, it's actually on the clip down there as well. And that'll translate over into the edit tab so you can also see it over there. Another new update you might notice is a larger enhanced viewer. Now I don't use the cut tab too often here, but if you do, hopefully you notice that this is a little bit bigger and a little bit easier to view. Another update here is a multi-source viewer right here in the cut tab. So if you came up to the top of the screen, clicked right here, now we've got a multi-source viewer. If we were to click on one of these dates, for example, I can see all these different clips right in my viewer here. And it kind of looks like a multi-cam type thing, but it's not. You could just go through your different clips there, but you can see them all at once. They can be synced up if they're synced up. And it's just a cool way that you can take a look at your footage here in the cut tab. Another cool new feature here in the cut tab is the ability to work with our open effects and fusion effects right here in the cut tab. So if you were to come and open up your settings, right now I've got a lens flare that I put on this particular clip. And if we come into our little tool selection here and you click on this one, down here we've got open effects overlay. So if I go ahead and turn that on, now I can come in here and adjust my overlay effects if I want to right here in the cut tab. You can also then open up your inspector, you know, add some key frames of, you know, the position, for example. We start here, I'm going to go ahead a little bit and I'm going to move it over there. So now it should do it for us here. If we just back it up a little bit, here's what it looks like. Perfect and you can do it with a fusion overlay or an open effects overlay. You can turn it on and off so you can adjust it right there on the screen in the cut tab. Another new feature here in the cut tab is the ability to set default transitions as well as apply transitions to selected clips right here from our transitions library in the cut tab. So we can, for example, come to diamond iris here, I'm going to right click and we can say set as standard transition, which is going to be your default transition by default. The default transition is cross dissolve. But let's say you want to diamond iris right click, set as standard transition. And then if you wanted to apply that to a bunch of clips, all you have to do is come down your timeline, select all the clips that you want to apply it to. And then we could just right click on our standard transition, say apply to selected edit points and clips. Boom. And you can see right down here in our timeline, it applies that transition to all of our clips right here in the cut tab. So that's pretty handy if you want to add transitions to a lot of things at once. Another cool feature here in resolve 19 is that you can see the render cache as it updates similar to how you would in the edit tab. For example, if I selected a clip here and let's just drop an effect on there, let's say we want to go with the noise distortion, I'm going to drop it on there. And actually with the transitions you can see right here, we've got the red line and it turns blue and then disappears as that cache gets created. And just to demonstrate more, maybe if I took this particular clip, I deleted the noise distortion and we changed the most motion estimation and the retime process. We can see now we get that red bar up there that says, hey, this file is going to be cached or these effects or the changes to this video clip are going to be cached. And you can see it happening in real time. It's going to turn blue and then disappear. You know, everything is all cached up. Now if you're not seeing that, make sure you come up to view. I'm sorry, playback timeline resolution, make sure you're on full and then under render cache, make sure you have smart or user selected. And then you should see that line appear on your timeline similar as you would in the edit tab. There are a whole ton of new updates for the replay feature in DaVinci Resolve here. Unfortunately, I don't use the replay feature. I don't have a use for that or the equipment to do all that. Really, really cool though. I would recommend checking out some of Blackmagic stuff on how all that works. It's pretty amazing stuff. I checked it out at NAB this year and it's pretty awesome if you do that kind of work. For me, I don't really do that kind of work, but a whole ton of new features there with all that replay stuff. If that's something that you're interested in. So let's jump into the edit tab now and see some of the cool new things that are over there. Jumping into the edit tab down at the bottom here, edit tab. I'm going to zoom my timeline with shift Z. So I got just a couple samples here in my timeline that we're going to take a look at with some different new features here. Now one of the big things is working with a transcription to be able to edit parts of your video. So if I were to select my clip here and then come up to the transcription icon right here, we can say transcribe. Let DaVinci Resolve do its thing. It's going to listen to it. It's going to transcribe all of the audio for us and then we're going to be able to work with it in a bunch of different ways. So once you have your transcription here, not only will it show you individual speakers, but everything is written out for you and it does a pretty good job from what I've seen. So some of the things that we can do once we've got the transcription here is that we can edit the timeline based on the transcription. So let's say I wanted to get rid of my last sentence here. I can select it and hit delete and it's going to delete that from the timeline. Pretty cool that we can just go through and find a sentence maybe that we don't want and you can get rid of it. I'm going to undo that with CMD or CTRL Z. So when I transcribe the clip, it looks like it just transcribed what was in the timeline right here. However, you click on this little guy and you can see that everything's there and we have time codes for everything, right? Tells us what clip it is and then we've got the time codes for the particular clip based on the time that the clip was filmed. So you can go through and find different time codes for different things if you need to. That might be something that's helpful to you. You can search and replace partial words in the transcription if you want. Another new tool that got added here in the transcription window is the place on top tool in case maybe I wanted to add something else. I want to place it on top. Boom, it'll add it right down here in our timeline on top of your current clip. So that's pretty handy if you need to add something to your timeline. They also added support for transcribing nested clips. So that's something that might come in handy. The ability to import and export SRT and SRTX files from the transcription is a new feature and we've also got the ability to see and label speakers where it'll detect different people that are speaking in a clip. These are just me so you can't see the difference there. Just going to be me. But if you've got multiple speakers, it can separate it out by speaker, which could be really handy if you're working on something like a podcast, an interview or something like that. Moving on from the transcription updates, if we were to be in our timeline, I'd select a clip and if I open up my inspector right here and come to the file section, we can actually see our audio configuration for that clip. Now I've synced up some good audio with this clip already and we can see that right here, right? We've got the original audio as well as synced up good audio. So you can see how many tracks are associated with a given clip. I think you can see up to 32 maybe. You can preview them right here if you want. Left channel for example. There's more effort into this and right channel. But I want to try and put some more effort in both channels and you can change the format if you need to. But being able to see this right here in the inspector comes in really handy when you've got multiple tracks associated with a given clip. Another new update here in the edit tab is the support for fixed playhead scrolling in your timeline. So if we come to our timeline view options here and we choose fixed playhead, that's going to lock the playhead in place for us kind of like it does in the cut tab. So if you're coming over from the cut tab and you used to seeing it this way, you can totally keep it this way if you want where the timeline will go past the playhead. The playhead doesn't move. You can do that and that'll work out just fine if that's something that you like to do. So that's the feature here in Resolve 19. Speaking of the way things look in the timeline, if we also come back to our timeline view options here, we do have a new way we can change the viewer background. We can do black, gray or checkerboard. Checkerboard's the new one here. So if I was to take this clip and just scale it down a little bit, let's go like this, scale it down. We now see a checkerboard background and you've got the ability to change the way that looks. You want a black background, a white or a checkerboard. So you can use whatever you want right there, just something that might help make it a little bit easier if you're putting multiple things on the screen at once. Another great update here is if we select a clip, open up our inspector, come down to our read time and scaling options down here, open that up. And under motion, it's estimation. We always had speed warp, which really kind of bogged down your machine a lot. At least for me, it would slow things down to a crawl, so I would only apply it right before I'm about to render it out. But now we have a speed warp faster option, which should work a little bit better for you, than the speed warp better, which is obviously going to bog things down a little bit more. So if you're trying to use the speed warp, get a little bit better results with your motion estimation. Maybe you did some slow-mo, but you didn't have enough frames. You want to use a little speed warp. This is going to make a big difference for you. So faster should allow you to be able to see it and be able to watch it. And then maybe you want to change it to better before you actually render out your project. But the faster option here is new in Resolve 19. Now some of the audio updates that you'll notice right here in the edit page are the track level effects. So if we come into a clip that's got some audio, I'm going to, let's just delete this effect off there. I'm going to come into the audio section, and we've got our track level effects right here. If I select my audio track, we can see our different track level effects. Now if you only have the clip selected, you'll only see a few of the effects. The music remixer is a studio only as well as voice isolation is studio only. Dialog leveler should be there in the free version for you. But if you only see a few of them and you have studio, make sure you have the track selected down here. So improvements to voice isolation, it now runs smoother, runs better, it doesn't take any time to kick in. It's just going to do a faster job of using and applying that voice isolation. So improvements were made under the hood to voice isolation. The Dialog leveler, which is in the free version, also has some improvements. It's got changes under the hood, nothing that you're going to notice on the surface level here even if you open up the effect. It's just going to react quicker. It's going to work faster and work a little bit better for you if you're applying it onto your clips. There should be no delays anymore that you used to see with the voice isolation or the Dialog leveler. They should just start right away and you shouldn't have any issues with them because they got a little update under the hood. Little tune up, tighten up some bolts, clean out that carburetor or something and they're going to work a little bit better for you now. Other effects that I have made videos about already, the Dialog separator is going to allow you to separate out things like background noise and ambience from your dialogue or your voice. So those are great, it's a great tool. You can get in there and use it. It's a studio version only tool. Another tool we've got is the Music Remixer and that's going to allow you to change the mix of a song. You can add in more drums, more bass, take some out, leave in the vocals, take the vocals out. You can mute different instruments and stuff that you see here. Really cool tool. I do have a video about that. You can check out that video if you want more information. The ducker here is a great new feature here in Resolve 19. I've got a video on it but if you haven't checked it out yet, here's how it works. You would turn it on on your track, make sure your track is selected. It's going to duck the volume of something like music below your dialogue. So what you can do is tell track number two here, which is my music track, to use track number one, which is my dialogue, as the source so we can drop down or lower the volume of our music underneath my dialogue. And you can go all the way up to 18 dB here. So let's hear that in action. But I want to try and put some more effort into this and I've got tons of questions to answer and comments on my YouTube videos here. So, I figured you know what, let's hit record there, let's get another DaVinci Resolve. And then when you're done talking, it's going to go back up to its normal volume. Now under the advanced settings, you can have it look ahead a little bit. You can change how quickly the music goes back to its regular volume, how long it holds it, as well as the recovery. You can adjust all those to your liking. But here's what it sounds like when it goes back to its normal volume. News this last week. Makes it real quick and easy. Now this works best if you only have one dialogue track, for example. If you've got multiple dialogue tracks, this is not the way to do it. You can't select a bus. If you sent multiple dialogue tracks to one bus, you can't use the bus as the source for the ducker here. What you would have to do is use the new sidechain feature that we'll talk about in a few minutes. So those are the couple of the audio features that are updated here in the edit tab, as well as over in Fairlight. It's going to be the same there. We'll talk more about some audio features in a second here. But sticking in the edit tab, check this out. If we come to a clip here and I open up my effects library and I apply a video transition on here, let's say triangle iris. I put it in between these two clips. I zoom in a little bit. And now let's say, well, let's get rid of this one here. I'm going to delete that one. Let's say I delete this clip. Now that transition, instead of getting deleted, then you got to drop it on again. If we were to delete this, ripple delete it, that transition stays there. That's huge. How many times have you put on a transition thing to decide, I got to cut this clip on either side a little bit. I'm going to cut this back to here. I make the cut and the transition disappears and it drives you nuts because you have to drop on the transition again. This is going to eliminate the need to have to do that. So that's a really great feature here in 19. I like that a lot. Now while we're talking about transitions, let's talk about some new ones that they added in. We didn't even hear about these, but boom, here they are in the transitions effects library here. So if we scroll down, let's take a look at some of the new ones. We've got box twist. Check this out. I'm going to drop that on there. Little box twist. That's a little quick. So let's drag that out, make it a little longer here. Little box twist. You can see what's happening with that. Pretty cool. Another new one we have is box wipe. Here's what that looks like. It's over and again, all these are going to have options in the inspector that you can change and adjust. We've got a checker wipe and here's what that looks like. We have disarrange. I like that one. That one's kind of cool. Something a little bit different. We've got elastic rubber. Here's what that looks like. Kind of bounces the frame in there and again, you can adjust all of these if you need to. We have this one, page curl. A lot of people have asked for this or how to do it over the last few years and there were some plug-ins from third parties that would do it. But the page curl, we just drop it on there. I'll stretch it out a little bit and it's going to automatically do a page curl transition for us. Check this out. Let's scale up the eyeball here so you can see it a little bit easier. Here we go. Page curl transition. And it's literally the page curling as it's turning. A lot of people have asked for that over the last few years that I've seen. We've got a pop wobble and here's what that looks like. A little pop and wobble there. We have the V-wipe. Drop that on there and it's going to do a little V-wipe for us from one clip to the next. Now bad end, as I mentioned, just select your clip. Go up to the inspector, transitions. You can change the color. You can do whatever you want and modify it however you want. Change the blur size, the blur width. You just put your cursor over the clip and you can just change this to your heart's desire and make any kind of adjustments that you want. To really customize them, then you can always save it as a preset. If you just come to it in the timeline, click create transition preset. You can save your own preset. It's customized, but you didn't have to do all the work to invent it from scratch. So that's a great little tip right there. And while we're still in the edit tab here, there's a ton of other stuff that got added that I didn't even hear mentioned anywhere. For example, in our effects library, titles. Scroll down. We have a whole bunch of new titles now. We have titles like the cosmic title or I'm sorry, comic title. Helps if I could read. We have an elegant shadow title, a headline title here, and all these are customizable, of course. We've got a long shadow title. We have a neon flicker. We've got a repeat offset. I've seen all these before made by other companies in third parties and stuff. We have a retro chrome. We've got a ribbon. We have a superhero one right here. We have a zoom text fly through. There's just a whole bunch of them in there and you can customize them, make them however you want. But it makes your job easier. You've got new text things that you can use there that make it so you don't have to go through and create everything from scratch. So those are all really cool. But wait, there's more. So if you come down to generators, look at all these things we've gotten the generators in. Now we have comic speed lines and I've played with this one a little bit. It's all adjustable. If I drop it in the timeline here, you can see I could play through it. But if I select it, now I can adjust the way the lines work, the texture, the line separation, the color. I mean, it's just, it's so cool, man. You could do so much with these presets that they've dumped in there now. We have a vintage texture in here, which is awesome. We've got logos like Stinger Transitions. We've got text rotating with, look at that, it's even got the light rays in there already. We've got Zoom text. We've got different kinds of band wipes and blobs. I saw Alex using these in his video. Broadcast samples, circles, all kinds of different shading and different graphic things, things for text, little stingers or transitions you might be able to use between things. If I drop it in there, you can come in here and you can edit and adjust these different things. To customize it, you can use a custom logo if you want. You can use the text. You can add motion blur, turn that on if you wanted to. But there's a whole bunch of them here. They're all pretty good. I mean, I can't wait to start using some of them just to try them out in my videos. You may even see some of them in here, but a lot of good stuff in there that they added in the generators. But wait, there's even more. So if we jump into the effects, there's more effects. We've got the comic book effect right here, which I had used already. You may have seen it. Let me scroll back here. We'll jump on top of some of these other clips. The comic book effect there, and you can adjust all of these. We've got the flying flag. This one is pretty cool. So if I had an image of the US flag, boom, I could just put it there and it's going to look like it's flying. You can adjust it, modify it and make it look however you want. That's really cool. You've got repeat. That's a new one. Stretch region, I think that's a new one. Noise distortion, I think that's new. I think paper edge is new. I think a bunch of these are new, but I've been using the beta version of 19 so long. I kind of forget what was only in 18.6. So if I misspeak, I apologize. I apologize. You guys can feel free to correct me down in the comments below. Now let's talk a little open effects. We've got some new things here. The biggest one being probably that I'm sure that you've heard of it is the film look creator. This is great. This is a really cool tool. You can just drop it on any clip that you want, and then you can create your own custom looks. You can set it however you want, or instead of dropping it on a clip, what I'd like to do even better is to grab an adjustment layer to become my effects adjustment clip, come back to my film creator look, drop it on the adjustment layer, and now I can stretch that out as long as I want. Select my adjustment layer, and any clip that that is on top of, you're going to get the effect of that. You can change it to any of the presets that you might want. Create your own really, really cool new addition here in Resolve 19. Another few updates to some of the effects here is better face refinement box and profile handling in smooth skin options. The defocus isolates foreground with background blur. Let's just take a look at these real quick in the color tab. Jump into the color tab, open up my effects here. I scroll down. We'll see the face refinement right here. If I drop it onto my clip, we can find our face in the frame, and then some of these tools are going to work a little bit better, have better options for us here for skin smoothing and skin grading and things like that. Deleting that, the defocus background is right here. We can drag and drop that on our clip. We can adjust the mask. We can preview it. So let's say I used a little magic mask to select myself here. We can preview our mask and see where that is. We can apply some blur to it. Blur the edges a little, and then we can adjust the background there. Of course, obviously you'd want to create a better mask, but you get the idea here. You can separate your background and foreground really easily if you're using a camera that maybe doesn't have the best depth of field, but you want to simulate that. Does a really good job. I've seen some great examples of this particular tool at work. So that's one you want to get in there and try it out for sure. There's more updates to the radial blur right here, as well as the zoom blur down here. They've been improved so that the quality is better, the blur looks better. So if you use those two, hopefully you see an improvement there. And if you use the beauty filter here, there has been some enhancements to allowing that to work faster and better and just more efficiently here in Resolve. So if you use that often, hopefully you see a good result and a good improvement when you're using that tool. And just back jumping back to the edit tab real quick, another feature that was added here in the edit tab is the ability to make sure you've got safe zones for your footage. So if you came up and you clicked on this little drop down here, you can see it's got different settings here that you can choose to make sure that your clips are within the allowable boundaries and things for various forms of social media, broadcast the film, and safe area guides right here. So let's say you want to do action. There you go. So you can choose that and it gives you a guide as far as where your stuff needs to be. Now let's jump into Fairlight, one of my favorite pages. Jump in here, talk about just a little bit of audio. We already talked about the new track level effects. Now you can see your track level effects in your mixer as well. So if you open your mixer, you should see them here, but you only see two. So if you were to click on your three dots, you can come down to visible track effects and just turn all of these on. You have to do it one at a time here. I'm not sure why that is. You turn them all on, boom. And now you can see all of your track level effects right here in your mixer in Fairlight. So another cool feature that got added here in Fairlight is intelligent panning, right? So if you had a jet flying across the screen or something like that, you can have resolve automatically pan your audio to match that jet flying across the screen or maybe it's somebody running across the screen. So if you were to come to the viewer and you click on this right here, you can say show tracker controls and then you can click on auto. It'll do it for you. You can also show the tracker coordinates and that's going to do some automatic AI work for you in the background so that you don't have to go in and do it all manually with keyframes and things like that. Pretty good feature. It works out pretty good. When it comes to our EQ, we now have a frequency analyzer. This is something everybody's wanted for a long time here. Let's go ahead. I'm just going to mute my audio here, but I'm going to open up the EQ here. And as I play through the audio here, you can see now we have a frequency analyzer, which is really helpful so you can see what audio signals or audio frequencies, I should say, are getting through and which are not. For example, if I turned on a high pass filter here, rolled it up. Now you can see that the darker blue here is what's passing through and then we can still see the original signal there, but it's kind of grayed out a little bit, right? So that comes in real handy. You're trying to find a problem areas, right? You're boosting it up and you're like, oh, maybe there's a problem and I dropped that down a little. And we could be sure that we're actually getting the frequency we want. You can see how the track is or the clip is responding to the changes that we make, but really handy and it comes in really handy. The other thing you could do is boost your gain here. And in the past, when you boosted this up, it would take the whole EQ line and push it up, which I don't know. I don't know why I did that. But now I think this makes more sense is that if you wanted to boost the gain, you could just boost it right here a little bit and the EQ line doesn't move, which is kind of nice. Double click, you can always reset that. There's also some EQ presets in there that have got added. So you can try those out too if you're interested in that. Now not only can we see a frequency analyzer there, but if we were to come and add an effect onto our clip, we have a frequency analyzer right here. And in the frequency analyzer, we can change it to full spectrum. We can look at the low frequencies, the high, mid, but we can also see it as a waterfall, so depending on how you want to look at your audio level, see what's happening. You've got different ways to look at it and just options, right? We like options and being able to work with our audio in different ways. Here's another way that you can see your audio in different ways. And I said ways a lot there. So yeah, that's a lot of ways for the audio. This next one is pretty cool. It got added in here. It's called exclusive solo. So currently if I had multiple tracks, I can solo multiple tracks. That's all only hear those tracks while I have them soloed. I won't hear a whole bunch of other stuff. But if I only wanted to be able to click the solo button and then say I wanted to hear track one and only solo that, I don't want to have to unclick this one. So what we can do is come up to the Fairlight menu, come down to exclusive solo, turn that on. And now when I click on the solo button for any track, it's only going to have one track soloed at a time. So if you're going through a bunch of tracks and you only want to solo one track, this is how you can do it. And then if you're done soloing one track at a time, you can come back up to Fairlight and turn off exclusive solo. So that's really handy when you're just trying to hear one track at a time, you're going through a lot of tracks, you don't want to click and unclick solo, use exclusive solo. We now have the ability to loop our audio a whole lot easier here in Fairlight as well as in the edit tab. It works to loop your video as well. So all you want to do is set some in and out points that using whatever method you'd like, put your playhead in between the two, make sure you've got this icon turned on, it's in the edit tab as well as in here in Fairlight. And then when you play through your clip, it'll get to the end or the out point and it'll go right back and just keep looping that over and over again so you can edit your audio, your video, whatever it might be without having to stop, move the playhead, start again, move the playhead and all that business because that takes time. And we want some better features like this loopback. So it's a whole lot easier to do now. Another big one is a change to the side chain features. I've got a whole video on this, but if we were to open up our dynamics panel now to work with our side chain, it looks a little bit different than it used to. So this is where it would come in handy if you want to duck your music below multiple dialogue tracks, you would turn on your side chain on your music track. Let's actually select our music track here, turn on your side chain. And if you had a bus that had multiple audio tracks in it, kind of like how I showed in some of my presentations at ResolveCon, if you check those out, if you didn't see them, you got to get in there and check that out. ResolveCon 2024 was awesome. But if you have a bus with multiple dialogue tracks going to it, you can use the bus as the source for your music to duck below. And that's going to allow you to duck below all of your audio instead of just one track at a time like I showed earlier with the ducker. So that's really handy. And another cool thing about the new side chain feature is that we can use effects and tie third party effects to the side chain and have things react like that. So an effect will only become active when the side chain kicks on. And just to show you what one of those tools might look like, if I were to add a third party plugin here, EQ, it's a waves plugin, it's called the FX, or F6 stereo. If it's an EQ plugin, a dynamic EQ plugin, you would see up here side chain. We can have this react to the side chain so I can turn it on. And then I can tell it what do I want it to listen to. In this case, audio one is the only track I have. But if I've got a bus with multiple dialogue or maybe your bass guitars reacting to your kick drum or something like that, you can side chain more the way that you would in the music world. Right? So I've got a little wonky here in Fairlight when it came to side chaining effects. It didn't work quite the way it does in the music world. But now you've got a lot more options with side chaining here. And if you just want to stick with the simple method, go ahead and use the ducker and that's going to do the job for you. If you've only got one track you want to respond to. So side chaining got a big update here in Resolve 19. And I got a whole video on it if you're interested in checking that out. Another update here that kind of helps speed up your workflow a little bit is if you do voiceovers in your record directly into Resolve, you should only have to click the R and it should automatically arm for you. And that's not going to work for me because I'm recording and I've got different things going on while I'm recording here. So I'm using my microphone. It's not going to see it and just hook it up. But it should automatically patch it for you if your microphone is selected as the input for your computer. I haven't tried it too much yet because I'm generally recording when I'm trying it. But give that a try. You shouldn't have to patch everything up. It should kind of do it for you. So give that a try if you do a lot of voiceover work. Should help speed up your workflow there. Now just a bunch of other improvements here. I'm just going to list through real quick. We've got multiple improvements for native effects processing when it comes to your audio, automation improvements, panning in groups, support for head and tail snapping in focus mode, improved response time for EQ changes, the solo mode we talk about fades for different Dolby Atmos compositions, lot of good audio updates here in Resolve 19. Some I've already got videos out about them. So you want to go check those out. Even though they're on the beta version, nothing's really changed from how you work with them and how you use them to the full release here. But definitely check those out if you're interested in more depth knowledge about some of the audio tools. There have also been a bunch of improvements in the color tab as well as the Fairlight tab. I feel like some of my Resolve creator friends are more qualified to explain those to you guys. So I would check out people like Casey, Darren, Alex, Frenchy, Darya, look at all their stuff and get a little more information about that. Patrick and pretty much everybody that was at ResolveCon. You should check out all of their stuff because they know the color infusion way more in depth than I do. And they're going to be able to help you out a lot with all the updates there. But there's been a lot of good updates there. A lot of things that I think you guys would find helpful going to speed up your workflow that are just going to do a good job making your life a little easier here in DaVinci Resolve. You also have a bunch of codec updates here for Windows, a whole bunch of support for different kinds of files and things like that. Just looking at the release here. You have a lot of other improvements to the Blackmagic Cloud and studio licenses, support for other languages, restoring timeline backups and deleting timelines, loading large timelines now shows a progress bar. If you're loading up big timelines, a lot of other good things in here that I'm just not going to run through all of them because there's just so much there. But if you guys haven't updated to Resolve 19 yet, what do you want to do? How should you go about it? Well, one, you back up your database, right? And any other things that you may have created or presets or things like that, back that stuff up if you can. In general, anytime I've applied an update here in Resolve, I've never had a problem with things getting erased or thrown out of whack. And I've been using Resolve since 15, I think? 15, 14, 15, something like that. You don't have to uninstall your current version of Resolve. Just go ahead, download the new one and install it. It'll automatically replace the current version and then keep, for me at least, it always keeps all of those extra things, the presets and all that that I have. It doesn't get rid of those. Those are always there in all the updates. So back up the database though, that's really important. That'll capture all of your projects, your media, that's on you to back up. You keep that separate anyway. But Resolve 19, I've been using it since the first beta version came out on a Mac here, super stable right from the beginning. I've had no issues with it. I've edited lots of projects on it. And with 19, the full release being out here for those of you who aren't in the middle of a project, think about upgrading because there is just so much good stuff in here, improvements, just so much that Blackmagic puts into all of these updates. They just do a really good job. They listen to you guys. I know some of you still want more tools and more features. Keep letting us know. I mean, comment it on my channel, comment it on the Blackmagic forums, on the other Resolve YouTubers channels because Blackmagic Design looks at that stuff. They keep an eye. They got to beat them. What's going on? What people want? And over time, they just keep adding in these features. So if you want something, keep mentioning it. Bring it up. Don't get mad if you don't see it just yet. They're constantly innovating and making things better and newer here in Resolve and making our lives a little bit easier. So that is just kind of a summary here, really, of all the features in 19. Let me know. Did you download it? Have you tried it out? What's your favorite feature? What do you want to see more in-depth of? I'm happy to make more in-depth tutorials about any one of the new features. I want to hear what you guys have to say, what you want to see. And I hope this video was helpful. Just kind of wrapping up some of the cool updates here for you guys. But yeah, if you've got a question's comments, perhaps concern, definitely leave the comment down below. So with that said, thank you so much for tuning in. I'm going to play with Resolve 19 a little more because it's fun. And I will see you in the next video. Peace.
