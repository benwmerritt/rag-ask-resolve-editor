# Blackmagic Server vs. Dedicated Server

The first option you need to choose for your organization is whether to use a Blackmagic or Dedicated

server to host your project libraries and media. The Blackmagic servers are administered by

Blackmagic Design and, like most cloud services, are shared by multiple users and accounts at the

same time. That does not mean that you can read or access other user’s files, only that they are stored

on the same machine. If for security, performance, or insurance reasons your Organization wishes

to have its own dedicated server that is not shared with anyone else, you can select Buy Dedicated

Server instead.

The Buy Blackmagic and Dedicated Project Server interface

To purchase project libraries, click on the Buy Libraries button, and simply enter the number

or dedicated plan you wish to use, then press Add to Cart. Then click on the cart to finish the

purchase details.

To remove a project library, click on the Remove Libraries button. Then adjust the count lower to

remove unused project libraries from your plan. Please note, you cannot reduce your project libraries

below the amount that are currently active or in use; if you do, the message “Cannot reduce project

libraries below amount currently active. Please disable or delete currently active project libraries and

try again” will appear.

TIP: If you have reached your Project Library limit, consider “disabling” a Cloud Project

Library in the Project Server section, rather than deleting it. Disabled Cloud Project Libraries

do not count towards your Project Library Limit, are not deleted, and can always be “enabled”

again when needed. You should consider the Project Library Limit as how many “active”

libraries you need at the moment, not the total amount created.

Licenses

basis. From this tab they can purchase, return, and manage those licenses as necessary. By default,

NOTE: Blackmagic Cloud Storage will never delete your media; only you have the authority

to do that. If you try to reduce your storage under the amount you currently are using, it will

automatically cancel the downgrade. You will have to manually remove enough media to fit

within the new reduced storage amount and try the downgrade again.

What Happens to My Media if I Don’t Pay?

Blackmagic Cloud Storage will never delete your media. If you don’t pay the monthly fee and

abandon the account, after 15 days past due and three emails, your account will be disabled,

not deleted. You no longer will have access to that media but can reactivate your account by

calling customer service to enable it.

Presentations

The Presentations tab lets you see how many presentations you are using, and buy more, or reduce

the amount of presentations that your Organization has. The currently used presentations are shown in

the layout, including their status and number of clips in them.
