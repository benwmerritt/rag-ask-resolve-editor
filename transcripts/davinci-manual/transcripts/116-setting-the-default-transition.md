# Setting the Default Transition

By default, the default transition is a simple cross dissolve. If you wish to change that transition to

another one, simply right-click on a transition thumbnail and select Set as Standard Transition from the

contextual menu.

You not only change the Default Transition type but also its duration and alignment from either

the Timeline Options menu, or by right-clicking on the transition in the Timeline and selecting

“Set Default Transition.”

Titles

There’s a collection of title clips in the Titles Browser that you can use to add superimposed titles,

slates, interstitial titles, lower thirds, or otherwise fulfill any textual needs your program has.

Titles Thumbnails

To audition titles before you place them into the Timeline, ensure that “Hover Scrub Preview” is

checked in the Titles option menu, then simply hover your pointer over any thumbnail in the Titles

tab. If the title is animated (i.e., Fusion titles), moving the pointer across the thumbnail will preview the

animation. Once you’ve chosen your title, you can drag it from the Titles tab to your Timeline in the

Edit page or in the Cut page to either the upper or lower Timelines, or use the editing selection modes

at the bottom of the tab.

Scrubbing over a Title Thumbnail previews the title in the Viewer.

Two categories present two different kinds of titles. The “Titles” category presents simple, bare-bones

titles that you can customize in a variety of different ways. Of the available options, the Text title is

the most flexible. The “Fusion Titles” category presents more complicated titles that are more visually

sophisticated and have more preset animation.

Adding Titles

You can add a title to the Timeline by opening the Titles Browser and dragging and dropping titles

into the Timeline wherever you want them to be, just like any other clip. The default duration of a title

clip is 5 seconds. This standard “generator” duration can be customized in the Editing panel of the

User Preferences.

Once edited into the Timeline, titles can be moved, resized, and superimposed much like any other

clip. Furthermore, when selected, both titles and generators expose the same Transform, Cropping,

Speed, and Composite controls as any other clip; these controls can be used to composite titles in

various ways to create different text effects.

Editing Titles

Once you add a title to the Timeline, the original title generators that shipped with DaVinci Resolve

have onscreen controls that let you edit text and transform and position blocks of text directly within

the Timeline Viewer.

Positioning and Transforming Text

So long as the Timeline playhead is positioned over a text generator that’s on top of one or more

background clips, clicking on the text in the Timeline Viewer reveals onscreen transform controls that

correspond to the Position, Zoom, and Rotation parameters in the Inspector.

Transforming a title’s text box in the Viewer

While dragging text to reposition it, snapping occurs at the X and Y center of the frame, as well as

around the outer third of the frame. Holding the Shift key down while dragging a text object constrains

movement to just the X or Y axes. Holding the Option key down turns snapping off.

Editing Text

Double-clicking on text in the Timeline Viewer puts that text into an editable state, wherein you can

insert a text cursor or select characters to edit the text as you would in any text editor.

Editing Titles Using the Video Inspector

For more precise control of your titles, double-clicking on any title will bring up its parameters in

the Video Inspector. Here you can change fonts, colors, drop shadows, backgrounds, etc. You can

also adjust basic transform parameters and cropping as well.

For more information on Editing Titles, see Chapter 49, “Titles, Generators, and Stills.”

Adding Resolve FX and Other Plugins

The Effects Browser reveals video and audio plugins that you can drag and drop onto to your clips. As

far as video plugins go, there are several categories of Resolve FX plugins that accompany DaVinci

Resolve, but if you’ve installed Resolve-compatible OFX plugins, those appear here as well, organized

into their own categories. For audio plugins, a set of Fairlight FX plugins comes with DaVinci Resolve,

but if you’ve installed VST plugins on macOS or Windows, or you have Audio Units installed on

macOS, those will appear in the Audio category also. When you have a lot of video or audio plugins, a

search field makes it easy to find the one you’re looking for.

Video Effects

Each available category of video plugins creates different sorts of image effects, such as blurs, lighting

effects, or stylization of different kinds. To preview a video effect before placing it on a clip, ensure

that “Hover Scrub Preview” is checked in the Effects option menu, then simply hover your pointer over

any thumbnail in the Effects tab and move it across the thumbnail. The effect will preview in the Viewer

using its default parameters, and scrub through the clip that is selected in the Timeline. If no clip is

selected then it will use the clip currently under the playhead.

To activate a specific video effect on a clip, simply drag the thumbnail of the selected effect to a clip

on the Timeline. In the Cut page, you can also double-click the thumbnail to apply the effect to the

selected clip. To adjust the effect’s parameters, open the Effects tab in the Inspector.

Scrubbing over an Effect Thumbnail previews that effect in the Viewer.

Audio Effects

Audio plugins let you process your audio in different ways, adjusting the tone using equalization,

changing dynamics with compression, or adding effects such as echo, reverb, flange, or modulation.

To activate a specific audio effect on a clip, simply drag the thumbnail of the selected effect to a clip

on the upper or lower Timelines in the Cut page, or onto a clip in an audio track on the Edit page.

Once the effect has been dropped on a clip, its audio plugin controls will open for you to adjust the

plugin’s parameters.

Generators

The various video generators included in DaVinci Resolve can be previewed by hovering your pointer

over any thumbnail in the Generators tab. To edit a generator into your Timeline, simply grab the

thumbnail of the generator you wish to use, and place it in your Timeline in the Edit page, or in either

the upper or lower Timelines in the Cut page.

For more information on using all the included video and audio effects in DaVinci Resolve,

see Chapter 47, “Editing, Adding, and Copying Effects and Filters.”

Interactive Resolve FX and Fusion Effect Overlays in the Viewer

If you’ve applied a Resolve or Fusion effect that uses on screen controls, you can use these controls

in the Cut Page viewer. To do so, open the Tools panel in the Cut page, and select the Effects Overlay

icon at the far right.

You have two options below to either manipulate the Open FX or Fusion Overlays; choose the

appropriate version for your effect. The on screen controls will then appear in the Viewer.

Clicking on the Effects Overlay icon (circled) will activate the on screen controls

of Resolve or Fusion effects in the Cut Screen viewer.

Clip Tools

Clicking the Tools button in the Viewer toolbar opens up additional categories of controls that let you

apply various effects to the current clip, or adjust whatever effect is already applied to the current

clip. Many of the parameters of these effects have corresponding onscreen controls that let you make

visual adjustments directly in the Viewer.
