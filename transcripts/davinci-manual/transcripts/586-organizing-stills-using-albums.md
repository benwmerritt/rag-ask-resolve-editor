# Organizing Stills Using Albums

All stills you save are always placed into the currently open album of the Gallery, which defaults for

new projects to “Stills 1.” However, you can create additional albums with which to organize your stills

into whatever categories you require. Albums can be shown, created, and removed using the Gallery

in either the Color page or Gallery windows.

Use albums to organize your stills

To show or hide the Albums list:

Click the Album button, at the top left of the Gallery.

If the Albums list was hidden, clicking the Album button will make the Albums list appear, to the left of

the Gallery, containing all albums that are currently available in the project that’s open, as well as the

PowerGrade album at the bottom. If the Albums list is already visible, then it becomes hidden, making

more room for still thumbnails in the Gallery.

Once you’ve displayed the Albums list, there are a variety of ways you can quickly and easily work

with albums.

Methods of working with albums:

�To add a new album: Right-click the Albums list, and choose Add Still Album from the contextual

menu. A new album is created, numbered incrementally.

�To add a new PowerGrade album: Right-click the Albums list, and choose Add PowerGrade

Album from the contextual menu. A new album is created, numbered incrementally.

�To rename an album: Double-click any album in the list, and when it is selected, type a new name

and press Return.

�To navigate albums: Click any album to make it the current album. Using the DaVinci Resolve

Advanced control panel, you can use the PREV PAGE/NEXT PAGE buttons to move up and

down the Album list.

�To move clips from one album to another: Drag and drop a still from the Gallery to an album.

�To remove an album: Right-click any album, choose Remove Current Album, and click Delete at

the prompt. All clips inside that album will be deleted along with the album, so use this carefully.

PowerGrade Albums

PowerGrade albums are meant to be repositories for grades you want to reuse frequently, or for stills

that you need to reference from multiple projects, such as when grading a series that shares common

looks from episode to episode.

PowerGrades are associated with your user login

Unlike stills saved to the other albums in the list, which are ordinarily available only to the project

in which they were saved, stills saved to a PowerGrade album are shared among all projects

that have been stored within a particular project library. Each project library has its own unique

PowerGrade album.

Creating a new project library creates a new PowerGrade album, which starts out as a clean slate.

However, you can always use the Gallery window to copy PowerGrade stills from other projects and

project libraries to the current one, and you can create as many PowerGrade albums as you need to

organize your grades.

For more information about project management and project libraries, see Chapter 3,

“Managing Projects and Project Libraries.”

Functionally, PowerGrade albums are identical to any other album, and you can save, organize, and

use stills in PowerGrade albums as you would with other albums. Since PowerGrade albums are

special in that they’re maintained by DaVinci Resolve, the last PowerGrade album cannot be deleted.

Browse all Grades

from the Current Timeline

The Gallery has a Timelines album, available at the bottom of the Album list, that lets you browse all

the grades in the current timeline, or in other timelines of the current project (using a drop-down menu

that appears at the top of the Gallery browser area), making it easy to copy grades from earlier or later

in your timeline, or from other timelines that share the same media.

This is particularly useful for reality shows or documentaries where the same clips can appear multiple

times in different parts of a program. Being able to simply show all existing grades in the Gallery frees

you from having to save a still for every grade you think you might eventually reuse.

The Timelines grade browser in the Gallery automatically shows all grades in the current timeline

The Gallery Management Window

While you can do quite a lot of stills management using the Gallery as it appears in the Color page, the

Gallery window provides additional functionality for copying stills among different projects and project

libraries, for organizing your stills and memories, and for accessing the DaVinci Resolve looks that

accompany the application.

To open the Gallery window:

Click the Gallery View button at the upper right-hand corner of the Gallery or select

Workspace > Gallery.

Gallery window

The Gallery opens into a floating window, divided into four areas:

�Stills navigator: Lets you navigate the contents of other projects and project libraries that are

available. Independent projects, as well as project library > user > project relationships, appear in

this hierarchical list. Click the disclosure triangle next to any item on this list to reveal its contents.

Click any project in the list to reveal its albums and stills in the Group Stills browser.

�Group Stills browser: Displays the contents of the currently selected item in the Stills navigator.

One or more selected stills can be copied to the current project by selecting an album in

the Project Stills browser, and dragging and dropping the selected stills to the Project Stills

browsing area.

�Project Stills browser: Contains the same Album list and Project Stills browser that’s visible in the

Color page Gallery.

�Project Memories: Provides a larger view of the project memories that are visible in the

Color page Gallery.

To resize different areas of the Gallery window:

�Move the pointer to the border between any areas of the Gallery. When the pointer changes to

the resize cursor, drag the border to resize the adjacent interface areas to whatever size you need.

Dragging all the way to the edge of the screen hides that interface area completely.

What’s Available in the Stills Navigator

The Stills Navigator accesses a variety of content via a hierarchical list. Disclosure triangles to the

left of each item in the Stills browser let you access the contents of each item, and many items have

several nested levels of content within, each accessed by its own disclosure triangle.

The Gallery Stills project library show all projects connected so you can import those stills

DaVinci Resolve looks: A collection of predefined grades, categorized by type, that provides

excellent examples of different looks available in DaVinci Resolve. These grades are installed

with DaVinci Resolve and cannot be altered.

Project Libraries: Each project library that’s available appears within this list. Each project

library has a nested series of users, projects, and timelines within, as well as one nested

PowerGrade item for each user, which provides access to the saved stills within.

Orphans: Stills are saved to a separate directory which is defined in the Master Settings panel

of the Project Settings. Whenever you delete a project library, the stills that corresponded to

that project library become orphaned. All orphaned stills that lack a connection to any current

project library appear within the Orphan item in the Stills Navigator.

Browse and Import Timeline Grades From Other Projects

The Gallery window lets you see and import grades in the timelines of other projects, even if they

weren’t saved as stills first. When you open the Gallery Window and use the hierarchical disclosure

controls of the Stills panel to open up and select a specific Project Library > User > Project > Timeline,

you’ll see at least three browsable albums to the right: the Stills galleries that were created, the

Memories, and at the bottom an album called Timeline Media. The Timeline Media album lets you

browse the currently used grades for every clip in that timeline, making it easy to copy the ones you

need to the current project’s Stills album or Memories.

This is particularly useful if you’re working on a series where and you find that you want to re-use

different grades, looks, adjustments, or fixes from previous episodes in the current one. Previously,

you’d have to remember to save every clip as a still to be able to browse the grades in this way. Now

you can simply browse the clips in the Timeline directly.
