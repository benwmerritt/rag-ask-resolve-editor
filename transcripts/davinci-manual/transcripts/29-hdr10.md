# HDR10+

DaVinci Resolve supports the new HDR10+ HDR format by Samsung. Please note that this support

is a work in progress as this is a new standard. When enabled, an HDR10+ palette exposes trimming

parameters that let you trim an automated downconversion of HDR to SDR, creating metadata to

control how HDR-strength highlights look on a variety of supported televisions and displays. This is

enabled and set up in the Color Management panel of the Project Settings with the Enable HDR10+

checkbox. Turning HDR10+ on enables the Dolby Vision palette in the Color page.

HDR Vivid

HDR Vivid is the HDR video technology standard released by the China UHD Video Industry Alliance

(CUVA). Mastering in this format assures wide compatibility with HDR televisions, phones, computers,

and other devices in China.

Lookup Tables

This group of controls lets you add LUTs to the Resolve image processing pipeline that affect every

timeline in the entire project all at once. These LUTs can be used for a wide variety of functions, such

as to trim Timeline grades, apply Log to Linear conversions, simulate film output, and limit the signal to

accommodate Broadcast Safe requirements.

Different options let you insert image processing to different stages of the pipeline as seen in the

following diagram:

Keep in mind that since you can apply both 1D and 3D LUTs simultaneously, 1D LUTs at each step are

always applied before 3D LUTs.

�Input Lookup Table: Two drop-down menus let you add 1D and/or 3D LUTs that process the

current Timeline before every other image processing operation in DaVinci Resolve.

�Output Lookup Table: Two drop-down menus let you add 1D and/or 3D LUTs that process the

current Timeline after the operations applied in the Color page, but before the temporarily

applied Display LUT.

�Video Monitor Lookup Table: Two drop-down menus let you add 1D and/or 3D LUTs that process

the current Timeline after every other image processing operation in DaVinci Resolve. However,

Display LUTs are only temporarily applied for purposes of monitoring; they’re never applied to

rendered media, or to the signal that is output to tape using the controls in the Deliver page.

Display LUTs are particularly valuable for applying a film print emulation LUT in a Log workflow, or

for applying a monitor calibration LUT if you’re outputting to a single display and you don’t have

dedicated outboard calibration hardware.

Here’s an example. It’s common, when grading for film output using a Log workflow, that you’ll

use the Display LUT drop-down menu to apply a film emulation LUT that simulates the image as it

will be output from the film recorder, taking into account the film lab and print stock used, in order

to make sure that the image you’re grading will appear as close as possible to what the eventual

release print will look like in the cinema.

�Color Viewer Lookup Table: Two drop-down menus let you add 1D and/or 3D LUTs that process

the image shown in the Viewer on your computer display, independently of the Display LUT that’s

used to output to your broadcast display. By default, this follows the Video Monitor LUT setting,

but you can also use this option to apply a specific calibration transform for your computer monitor.

Alternately, you could use it to desaturate the GUI Viewer to be able to specifically evaluate image

contrast, or if you don’t want to have to argue with your client over which display looks correct.

�Scopes Lookup Table: Ordinarily, DaVinci Resolve’s internal software video scopes provide an

unbiased analysis of the actual video data levels within the Resolve image processing pipeline.

However, you can choose to have the software scopes use the Video Monitor LUT selection, or

any other LUT installed on your system, to transform this analysis to reflect the monitored output.

�3D Lookup Table Interpolation: Lets you choose the processing quality of both LUT and DCTL

operations in DaVinci Resolve. 3D Lookup tables (LUTs) are 3D tables of red, green, and blue

values that specify an output color value for each input color value, thereby providing a method

of making color transformations using pre-calculated data. While powerful, 3D LUTs have finite

detail; for example, one might have a 17x17x17 LUT that specifies 4913 individual color transforms.

MEDIA

for, color values falling between the 17x17x17 color transforms specified by the LUT need to

be interpolated. You can choose from two methods that trade off processing efficiency for

higher quality:

Trilinear: (Default) Trilinear is backward compatible with grades that use LUTs from previous

versions of DaVinci Resolve and matches the look of LUTs being applied in other applications.

Tetrahedral: Tetrahedral is slightly more processor-intensive, but results in higher image quality

LUT and DCTL processing, with reduced color-banding. Tetrahedral is recommended for projects

that don’t need backward compatibility with previous versions of DaVinci Resolve or LUTs created

in other applications.

�Update Lists button: Refreshes the LUT drop-down menus if you’ve added new LUTs to your

system since DaVinci Resolve has been opened.

�Open LUT Folder button: This selection opens the master folder in your file system, as described

in the list of DaVinci Resolve LUT paths shown above.

Adding Lookup Tables to Your DaVinci Resolve Installation

The drop-down menus in the Color Management panel include a series of factory preset LUTs

that were installed with DaVinci Resolve, along with any LUTs that have been generated by

DaVinci Resolve, or that you’ve imported into the proper directory for your operating system.

•	 On macOS: Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/LUT/

•	 On Windows: C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\LUT

•	 On Linux: /opt/resolve/LUT

If you downloaded the non-studio version of DaVinci Resolve from the Apple App Store, LUTs

are saved in a different location in order for DaVinci Resolve to remain totally self-contained.

In this case, you can click the “Open LUT Folder” button in the Lookup Tables panel of the

Project Settings, to open up a Finder window at the location these LUTs are stored. You can

use this window to copy LUTs that you want Resolve to have access to, or delete LUTs that you

no longer need.

If you add a LUT to one of these directories after DaVinci Resolve has been opened, you can

click the Update Lists button to refresh the contents of the drop-down menus.

DaVinci Resolve uses both 1D and 3D LUTs. 3D LUTs that are created by DaVinci Resolve

are in the .cube format, configured as 33x33x33 cubes with 32-bit floating point processing.

DaVinci Resolve can also read and use LUTs in the Shaperlut format.

Broadcast Safe

Broadcast Safe settings can be enabled while you grade to limit both the luma and chroma of the

video signal to one of three levels of acceptable overshoots and undershoots.

�Broadcast safe IRE (mV) levels: A drop-down menu for choosing one of three levels

of aggressiveness when limiting the signal. Choose the range that corresponds to your

QC requirements.

�Make Broadcast Safe: A checkbox that turns broadcast safe limiting on and off.

NOTE: The clipping imposed by Broadcast Safe itself does not have an inherently soft

roll‑off. For best results, Broadcast Safe should be used in conjunction with the Soft Clip

controls in the Color page.

General Options

This panel presents a selection of general preferences that affect the interface and operation of

DaVinci Resolve.

Conform Options

The settings in this group determine how clips are conformed to match imported project files with

source media on disk by extracting timecode, reel names, file names, file paths, and so on.

For more information on conforming and relinking, see Chapter 56, “Conforming and

Relinking Clips.”

�Use Timecode: Determines how DaVinci Resolve extracts timecode from referenced media files.

There are two options:

Embedded in the source clip: The preferred setting for most projects to conform automatically and

apply grades to the resulting clips. As long as DaVinci Resolve can reference the timecode in either

a media file’s timecode track, or in the header metadata of the frames in a DPX sequence, you can

use timecode to reconform clips, or even completely change the media file to which a clip refers.

From the source clip frame count: This setting is useful if the source media lacks timecode

metadata, and all that’s available is a frame count that identifies frames via sequentially numbered

integer values.

�Conform partial clips with black gaps: Inserts black frames whenever you conform a clip that

doesn’t contain all the required frames. When this option is selected, partial clips are flagged in

the Edit page with a P in the thumbnail of the clip that it is lacking frames.

�Automatically conform missing clips added to Media Pool: Enabled by default, must be disabled

to use collaborative workflow. When this checkbox is turned on, DaVinci Resolve maintains a

dynamic relationship between clips in the Media Pool and those in a project’s various timelines.

When this checkbox is on and you import clips with matching timecode/file names/reel names to

clips in a timeline, DaVinci Resolve will automatically reconform all matching missing clips, and all

other timeline clips that have force conform turned off.

�Assist using reel names from the: When this checkbox is turned on, DaVinci Resolve uses reel

numbers when conforming clips to match any imported project. This setting must also be turned

on if you want to choose different reel name extraction methods for individually selected clips

using the Clip Attributes window. Turning this checkbox off forces DaVinci Resolve to identify

clips using file names when conforming XML and AAF projects. File names can only be used for

conforming XML or AAF files, or when importing a DaVinci Resolve project.

There are four options:

Source clip file pathname: Obtains the reel number by extracting it from each media file’s path.

This makes it possible to extract a reel number from all or part of the file name, or from all or part

of the name of any folder in the path that encloses that file. This extraction is defined using the

Pattern field.

Pattern: A code that defines how a reel number should be extracted from the source clip path name.

For more information about creating patterns in “Using the Pattern Field”, see Chapter 56,

“Conforming and Relinking Clips.”


Setup and Workflows | Chapter 6 Project Settings

MEDIA

Media Pool folder name: The reel number is obtained from the name of the bin in the Media Pool

that encloses that clip. This option is often used for stereo projects, deriving the reel number from

“Left” and “Right” named directories. It’s also useful for projects that are inheriting new VFX clips

on a daily basis.

Embedding in source clip file: Useful for file formats where the reel number is embedded within

the media file itself. QuickTime files created by Final Cut Pro, DPX frame files, and CinemaDNG

files are all formats that are capable of containing reel number header data.

Source clip filename: If there is no defined reel number, often it’s easy to just use the source clip

filename. This is a safe option to use in situations where you want to manually choose different

reel name extraction methods for individual clips using the Clip Attributes window.

�Limit reel name matching to X characters: For situations where you’ve been provided with media

files with extra characters in the reel name that don’t correspond to the names used in the project

file you’ve been given, “Limit reel name matching to X characters” lets you omit a specific number

of characters from the end of a reel name. This works in conjunction with the following setting.

�Ignore the first X characters of the reel name: For situations where you’ve been provided with

media files with extra characters in the reel name that don’t correspond to the names used in

the project file you’ve been given, “Ignore the first X characters of the reel name” lets you omit a

specific number of characters from the beginning of the reel name. Combined with the previous

setting, you can trim any reel name to a conformable subset of characters.

�Extract reel names from EDL comments: Media file formats such as R3D have reel names,

obtained from the file names, that are longer than the eight characters that are allowable in

a standard EDL. This option allows DaVinci Resolve to extract reel names from appropriately

formatted EDL comments, such as those output from Final Cut Pro 7.

�Sort timeline using reel number and timecode: Lets you change the behavior of C mode sorting

in the Timeline. With this checkbox turned on (the default), all clips in the Timeline are sorted by

reel number first, and then by source timecode. This way, clips with similar timecode from the

same reel will appear next to one another in C mode. If you turn this checkbox off, reel number is

ignored, and all clips in the Timeline are sorted only by source timecode. This may result in clips

from multiple sources being mixed together, but it is useful in specific situations.

�Mixed frame rate format: (Only available prior to importing media into a project) This drop-down

menu lets you choose the method used to conform mixed frame rates for rendering and playback.

Which option you choose dictates the accuracy with which retimed clips in DaVinci Resolve match

the same clips that were retimed in other editing applications when you import those timelines

into DaVinci Resolve via XML or AAF. This drop-down menu also appears in the Load AAF

or XML dialogs.

If you’re editing from scratch in DaVinci Resolve: You should leave this setting set to “Resolve.”

When importing timelines via XML from Apple software: Choose the “Final Cut Pro 7” or

“Final Cut Pro X” methods of conform.

When importing timelines via XML or AAF from Premiere Pro, Media Composer, Smoke, or

other NLEs: You should choose “Resolve.”

When none is selected: DaVinci Resolve conforms and processes all clips in the Timeline to play

at the frame rate that’s selected in the “Timeline frame rate” drop-down menu. For example, 23.98,

29.97, 30, 50, 59.94 and 60 fps clips will all play at 24 fps if that’s what “Timeline frame rate” is set

to in the Master Project Settings, and clips will play slower or faster accordingly.

How clips in mixed frame rate timelines are rendered out depends on whether the Render

Settings are set to render individual source clips or one single clip. When you render the Timeline

as individual source clips, all clips are rendered individually at their original frame rate. If you select

“single clip,” all clips are converted to the “Timeline frame rate” frame rate and rendered as a

single media file.
