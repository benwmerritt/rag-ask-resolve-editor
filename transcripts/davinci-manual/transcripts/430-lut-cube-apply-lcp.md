# LUT Cube Apply [LCP]

The LUT Cube Apply node

LUT Cube Apply Node Introduction

The LUT Cube Apply node takes an image created by the LUT Cube Creator as the foreground input

and applies that LUT to the image connected to the background input.

Feeding the original image into the node would result in an unaltered, or 1:1, output.

You can, however, modify, grade, and color correct the original cube image with as many nodes as

you like and feed the result into the LUT Cube Apply. Or, take a LUT image that has been graded

beforehand to apply the LUT without having to write an actual 3D LUT using the LUT Cube Analyzer.

Inputs

The LUT Cube Apply has three inputs: a green input where the output of the LUT Cube Creator is

connected, an orange input for the image to have the LUT applied, and a blue effect mask input

Input: This orange input accepts a 2D image that gets the LUT applied.

Reference Image: The green input is used to connect the output of the LUT Cube Creator or a node

that is modifying the image originating in the LUT Cube Creator.

Effect Mask: The optional effect mask input accepts a mask shape created by polylines, basic

primitive shapes, paint strokes, or bitmaps from other tools. Connecting a mask to this input limits the

LUT Cube Apply to only those pixels within the mask. An effects mask is applied to the tool after the

tool is processed.

Basic Node Setup

The example below shows a node tree starting with a LUT Cube Creator node and going through two

color adjustments. The adjusted image is then connected to the green Reference input of the LUT

Cube Apply. The image you want to apply the LUT to is connected to the orange Input.

The LUT generated by the LUT Cube Creator is applied to an image using the LUT Cube Apply node.

Inspector

There are no controls for the LUT Cube Apply node. The LUT connected to the green foreground input

is applied to the image connected to the orange background input without having to write an actual

3D LUT using the LUT Cube Analyzer.

Settings Tab

The Settings tab in the Inspector is also duplicated in other LUT nodes. These common controls are

described in detail at the end of this chapter in “The Common Controls” section.

LUT Cube Creator [LCC]

The LUT Cube Creator node

LUT Cube Creator Node Introduction

The LUT Cube Creator generates an image for further use with the LUT Cube Analyzer or LUT Cube

Apply nodes. The output can be graded, color corrected, or modified with any tool inside and outside

of Fusion. If working outside Fusion, make sure to keep the image in 32-bit floating point to preserve

color accuracy.

Feeding the original LUT Cube Creator image into the LUT Cube Analyzer node results in an

unaltered, or 1:1, LUT file, and nothing is displayed in the viewer.

Inputs

There are no inputs on the LUT Cube Creator. The purpose of the node is to generate an image that

can be used to create a LUT.

Basic Node Setup

The example below shows a node tree starting with a LUT Cube Creator node and going through two

color adjustments. The adjusted image is then connected into a LUT Cube Analyzer that generates

the LUT file.

Generating a LUT starts with the LUT Cube Creator and ends with a LUT Cube Analyzer.

LUT Cube Creator controls

Controls Tab

The Controls tab creates a test pattern of sorts used to create a 3D LUT. The controls here determine

the complexity of the pattern used to create a LUT using the LUT Cube Analyzer.

Type:

The Type menu is used to create a pattern of color cubes.

�Horizontal: Creates a long, horizontal strip representing a color cube.

�Vertical: Creates a long, vertical strip representing a color cube.

�Rect: Creates a rectangular image, as depicted below, representing a color cube.

Size

Determines the resolution of the color cube.

Typical Size settings for color cubes are 33 (33 x 33 x 33) or 65 (65 x 65 x 65). These numbers are the

samples on each side of the cube. A 33 x 33 x 33 cube has around 35,937 color samples.

NOTE: Higher resolutions yield more accurate results but are also more memory and

computationally expensive.

Settings Tab

The Settings tab in the Inspector is also duplicated in other LUT nodes. These common controls are

described in the following “The Common Controls” section.

The Common Controls

LUT nodes share a number of identical controls in the Inspector. This section describes controls that

are common among LUT nodes.

Common LUT Settings Inspector

Settings Tab

The Settings tab in the Inspector can be found on every tool in the LUT category. The controls are

consistent and work the same way for each tool, although some tools do include one or two individual

options, which are also covered here.

Use GPU

The Use GPU menu has three settings. Setting the menu to Disable turns off hardware-accelerated

rendering using the graphics card in your computer. Enabled uses the hardware. Auto uses a capable

GPU if one is available and falls back to software rendering when a capable GPU is not available.

Hide Incoming Connections

Enabling this checkbox can hide connection lines from incoming nodes, making a node tree appear

cleaner and easier to read. When enabled, empty fields for each input on a node are displayed in

the Inspector. Dragging a connected node from the node tree into the field hides that incoming

connection line as long as the node is not selected in the node tree. When the node is selected in the

node tree, the line reappears.

Comments

The Comments field is used to add notes to a tool. Click in the empty field and type the text. When a

note is added to a tool, a small red square appears in the lower-left corner of the node when the full

tile is displayed, or a small text bubble icon appears on the right when nodes are collapsed. To see the

note in the Node Editor, hold the mouse pointer over the node to display the tooltip.

Scripts

Three Scripting fields are available on every tool in Fusion from the Settings tab. They each contain

edit boxes used to add scripts that process when the tool is rendering. For more details on scripting

nodes, please consult the Fusion scripting documentation.
