VFX Connect

For instances where the various effects of the Edit, Fusion, and Color page aren’t

enough to achieve the effect you require, you can use the VFX Connect feature

of DaVinci Resolve to send one or more clips from the Edit page timeline to the

standalone version of Blackmagic Fusion, in order to do more robust compositing

and effects work there.

You can use this workflow in the macOS, Windows, and Linux versions of DaVinci Resolve, since

Fusion works on all three platforms.

This is a simple round-trip operation that lets you send clips from the DaVinci Resolve Timeline to

Fusion, add effects, and then render a finished effect out of Fusion that will automatically appear back

in your timeline.

Using VFX Connect

Sending one or more clips to the standalone version of Blackmagic Fusion is simple.

To send clips to Fusion:


Select one or more clips in the Timeline that you want to send to Fusion. In this example, two

superimposed clips are selected.

Selecting two clips to send to Fusion


Right-click one of the selected clips and choose New VFX Connect Clip from the contextual menu.

The New VFX Connect Clip dialog


In the New VFX Connect Clip dialog, choose the following options:

a)	 Enter a name.

b)	 Choose a video format (for rendering media to send to Fusion).

c)	 Choose a codec, based on the format you selected.

d)	 If you want to send Alpha channels to Fusion, turn the Export Alpha checkbox on. This exports

alpha channels that are embedded in a clip, as well as alpha channels that are being created

in DaVinci Resolve.

e)	 If you want to save the VFX Connect Clip that you’re creating, along with its directory and

media, to a specific location, turn on the Custom Location checkbox, then click the Browse

button and choose a location. Otherwise, the directory containing the VFX Connect clip and

any source media rendered along with it is placed in the same directory as the scratch disk.

f)

If you want to immediately open Fusion, turn on the “Open VFX Connect Clip” checkbox.

If you do this, then DaVinci Resolve by default renders each of the video clips you selected,

along with every speed effect, transform, and Color page operation that’s been applied to

each clip, using the Timeline Color Space. However, if you click Cancel when the Render

Composition Media dialog appears, then the Fusion project that opens references the source

media on disk, rather than rendered media that’s generated by DaVinci Resolve.


When you’re finished, click Create. DaVinci Resolve creates a VFX Connect clip, which appears in

the Timeline as a single clip and in the Media Pool.

Opening the VFX Connect clip in Fusion can be done in one of two ways:

�If you turned on “Open VFX Connect Clip,” then Fusion automatically opens and the clips you

selected appear as Loader nodes within Fusion.

�If you didn’t, then you can right-click the VFX Connect clip in the Media Pool, and choose VFX

Connect > Open Fusion from the contextual menu.

At this point, new media is rendered (by default), Fusion opens, and the clips you sent are

converted into a Fusion node tree, explained in greater detail in the following section.


In Fusion, use the available tools to create the required effect.

EDIT


Optionally, before you render, if you want to change the Output Format, click the Output node,

and choose a new format from the Output Format pop-up in the Tools tab. If you don’t do this, the

Fusion composite will be rendered using the format you selected when you sent the VFX Connect

clip in the first place.

information governing the rendered output


When you’re finished creating your effect in Fusion, click the Render button to open the Render

Settings, check to make sure that the settings are correct, and click Start Render. This renders the

Fusion composition to the disk location and using the name that you chose in step 3.

Selecting two clips to send to Fusion


A Render Settings dialog appears, which lets you choose how you want to render the output,

with options including the Quality, Frame Range, and Size of the media being output. If the default

settings are good, click Start Render. A progress bar indicates how long the render will take.

For more information, consult the Fusion User Manual.

10	 Once rendering has finished, save your Fusion project, reopen DaVinci Resolve, and you should

see that the VFX Connect clip in the Timeline has updated to show the new effect you created

in Fusion.

EDIT

How Clips are translated into Node Trees

In Fusion, each clip that you send appears as a Loader node that is linked to that clip’s media on disk. If

you selected multiple clips, each clip is superimposed over the one just below it using a Merge node,

which lets you merge two images at a time with an Over operator by default.

Two superimposed clips sent to Fusion as represented in the Fusion node tree

With this as your starting point, you can add nodes (called Tools in Fusion) to apply operations

of your own, in order to create more sophisticated effects and composites. For more information

about using Fusion, see the Fusion Reference Manual, available from the Support page at the

Blackmagic Design web site.

Altering VFX Connect Clips

If, at any point, you want to modify the Fusion composition, you can reopen the project in Fusion,

or right-click the VFX Connect clip in the DaVinci Resolve Media Pool and choose VFX Connect >

Open in Fusion. Once in Fusion, make whatever changes you want to, and then re-render the clip to

overwrite the previously rendered media. When you create new versions in this way, each version’s

Fusion project file and rendered output is maintained and preserved, so you can always go back

and forth.

When you return to DaVinci Resolve, you may need to right-click the VFX Connect clip you just

opened, and choose VFX Connect > Refresh to make sure that DaVinci Resolve correctly sees the re-

rendered media from Fusion.

Creating Multiple Versions of Fusion Clips

If you want to render a new version, but you want to keep the previous version, then you can right-click

the VFX Connect clip in the Resolve Media Pool and choose VFX Connect > Create New Version.

EDIT

This creates a duplicate of the composite in Fusion, with the “_v1” part of the filename incremented so

it doesn’t overwrite the previous version of that composite.

Once in Fusion, make whatever changes you need to the composite, then re-render the clip to

generate an additional piece of media for that version. The filename of the Saver node for the new

media you’re rendering is also automatically incremented with the “_v1” segment of the filename

changed to the next version number, such as “_v2” if it’s version two of the effect.

The Tools panel shows the Saver node’s updated

filename for the new version’s rendered output

When you’re finished, you’ll end up with a Fusion Project file and a corresponding rendered media file

that share the same version number. When you return to DaVinci Resolve, Resolve will automatically

detect that there are multiple versions in the VFX Connect directory, and will make each version

available via a Choose Version submenu for VFX Connect clips in the Media Pool.

Switching Versions of VFX Connect Clips in DaVinci Resolve

Once you’ve created multiple versions of a VFX Connect clip, you can switch which version is used for

that clip in DaVinci Resolve by right-clicking the VFX Connect clip in the Media Pool, and choosing the

version from the VFX Connect > Select Version submenu of the contextual menu.

Choosing which version to use from the VFX Connect > Select Version submenu

TIP: If you want to switch versions for a VFX Connect clip in a timeline, you can right-click

that clip and choose Find in Media Pool.
