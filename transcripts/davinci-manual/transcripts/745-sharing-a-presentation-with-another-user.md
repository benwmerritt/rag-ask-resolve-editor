# Sharing a Presentation with Another User

You can share a presentation with up to 10 other users. The only requirement is that each user has

their own Blackmagic Cloud account.

The information panel

of a presentation

To Share a Blackmagic Cloud Presentation


Click on the information icon (the circled letter i) next to the presentation name. A Members pane

is exposed, showing all the current users that the presentation is shared with. The user with the

crown icon is the presentation administrator, and only they can add or remove users.


Click on the Share button at the bottom of the Members pane.


Enter the email address (used to create the Blackmagic Cloud account) of the user you wish to

share the presentation with.


Click on the Share button.

The user’s name will now appear in the Members pane, and the presentation will show up in their

own My Presentations column when logging into the Blackmagic Cloud. They can now watch any

clips, video conference, or make comments in that presentation.

Additionally, an email will be sent to the user’s email address, notifying them of the

presentation and a direct link to access it.

To remove a user from a presentation, simply click on the “x” next to their name in the

Members panel. Only the administrator can add or remove members.

Enabling and Disabling a Presentation

The administrator can choose to temporarily disable a presentation. This is used to temporarily lock

access to the presentation without deleting it. This keeps all the clips, users, and comments in place

and only prevents the presentation being viewed or modified until it’s enabled again.

To Enable or Disable a Blackmagic Cloud Presentation


Click on the Information icon (the circled letter i) next to the presentation name.


Click on the Presentation enabled switch directly below the presentation name to toggle between

enabling and disabling the presentation.

Renaming a Presentation

The administrator can easily rename a presentation to more accurately describe its

purpose or contents.

To Rename a Blackmagic Cloud Presentation


Click on the Information icon (the circled letter i) next to the presentation name.


Click on the Settings icon (the small gear) next to the presentation name.


Select Rename from the drop-down menu.


Type in the new name for the presentation.


Click on the Save button.

The presentation’s name will be then updated in the My Presentations column for all users.

Deleting a Presentation

When you’ve finished with a presentation, the administrator can delete it from the Blackmagic Cloud. A

deleted presentation permanently removes all clips and comments and is not undoable, so make sure

you are completely finished before you delete it.

To Delete a Blackmagic Cloud Presentation


Click on the Information icon (the circled letter i) next to the presentation name.


Click on the Settings icon (the small gear) next to the presentation name.


Select Delete from the drop-down menu.


Click on the Delete button in the warning dialog box.

Leaving a Presentation

As a user you can leave a Presentation at any time. This removes permission for you to view and edit

the presentation, and removes it from your My Presentations column. If you wish to gain access to a

presentation again once you’ve left, the presentation administrator must re-share it with you.

To Leave a Blackmagic Cloud Presentation


Click on the Information icon (the circled letter i) next to the presentation name.


Click on the Settings icon (the small gear) next to the presentation name.


Select Leave from the drop-down menu.


Click on the Leave button in the warning dialog box.

Using Presentations

The heart of Presentations is the Viewer; here you can both video conference and control the

playback of a clip. The Viewer provides a low latency, streaming video that you can use to accurately

mark and comment on, as those comments show up in real time to other users and on the DaVinci

Resolve timeline.

Video Conferencing

The top strip of the Viewer contains a basic video conferencing interface, with each user’s video

stream appearing in a live thumbnail. By default the camera and microphone are turned off, so you will

need to switch them on manually.

The video conferencing interface; note the Camera and Microphone on/off controls in the upper right.

To Turn On and Off the Camera and Microphone for a Blackmagic Cloud Presentation


Click on the Camera and/or Microphone icons in the upper right of the Viewer.


Give your OS and browser appropriate permissions to use the devices.


To turn off the Camera and Microphone, click their respective icons again.

With your camera and microphone on, all other connected users will see and hear you through their

web browsers, so be generous and discrete with your comments.

Controlling a Clip in the Viewer

Each user can view and comment on any of the clips (including the same clip) in real time. The

Viewer for each user is independent of all the others, though the administrator has the option to sync

everyone’s Viewer to their own, in order to watch the same clip at the same time.

Selecting a Clip

Selecting a clip to view is as easy as clicking on the clip’s thumbnail in the Clips column. Clips are

sortable by date, duration, and name in ascending or descending order. The Clips column is also

searchable by clicking on the magnifying glass to the right and entering your search terms. Only clips

matching your search terms will be shown. You can also hover your pointer over the clip thumbnail to

scrub through the video.

The Clips column

Administrators can edit the names, and delete clips from the presentation by hovering over

the thumbnail and selecting the appropriate icons (pencil and trashcan) in the upper right.

Viewer Controls

The Presentations Viewer has a set of playback controls at the bottom of the browser that you can use

to position your playhead exactly.

The Viewer controls

Jog Bar: The long line across the bottom of the browser shows your current

playhead position as a rectangle and any markers that have been set. You can click

and drag the playhead to scrub back and forth in the clip.

Timecode: The timecode of the current clip that refers back to the original

DaVinci Resolve timeline.

Previous Clip: (Up Arrow) Loads the clip above the current clip in the Clips column

into the Viewer. If the current clip is already at the top of the stack, it will wrap around

to the clip at the bottom.

Stop: Stops playback of the clip in the Viewer.

Play: Plays the clip in the Viewer forward at 1x speed.

Next Clip: (Down Arrow) Loads the clip below the current clip in the Clips column

into the Viewer. If the current clip is already at the bottom of the stack, it will wrap

around to the clip at the top.

Loop: Toggles between no looping (the default), Loop One which will loop the

current clip over and over, and Loop All which will play back all the clips in the Clips

column and loop back to the beginning of the stack.

Volume: Clicking on this icon mutes the audio. Dragging the slider next to the icon

controls the volume of the clip.

Start Sync: (Administrator only), clicking this icon allows the contents of your Viewer

to display for all members. The administrator’s view overrides the Viewers of all the

other users, ensuring that everyone is watching the same thing at the same time.

Add Marker: Clicking this icon adds a marker at the playhead position. Editing and

commenting on this marker is done in the Markers column described below.

Full Screen: This expands the Viewer to take up the entire screen.

NOTE: You can move the playhead frame by frame forward and back by using the left and

right arrow keys respectively.
