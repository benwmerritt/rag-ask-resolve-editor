# Resolve Parameter

The Resolve Parameter Modifier is used when creating a transition template in Fusion for use in

DaVinci Resolve’s Edit page or Cut page. When building a transition in Fusion, the Resolve Parameter

modifier is added to any control you want to animate. The Resolve Parameter modifier automatically

animates the parameter for the duration of the transition, allowing you to trim the transition in the Edit

page or Cut page.

For example, to create a cross dissolve, do the following:


From the Effects Library, add a Fusion Composition to the Edit page Timeline.


In Fusion, add a Dissolve node to the Node Editor.


In the Inspector, right-click the Background/Foreground parameter, and then choose Resolve

Parameter from the Modifier contextual menu. Adding the modifier to the Background/Foreground

parameter automatically updates the slider if the transition is modified back on the Edit/Cut page.


In the Node Editor, right-click the Dissolve node and choose Macro > Create Macro.


When creating a macro that’s to be used as a Fusion transition it’s important that two inputs and

one output are selected in the Macro Editor. In this example, under the Dissolve heading, enable

the Output, Background and Foreground check boxes.


Give the transition a name, then save the macro from the top File menu.Save the macro in the

following folder so it appears the Edit page or Cut page Effects Library:

For MacOS: $TEMPLATE_MAC_OS_PATH/Transitions or $TEMPLATE_MAC_

USER_PATH/Transitions

For Windows: $TEMPLATE_WIN_OS_PATH\Transitions or $TEMPLATE_WIN_

USER_PATH\Transitions


Quit and reopen DaVinci Resolve to update the list of transitions in the Effects Library.


On the Edit page, open the Effects Library. Navigate to Video Transitions Fusion Transitions, and

the custom Fusion transition will be listed.

Shake

The Shake modifier is used to randomize a Position or Value control to create semi-random numeric

inputs. The resulting shake can be entirely random. The motion can also be smoothed for a more

gentle, organic feel.

To add the Shake modifier to a parameter, select Modify With > Shake from the parameter’s contextual

menu. The Shake modifier uses the following controls to achieve its effect. It can be applied by right-

clicking a parameter and selecting Modify With > Shake.

Controls Tab

Random Seed

The Random Seed control contains the value used to seed the random number generator. Given the

same seed, a random number generator always produces the same results. Change the seed if the

results from the randomizer are not satisfying.

Smoothness

This control is used to smooth the overall randomness of the Shake. The higher the value, the

smoother the motion appears. A value of zero generates completely random results, with no

smoothing applied.

Lock X/Y

This checkbox is used to unlock the X- and Y-axis, revealing independent slider controls for each axis.

Minimum and Maximum

This control is used to determine the overall strength of the shake. The low values represent the

lowest value that can be generated by the randomizer, and the high values represent the highest

values. To create a Shake that moves a center crosshair anywhere within the image, set the Minimum

to 0.0 and the Maximum to 1.0. To restrict the motion to a smaller shake in the bottom-right corner of

the image, set the Minimum to 0.70 and the Maximum to 0.90.

Example

•	 Create a new comp, and then add and view a Text node.

•	 Type some text in the Text node.

•	 In the viewer, right-click over the Center control of the text and choose Modify With >

Shake Position.

•	 In the Inspector, select the Modifiers tab and set the smoothing to 5.0.

•	 Set the Minimum to 0.1 and the Maximum to 0.9.

This adds some chaotic movement to the text. However, we can change this over Go to

frame 0 and in the Inspector click the Keyframe button to the right of both the Minimum and

the Maximum controls.

•	 Go to frame 0 and in the Inspector click the Keyframe button to the right of both the

Minimum and the Maximum controls.

•	 Go to frame 90 and adjust the Minimum to 0.45 and the Maximum to 0.55.

•	 View the results.

Now, the text starts out by flying all over the screen and tightens in toward the center of the

screen as the comp plays.

Track

Although there is a standard Tracker node, you can also use a Tracker modifier to add a tracker

directly to a parameter. To apply the Tracker modifier, in the viewer right-click the Center control

of any transform, text, mask, or other positionable element. From the contextual menu, choose

Object x Center > Modify With > Tracker.

Then choose one of three options:

�Tracker Position: Tracks a point from the source.

�Steady Position: Stabilizes based on a single point in the source.

�Unsteady Position: Adds original motion back after stabilizing.

This adds a modifier in the Inspector with a set of controls almost identical to those found in the

Tracker node itself.

The Tracker modifier

For an in-depth explanation of this node, see Chapter 119, "Tracking Nodes," in the

DaVinci Resolve Reference Manual, or Chapter 59 in the Fusion Reference Manual.

Tracker Modifier vs. Tracker Node

The differences between a Tracker modifier and a Tracker node are as follows:

�The Tracker modifier can only track a single pattern.

�The Tracker modifier can only output a single value and cannot be used for complex stabilization

or match-moving procedures.

�The default source image for the modifier is the node immediately upstream of the node that

contains the modifier (i.e., when adding a Tracker modifier to a Glow node with a Loader as its

input, the Tracker Source input defaults to the output of the Loader). Set a different source image

for the Tracker modifier by typing in the name of the node. Alternatively, drag the source node

from the Node Editor into the Text Box control.

Example

Imagine that you need to track an actor’s eyes so that an unearthly, alien glow can be applied

to the eyes.

•	 Select the Loader node.

•	 Add a Glow node.

•	 Add an Ellipse mask to the Glow in the shape of one of the eyes.

•	 Right-click the center of that mask and select Modify With > Tracker > Position.

Since the track is on the mask, the tracker takes the glow as the image for tracking. This

could cause problems since the eye might be very obscured by the glow. A cleaner source

will be the Loader that feeds the glow.

•	 Drag the Loader into the modifier Inspector’s Track Source field.

•	 Track the actor’s eye.

•	 Perform the same steps on the other eye.

Vector Result

The Vector Result modifier is used to offset positional controls, such as crosshairs, by distance and

angle. These can be static or animated values.

It can be applied by right-clicking a control and selecting Modify With > Vector.

Inspector

The Vector Result modifier Controls tab


Fusion Page Effects | Chapter 124 Modifiers

FUSION

Controls Tab

Origin

This control is used to represent the position from which the vector’s distance and angle values

originate.

Distance

This slider control is used to determine the distance of the vector from the origin.

Angle

This thumbwheel control is used to determine the angle of the vector relative to the origin.

Image Aspect

This slider control is used primarily to compensate for image aspect differences. A square image of

500 x 500 would use an Image Aspect value of 1, while a rectangular image of 500 x 1000 would

use an Image Aspect value of 2. The default for this value is taken from the current Frame Format

preferences using width/height. It may be necessary to modify this control to match the current image.

Example

•	 Create a 100-frame comp.

•	 Create a simple node tree consisting of a black background and a Text node foreground

connected to a Merge.

•	 Enter some text in the Text node.

•	 Select the Merge node.

•	 In the viewer, right-click the Center control of the Merge and choose Modify With >

Vector Result.

This adds a crosshair onscreen control for the Vector distance and angle. The onscreen

control represents the Distance and Angle controls displayed in the Modifiers tab.

•	 In the Modifiers tab of the Inspector, drag the Distance control to distance the text from the

Vector origin.

•	 Drag the Angle thumbwheel to rotate the text around the Vector origin.

•	 This is different from changing a pivot point, since the text itself is not rotating.

•	 These points are animatable and can be connected to other controls.

•	 In the Inspector, right-click the Origin control and choose a path to add a motion path

modifier to the Origin control.

•	 Verify that the current frame is set to frame 0 (zero) and use the Origin controls in the

Inspector or drag the Vector Origin crosshair to the bottom-left corner of the screen.

•	 On the Vector Angle thumbwheel, click the Keyframe button to animate this control.

•	 Set the Angle thumbwheel to a value of 10.

•	 Go to frame 100 and click at the top-left corner of the screen to move the

Vector Origin crosshair.

•	 Set the Vector Angle thumbwheel to a value of 1000.

•	 Play the comp to see the results.

This causes the text to orbit around the path just created.
