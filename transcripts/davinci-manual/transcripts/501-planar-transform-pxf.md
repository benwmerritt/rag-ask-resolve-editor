# Planar Transform [Pxf]

The Planar Transform node

The Planar Transform node applies perspective distortions generated by a Planar Tracker node onto

any input mask or masked image. The Planar Transform node can be used to reduce the amount

of time spent on rotoscoping objects. The workflow here centers around the notion that the Planar

Tracker node can be used to track objects that are only roughly planar. After an object is tracked,

a Planar Transform node can then be used to warp a rotospline, making it approximately follow the

object over time. Fine-level cleanup work on the rotospline then must be done.

Depending on how well the Planar Tracker followed the object, this can result in substantial time

savings in the amount of tedious rotoscoping. The key to using this technique is recognizing situations

where the Planar Tracker performs well on an object that needs to be rotoscoped.

A rough outline of the workflow involved is:


Track: Using a Planar Tracker node, select a pattern that represents the object to be rotoscoped.

Track the shot (see the tracking workflow in the Track section for the Planar Tracker node).


Create a Planar Transform node: Press the Create Planar Transform button on the Planar Tracker

node to do this. The newly created Planar Transform node can be freely cut and pasted into

another composition as desired.


Rotoscope the object: Move to any frame that was tracked by the Planar Tracker. When unsure if a

frame was tracked, look in the Spline Editor for a tracking keyframe on the Planar Transform node.

Connect a Polygon node into the Planar Transform node. While viewing the Planar Transform

node, rotoscope the object.


Refine: Scrub the timeline to see how well the polygon follows the object. Adjust the polyline on

frames where it is off. It is possible to add new points to further refine the polygon.

Inputs

The Planar Transform has only two inputs:

Image Input: The orange image input accepts a 2D image on which the transform will be applied.

Effect Mask: The blue input is for a mask shape created by polylines, basic primitive shapes, paint

strokes, or bitmaps from other tools. Connecting a mask to this input limits the output of the Planar

Transform to certain areas.

Basic Node Setup

The example below uses a Planar Transform node between a masked MediaIn2 node and the

foreground input to a Merge node. The background MediaIn1 node connects to the Planar Tracker,

which was used to generate the Planar Transform. Once the Planar Transform is created, the Planar

Tracker is no longer needed in the node tree.

Controls Tab

The Planar Transform node has very few controls, and they are all located in the Controls tab. It’s

designed to apply the analyzed Planar Tracking data as a match move,

Reference Time

This is the reference time that the pattern was taken from in the Planar Tracker node used to produce

the Planar Transform.

Right-Click Here for Track Spline

The Track spline contains information about the perspective distortions stored in 4 x 4 matrices.

When a Planar Transform node is exported from a Planar Tracker node, the Track spline produced

by the Planar Tracker is shared by connecting it with the Planar Transform node. A consequence of

this sharing of the Track spline is that if the track is changed in the Planar Tracker node, the Planar

Transform will be automatically updated. Note that this spline can be examined in the Spline Editor,

which is useful for seeing the extent of tracked frames.

Common Controls

Settings Tab

The Settings tab in the Inspector is also duplicated in other Tracking nodes. These common controls

are described in detail at the end of this chapter in “The Common Controls” section.

Resize [RSZ]

The Resize node

Resize Node Introduction

Use the Resize node to increase or decrease the resolution of an input image. This is useful for

converting images from one format to another (for example, from film to video resolution). This node

actually changes the resolution of the image.

NOTE: Because this node changes the physical resolution of the image, animating the

controls is not advised.

Inputs

The single input on the Resize node is used to connect a 2D image for resizing.

Input: The orange input is used for the primary 2D image you want to resize.

Basic Node Setup

Below, the Resize node is inserted between the MediaIn1 node and the background input of the

Merge. Unlike using a Transform tool, resizing the MediaIn1 changes the resolution of the clip. The

resized MediaIn1 node connected to the orange background input also sets the resolution of the

Merge output.

The Resize node can be used to scale an image and change its resolution.

Inspector

The Resize Controls tab

Controls Tab

The Controls tab includes parameters for changing the resolution of the image. It uses pixel values in

the Width and Height controls.

Width

This controls the new resolution for the image along the X-axis.

Height

This controls the new resolution for the image along the Y-axis.

TIP: You can use the formatting contextual menu to quickly select a resolution from a list.

Place the mouse pointer over the Width or Height controls, and then right-click to display

the contextual menu. The bottom of the menu displays a Select Frame Format submenu with

available frame formats. Select any one of the choices from the menu to set the Height and

Width controls automatically.

Auto Resolution

Activating this checkbox automatically sets the Width and Height sliders to the Frame Format settings

found in the Preferences window for Fusion Studio or the resolution in the DaVinci Resolve Timeline.

Reset Size

Resets the image dimensions to the original size of the image.

Keep Frame Aspect

When toggled on, the Resize node maintains the aspect of the original image, preserving the original

ratio between width and height.

Only Use Filter in HiQ

The Resize node will normally use the fast Nearest Neighbor filter for any non-HiQ renders, where

speed is more important than full accuracy. Disable this checkbox to force Resize to always use the

selected filter for all renders.

Change Pixel Aspect

Enable this checkbox to reveal a Pixel Aspect control that can be used to change the image’s pixel aspect.

Filter Method

When rescaling a pixel, surrounding pixels are often used to give a more realistic result. There are

various algorithms for combining these pixels, called filters. More complex filters can give better

results but are usually slower to calculate. The best filter for the job often depends on the amount of

scaling and on the contents of the image itself.

�Box: This is a simple interpolation resize of the image.

�Linear: This uses a simplistic filter, which produces relatively clean and fast results.

�Quadratic: This filter produces a nominal result. It offers a good compromise between

speed and quality.

�Cubic: This produces better results with continuous-tone images. If the images have fine detail in

them, the results may be blurrier than desired.

�Catmull-Rom: This produces good results with continuous-tone images that are resized down.

This produces sharp results with finely detailed images.

�Gaussian: This is very similar in speed and quality to Bi-Cubic.

�Mitchell: This is similar to Catmull-Rom but produces better results with finely detailed images.

It is slower than Catmull-Rom.

�Lanczos: This is very similar to Mitchell and Catmull-Rom but is a little cleaner and also slower.

�Sinc: This is an advanced filter that produces very sharp, detailed results; however, it may produce

visible “ringing” in some situations.

�Bessel: This is similar to the Sinc filter but may be slightly faster.

Window Method (Sinc and Bessel Only)

Some filters, such as Sinc and Bessel, require an infinite number of pixels to calculate exactly. To

speed up this operation, a windowing function is used to approximate the filter and limit the number of

pixels required. This control appears when a filter that requires windowing is selected.

�Hanning: This is a simple tapered window.

�Hamming: Hamming is a slightly tweaked version of Hanning that does not taper all the

way down to zero.

�Blackman: A window with a more sharply tapered falloff.

�Kaiser: A more complex window with results between Hamming and Blackman.

Most of these filters are useful only when making an image larger. When shrinking images, it is

common to use the Bi-Linear filter; however, the Catmull-Rom filter will apply some sharpening

to the results and may be useful for preserving detail when scaling down an image.

Example

Different resize filters. From left to right: Nearest Neighbor, Box, Linear, Quadratic, Cubic,

Catmull-Rom, Gaussian, Mitchell, Lanczos, Sinc, and Bessel.
