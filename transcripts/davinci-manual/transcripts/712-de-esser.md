# De-Esser

A repair plugin specific to dialog. The De-Esser is a specialized filter that’s designed to reduce

excessive sibilance, such as hissing “s” sounds or sharp “ts” sounds, in dialogue or vocals.

A graph shows you which part of the signal the controls are set up to adjust, while reduction and

output meters let you see which part of the signal is affected and what level is being output.

The De-Esser Fairlight FX

The De-Esser has the following controls:

�Bypass: Toggles this plugin on and off.

�Listen to Ess Only: This checkbox at the top right lets you listen only to the ess that is being

removed. This is very useful to determine if too much signal is being removed or if more ess

attenuation can be applied.

�Frequency Range: Two controls let you target the frequency of the “s” sound for a

particular speaker.

Target Frequency: A knob that lets you target the frequency of the offending sibilance. Sibilant

sounds are usually found in the range of 5 - 8kHz.

Range: switches the operational mode of the De-Esser. Three choices (from top to bottom) let you

switch among Narrow Band, Wide Band, and All High Frequency which processes all audio above

the source frequency.

�Amount: Adjusts the amount de-essing that’s applied.

�Reaction Time: Adjusts how suddenly de-essing is applied. There are three choices.

Slow: Equivalent to a slow attack.

Medium: Equivalent to a medium attack.

Fast: Equivalent to a fast attack.

De-Hummer

A repair plugin with general applications to any recording. Eliminates hum noise that often stems

from electrical interference with audio equipment due to improper cabling or grounding. Typically

50 or 60 cycle hum is a harmonic noise, consisting of a fundamental frequency and subsequent partial

harmonics starting at twice this fundamental frequency.

A graph lets you see the frequency and harmonics being targeted as you adjust this plugin’s controls.

The De-Hummer Fairlight FX

De-Hummer has the following controls:

�Bypass: Toggles this plugin on and off.

�Listen to Hum only: This checkbox at the top right lets you listen only to the hum that is being

removed. This is very useful to determine if too much signal is being removed or if more hum

attenuation can be applied.

�Frequency: Target source fundamental frequency. A knob lets you make a variable frequency

selection, while radio buttons let you select common frequencies that correspond to 50Hz/60Hz

electrical mains that are the typical culprits for causing hum.

�Amount: Adjusts how much De-Hum extraction you want to apply.

�Slope: Adjusts the ratio of fundamental frequency to partial harmonics, the adjustment of which

lets makes it possible for various kinds of hum to be targeted. For example, a value of 0 biases

hum extraction towards the fundamental frequency, while a value of 0.5 gives equal extraction of

all harmonics (up to 4), and finally a value of 1.0 targets the higher frequency partials.

Delay

An effects plugin. A general purpose stereo delay effect, suitable for tasks varying from track

doubling, to early reflection generation, through simple harmonic enhancement. Processes in stereo

or mono, depending on the track it’s applied to.

A graph shows the timing and intensity of the echoes generated by this plugin on each channel, and

an Output meter displays the output level of the resulting signal.

The Delay Fairlight FX

Delay has the following controls:

�Bypass: Toggles this plugin on and off.

�Input Format: (Only visible when Delay is inserted on a multi-channel track.) Lets you choose

how multiple channels are input to the delay. Stereo sets separate Left and Right channels.

Mono sums Left and Right to both channels. Left inputs the Left channel only, and Right inputs the

Right channel only.

�Filters: Alters the proportion of frequencies that are included in the delay effect. When the

Delay plugin is inserted on a Mono Channel, the Left and Right sections are replaced with a

single “Delay” section.

Low Cut (Hz): A global High Pass filter.

High Cut (Hz): A global Low Pass filter.

�Delay: Adjusts the timing of the delay.

Left/Right Delay (ms): Delay time of each channel.

Left/Right Feedback (%): Feedback % of the Left or Right channel back to itself. A negative value

equates to % of feedback with a phase reverse from the original signal.

�Feedback: Controls for adjusting the amount of bleed between channels.

High Ratio: Adjusts the frequency of a damping filter for the feedback signal.

Stereo Blend: Adjusts the proportion of signal from Left and Right channel feedback which feeds

into the opposite channel. When the Delay plugin is inserted on a Mono channel, Stereo Blend

control does not appear.

�Output: Controls for adjusting the final output from this plugin.

Dry/Wet (%): A percentage control of the output mix of “dry” or original signal to “wet” or

processed signal. 0 is completely dry, 100% is completely wet.

Output Level (dB): Adjusts the overall output level of the affected sound.

Dialogue Processor

The Dialogue Processor chains together six different common audio processing operations inside

of a single plugin, each tuned to the specific needs of adjustments to improve recorded dialog. The

specialized De-Rumble, De-Pop, De-Ess, Comp(ressor), Expander, and Excite controls each have a

streamlined set of controls tailored to the specific types of common adjustments that may be required

for a great sounding dialogue track.

The Dialogue Processor plugin

�De-Rumble: The de-rumble filter is a high pass filter that allows you to remove subsonic rumble

(subharmonic low frequencies) in your vocal microphone signal. A safe value to use for most

condenser microphones is 40 or 50Hz. Using higher values can start to remove lower frequencies

in the source signal, which can be a useful creative effect at times.

Frequency: Sets the high-pass filter to frequencies between 40Hz to 235Hz.

�De-Pop: Controls the center frequency for a specialized filter for removal of vocal “popping”

sounds, or plosives, that can occur when someone speaks close to a microphone capsule on-axis.

Frequency: Sets the filter to frequencies between 50Hz to 200Hz.

Amount: Sets the amount of the filter effect on the signal with lower values effecting less

and higher values effecting more. A meter next to the amount knob shows how the signal is

being effected.

�De-Ess: Sets the center point of a specialized bandpass filter for removal of vocal “Esses,” which

can be overly present due to sibilance. De-essing allows you to raise average level and brighten a

vocal source without it sounding harsh, as our ears are very sensitive to overly present sibilance.

The best frequency range for male and female voices tends to be between 6 and 7 kHz.

Frequency: Sets the filter to frequencies between 700Hz to 9000Hz.

Amount: Sets the amount of the filter effect on the signal with lower values effecting less

and higher values effecting more. A meter next to the amount knob shows how the signal is

being effected.

�Compressor: Used to compress a signal’s dynamic range by reducing differences in level

between the loudest and quietest parts of the input signal. Compression can be used to raise

the signal’s overall level, boosting it without clipping and thus increasing perceived loudness.

Compression is often used to give voices more presence within a mix and to smooth out changes

in the levels of tracks that may have too much dynamic range for its context.

Threshold (dB): Sets the level at which the signal will start to be effected from –40dB to –8dB.

Amount: Sets the amount of the compression on the signal with lower values effecting less and

higher values effecting more. A meter next to the amount knob shows how the signal is being

effected.

Fast/Slow: Determines the speed at which the effect is applied, fast or slow.

�Expander: Emphasizes differences in volume by lowering the level of soft parts of the signal

relative to the level of louder parts and can be used to minimize noise while increasing the

dynamic range of a signal.

Threshold (dB): Sets the level at which the signal will start to be effected from –40dB to –8dB.

Range: Amount of decrease in signal level in dB, as expansion lowers the softer parts of the

signal.

Fast/Slow: Determines the speed at which the effect is applied, fast or slow.

�Excite: Synthesizes additional high frequency content in a source signal, using various techniques.

Used subtly, it can add more presence to sounds that may be overly dull without having to use EQ.

Amount: Sets the amount of the exciter on the signal with lower values effecting less and higher

values effecting more. A meter next to the amount knob shows how the signal is being effected.

Female/Male: Tailors the exciter’s response to be optimized for a male or female voice.

Dialogue Leveler

The Dialogue Leveler analyzes source material to detect dialogue, and then “ride down” louder areas,

“lift up” softer areas, and lower background sounds that are not dialogue. It works without typical

dynamics processor “pumping” (compression/limiting) or other obvious side effects, and produces

results similar to detailed manual clip gain adjustments or by carefully “riding” the track with fader

automation. Dialogue Leveler can often “fix and mix” a recording with a single boom mic where one

character is closer than another or turns away from the mic at times, and level it out so that the original

relative dynamics are preserved while increasing intelligibility and average level.

Dialogue Leveler can be used on track audio in real time but not on live audio input. Dialogue Leveler

can be used on any mono or stereo (or multi-mono) audio track, but it is not supported on greater-

than-stereo tracks.

Dialogue Leveler has the following controls:

�Dialogue Leveler: Enables or disables Dialogue Leveler processing.

�Waveform Processing display: Shows a scrolling waveform display and indicates Dialogue Leveler

processing with a gray line. However, note that the display does not appear in the version of

Dialogue Leveler for clip-based processing.

�Preset Menu: The preset menu provides the following options:

Allow wider dynamics: This is the default, and is best for sources with wider ranging dynamic

levels from loud-to-soft, and where the clip levels are medium to high.

More lift for low levels: Select this option if the source has more low level dialogue that you want

to boost.

Lift soft whispery sources: Select this option if the source has whispered dialogue and

background noise.

Optimize moderate levels: Select this option if the source is at medium levels throughout.

�Reduce Loud Dialogue: When enabled, louder dialogue is ridden downward on peaks and acts

somewhat like a “perfect limiter” where you don’t have to adjust threshold or time constants.

Due to the “near real time” aspect, analysis occurs prior to audible playback for optimal results.

�Lift Soft Dialogue: When enabled, finds low level dialogue and lifts and evens out material that

is more variable in level and softer, but because the process is dialogue focused, it doesn’t tend

to raise background sounds (unless they are happening at the same time as the dialogue itself).

More often than not, the Lift Soft Dialogue option is the most useful of the three options, as it

makes less audible lines of dialogue more audible and naturally smooth, while not boosting

background noise.

�Background Reduction: When enabled, reduces background sounds by focusing on dialogue and

gently removing them based on the internal presets (Preset menu).

�Output Gain: Adjust the Output Gain by clicking and dragging on the Output Gain control or

by entering a value in the numeric field (Output Gain control in dB with 0 to +6 dB range with

.1dB resolution).
