# Mandelbrot [MAN]

The Mandelbrot node

Mandelbrot Node Introduction

This node creates an image pattern based on the Mandelbrot fractal theory set.

Inputs

The one input on the Mandelbrot node is for an effect mask to limit the area where the fractal noise

is applied.

Effect Mask: The optional blue effect mask input accepts a mask shape created by polylines, basic

primitive shapes, paint strokes, or bitmaps from other tools. Connecting a mask to this input limits the

fractals to only those pixels within the mask.

Basic Node Setup

The Mandelbrot node generates images that can be used for motion graphics and sci-fi effects. Below,

it is used to generate motion graphics for the background of a title.

Inspector

Mandelbrot node controls

Noise Tab

The Noise tab controls the shape and pattern of the noise for the Mandelbrot node.

Position X and Y

This chooses the image’s horizontal and vertical position or seed point.

Zoom

Zoom magnifies the pattern in or out. Every magnification is recalculated so that there is no practical

limit to the zoom.

Escape Limit

Defines a point where the calculation of the iteration is aborted. Low values lead to blurry halos.

Iterations

This determines the repetitiveness of the set. When animated, it simulates a growing of the set.

Rotation

This rotates the pattern. Every new angle requires recalculation of the image.

The Mandelbrot node Color tab

Color Tab

The Color tab allows you to adjust the gradient and repetition of the gradient colors for the

generated pattern.

Grad Method

Use this control to determine the type of gradation applied at the borders of the pattern.

Continuous Potential

This causes the edges of the pattern to blend to the background color.

Iterations

This causes the edges of the pattern to be solid.

Gradient Curve

This affects the width of the gradation from the pattern to the background color.

R/G/B/A Phase and Repetitions

These controls set the color values of the pattern generators.

Common Controls

Image and Settings Tabs

The Image and Settings tabs in the Inspector are duplicated in other generator nodes. These common

controls are described in detail at the end of this chapter in “The Common Controls” section.

Plasma [PLAS]

The Plasma node

Plasma Node Introduction

The Plasma node is a background generation node that uses four circular patterns to generate images

similar to plasma. It is useful as a deforming pattern for the Shadow and Deform nodes and to create a

variety of other useful shapes and patterns. It is similar to the Fast Noise node.

Inputs

The one input on the Plasma node is for an effect mask to limit the area where the plasma pattern is applied.

Effect Mask: The optional blue effect mask input accepts a mask shape created by polylines, basic

primitive shapes, paint strokes, or bitmaps from other tools. Connecting a mask to this input limits the

plasma to only those pixels within the mask.

Basic Node Setup

Like the Mandelbrot node, the Plasma node generates images that can be used for motion graphics

and sci-fi effects. Below, it is used to generate motion graphics for the background of a title.

Circles Tab

The Circles tab controls the shape and pattern generated by the Plasma node.

Scale

The Scale control is used to adjust the size of the pattern created.

Operation

The options in this menu determine the mathematical relationship among the four circles whenever

they intersect.

Circle Type

Select the type of circle to be used.

Circle Center

Report and change the position of the circle center.

Circle Scale

Determines the size of the circle to be used for the pattern.

Plasma node Color tab

Color Tab

The Color tab allows you to adjust the colors and location within the pattern of the colors for the

generated plasma.

Phase

Phase changes the color phase of the entire image. When animated, this creates psychedelic

color cycles.

R/G/B/A Phases

Changes the phase of the individual color channels and the Alpha. When animated, this creates color

cycling effects.

Common Controls

Image and Settings Tabs

The Image and Settings tabs in the Inspector are duplicated in many Generator nodes. These common

controls are described in detail at the end of this chapter in “The Common Controls” section.
