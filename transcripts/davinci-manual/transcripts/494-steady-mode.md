# Steady Mode

In Steady mode, the Planar Tracker transforms the background plate to keep the pattern as motionless

as possible. Any leftover motion is because the Planar Tracker failed to follow the pattern accurately or

because the pattern did not belong to a physically planar surface.

Steady mode is not very useful for actual stabilization, but is useful for checking the quality of a track. If

the track is good, during playback the pattern should not move at all while the rest of the background

plate distorts around it. It can be helpful to zoom in on parts of the pattern and place the mouse cursor

over a feature and see how far that feature drifts away from the mouse cursor over time.

Steady Time

This is the time where the pattern’s position is snapshotted and frozen in place. It is most common to

set this to the reference frame.

Invert Steady Transform

This causes the Planar Tracker node to reverse the effects of the steady transform. This means two

Planar Tracker nodes connected back to back with the second set to invert should give back the

original image. If you place an effects node in between the two, then the effect will be locked in place.

This should only be used to accomplish effects that cannot be done through corner pinning, since it

involves two resamplings, causing softening of the background image.

Clipping Mode

Determines what happens to the parts of the background image that get moved off frame by the

steady transform:

�Domain: The off frame parts are kept.

�Frame: The off frames parts are thrown away.

Domain mode is useful when Steady mode is being used to “lock” an effect to the pattern.

As an example, consider painting on the license plate of a moving car. One way to do this is to

use a Planar Tracker node to steady the license plate, then a Paint node to paint on the license

plate, and then a second Planar Tracker to undo the steady transform. If the Clipping mode is

set to Domain, the off frame parts generated by the first Planar Tracker are preserved so that

the second Planar Tracker can, in turn, map them back into the frame.

Corner Pin Mode

In Corner Pin mode, one or more textures can be attached to a previously tracked planar surface and

undergo the same perspective distortions as the surface.

The corner pin workflow with Planar Tracker is:


Track: select a planar surface in the shot that you wish to attach a texture to or replace the texture

on. Track the shot (see the tracking workflow in the Track section).


Switch the Operation Mode to Corner Pin: When Corner Pin mode is entered from Track mode, the

pattern polygon is hidden and a corner pin control is shown in the viewer.


Connect in the texture: In the Node Editor, connect the output of the MediaIn node containing the

texture to the Corner Pin 1 input on the Planar Tracker node.


Adjust corner pin: Drag the corners of the corner pin in the viewer until the texture is positioned

correctly. Sometimes the Show Grid option is useful when positioning the texture. Additionally, if

it helps to position it more accurately, scrub to other times and make adjustments to the corner pin.


Review: Play back the footage and make sure the texture “sticks” to the planar surface.

Merge Mode

Controls how the foreground (the corner pinned texture) is merged over the background (the tracked

footage). If there are multiple corner pins, this option is shared by all of them. There are four options to

pick from:

�BG only

�FG only

�FG over BG

�BG over FG

Number of Corner Pins

Use the + and - buttons to increase or decrease the number of corner pins. Each time an additional

corner pin is created, a corresponding input appears on the node in the Node Editor.

Corner Pin 1 Input Group

Each corner pin has a group of related inputs:

�Enable: Controls the visibility of the corner pin in the viewer.

�Show Grid: Shows a grid over the corner pin. This can be useful when positioning the corners.

�Merge Options: Controls merging of corner pin texture over the background. (See the

documentation for the Merge node.)

�Reference Time Positions: The positions of the four corners at the reference time. If the track was

not perfect, these positions can be animated to make adjustments on top of the track.

Stabilize Mode

Stabilize mode is used to smooth out shakiness in the camera by applying a transform that partially

counteracts the camera shake. This stabilizing transform (contained in the Stable Track spline) is

computed by comparing neighboring frames.

NOTE: Stabilize mode only smooths out motions, while Steady mode tries to completely “lock

off” all motion.

Be aware that the Planar Tracker stabilizes based on the motion of the pattern, so it is essential to

choose the pattern carefully. If the motion of the pattern does not represent the motion of the camera,

then there may be unexpected results. For example, if tracking the side of a moving truck and the

camera is moving alongside it, the Planar Tracker smooths the combined motion of both the truck

and the mounted camera. In some cases, this is not the desired effect. It may be better to choose

the pattern to be on some fixed object like the road or the side of a building, which would result in

smoothing only the motion of the camera.

One unavoidable side effect of the stabilization process is that transparent edges appear along the

edges of the image. These edges appear because the stabilizer does not have any information about

what lies off frame, so it cannot fill in the missing bits. The Planar Tracker node offers the option to

either crop or zoom away these edges. When filming, if the need for post-production stabilization is

anticipated, it can sometimes be useful to film at a higher resolution (or lower zoom).

The Planar Tracker Stabilization Workflow


Track: Select a roughly planar region that represents the motion that you want to stabilize.

Track the shot (see the tracking workflow in the Track section).


Switch the Operation Mode to Stabilize: Until a stabilization is computed, the Planar Tracker will

just output the input footage.


Adjust stabilization options: Frequently changed options are Parameters to Smooth and

Smoothing Radius.


Compute stabilization: Press the Compute Stabilization button and wait for the stabilization

computations to finish. Play back the output of the Planar Tracker node to see the effects of the

stabilization. Notice that transparent edges have been introduced around the edges of the image

by the stabilization transform.


Refine: Adjust the stabilization options and recompute the stabilization as many times as desired.


Handle transparent edges (optional): Set the Frame Mode to either Zoom or Crop as desired

and then click the Auto Zoom or Auto Crop button. Play back the footage to observe the

effects. If there is too much zoom or the image has been cropped too small, try reducing the

amount of smoothing.

Parameters to Smooth

Specify which of the following parameters to smooth:

�X Translation

�Y Translation

�Rotation

�Scale

Smoothing Window

When stabilizing a particular frame, this determines how the contributions of neighboring frames are

weighted. Available choices are Box and Gaussian.

Smoothing Radius (Frames)

Determines the number of frames whose transforms are averaged together to compute the stabilization.

A larger Smoothing Radius results in more smoothing but introduces more transparent edges.

Compute Stabilization

Clicking this button runs the stabilizer, overwriting the results of any previous stabilization. As soon as

the stabilization is finished, the output of the Planar Tracker node will be immediately updated with the

stabilization applied.

NOTE: The stabilizer uses the Track spline (created by the tracker) to produce the Stable

Track spline. Both of these splines’ keyframes contain 4 x 4 matrices, and the keyframes are

editable in the Spline Editor.

Clipping Mode

Determines what happens to the parts of the background image that get moved off frame by the

stabilization:

�Domain: The off frame parts are kept.

�Frame: The off frames parts are thrown away.

Frame Mode

This controls how transparent edges are handled. The available options include:

�Full: Do nothing. Leaves the transparent edges as is.

�Crop: Crops away the transparent edges. When this option is selected, the size of Planar Tracker’s

output image is smaller than the input image. No image resamplings occur. In Crop mode, use the Auto

Crop button or manually adjust the crop window by changing the X Offset, Y Offset, and Scale sliders.

Auto Crop Button: When this button is clicked, the Planar Tracker will examine all the frames and

pick the largest possible crop window that removes all the transparent edges. The computed crop

window will always be centered in frame and pixel aligned. When clicked, Auto Crop updates the

X/Y Offset and Scale sliders.

�Zoom: Scales the image bigger until the transparent edges are off frame. Choosing this option

causes an image resampling to occur. The downside of this approach is that it reduces the quality

(slightly softens) of the output image. In Zoom mode, use the Auto Zoom button or manually adjust

the zoom window by changing the X Offset, Y Offset, and Scale sliders.

Auto Zoom: When this button is clicked, the Planar Tracker will examine all the frames and pick

the smallest possible zoom factor that removes all the transparent edges. The computed zoom

window will always be centered in frame. When clicked, Auto Zoom updates the X/Y Offset and

Scale sliders.

Right-Click Here for Stable Track Spline

Right-clicking over this label provides access to a spline whose keyframes contain 4 x 4 matrices

which in turn represent the stabilization transforms. This is mostly here for completeness and for

advanced users.

Options Tab

These controls affect the look of onscreen controls in the viewer.

The Planar Tracker Options tab

Darken Image

Darkens the image while in Track mode in order to better see the controls and tracks in the viewer.

The Shift+D keyboard shortcut toggles this.

Show Track Markers

Toggles the display of the dots marking the location of trackers at the current time.

Show Trails

Toggles the display of the trails following the location of trackers.

Trail Length

Allows changing the length of tracker trails. If the pattern is moving very slowly, increasing the length

can sometimes make the trails easier to follow in the viewer. If the pattern is moving very fast, the

tracks can look like spaghetti in the viewer. Decreasing the length can help.

Inlier/Outlier Colors

When tracking, the tracker analyzes the frame and detects which of the multitudinous tracks belong to

the dominant motion and which ones represent anomalous, unexplainable motion. By default, tracks

belonging to the dominant motion are colored green (and are called inliers) and those that do not

belong are colored red (and are called outliers). Only the inlier tracks are used when computing the

final resulting track.

Common Controls

Settings Tab

The Settings tab in the Inspector is also duplicated in other Tracking nodes. These common controls

are described in detail at the end of this chapter in “The Common Controls” section.

Surface Tracker [SFt]

The Surface Tracker node

Surface Tracker Node Introduction

The Surface Tracker is used for applying textures and effects to flexible or deformable moving

surfaces, like cloth and skin. The Surface Tracker ensures that the folding and deforming of the texture

or effect is realistically matched to the folding and deforming of the surface that it is attached to in

the image.

The Surface tracker is a complex effect, with many different options and controls to create the most

realistic composites possible. But in all cases you simply move from left to right, using the buttons in

the effect’s settings.


Click the Bounds button, and click on the screen to define the area on the surface where you

wish to apply the new texture. The bounds should select one surface at a time and not go over/on

object edges.


Click on the Mesh button to define the control points along the natural folds and curves of the

surface within the bounds.


Click on the Track button to analyze the motion of the surface over time, using the mesh

you just set.


Click on the Result button to composite the texture on top of the moving mesh.

Across all the tabs in the Surface Tracker, the Tracked Range shows the start and end frame numbers

of your clip that contain tracking data. Any existing tracking data will be reset if you modify the bounds,

or mesh layout, and you will need to re-track it.
