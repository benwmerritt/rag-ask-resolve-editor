# Viewing Selective Channels

When compositing, you often deal with individual color components or channels in an image as much

as you deal with the full RGB color of the entire image. The viewers and subviews can display the

isolated color, alpha, depth channels, and even auxiliary channels that make up the image.

Viewing Color Channels

The default view is the full RGB color channel, but to change the channel that is displayed you can use

the Channel toolbar button, the viewer’s contextual menu, or keyboard shortcuts.

To toggle between RGB and alpha channels in the active viewer:

�Click the Color button in the viewer toolbar to toggle between full RGB color and that image’s

alpha channel.

To toggle the channel that’s displayed in the active viewer:

�Click the arrow to the right of the Color button to choose a specific channel to view from the list of

available channels in the current image.

�Click the viewer you want to toggle, and press one of the following keyboard shortcuts;

C - Full RGB color display

R - Display red channel

G - Display green channel

B - Display blue channel

A - Display alpha channel

Z - Display Z-buffer channel

Viewing Auxiliary Channels

The viewers support RGBA and Z channels using keyboard shortcuts, but they support other channels

as well. File formats such as OpenEXR often include auxiliary image data that provide more control

and compositing options when working with rendered 3D images. To view auxiliary image data in a

viewer, click the arrow to the right of the RGB button to display the drop-down menu or right-click in

the viewer and choose an option from the Channels submenu of the contextual menu.

Viewing Multilayer Files

(Studio Version Only)

Fusion can intelligently handle multilayer image workflows with support for EXR, Stereoscopic 3D,

and PSD assets. Users can see a list of layers on the Fusion viewers and interact with layers in each

node in the Settings tab in the Inspector. As this layer structure is retained throughout the toolset,

this means you can isolate a tool to work on an individual layer, while still passing through the other

layers unmodified.

Viewer

When loading a multilayer file, you can preview specific layers in the Viewer and selecting a

layer from the drop-down list. Files without layer support will show only a ‘default’ option from the

drop-down menu.

The 3D Viewer

Building a composite in 3D space has different requirements from traditional 2D compositing.

When a node from the 3D category or some particle systems is selected, a 3D Viewer is used to

display the scene. The 3D Viewer shows a representation of a composite in a true GPU-accelerated

3D environment.

For more information on 3D controls, see Chapter 85, “3D Compositing Basics,” in the

DaVinci Resolve Reference Manual or Chapter 25 in the Fusion Reference Manual.

Panning, Scaling, and Rotating a 3D Viewer

For the most part, navigation in the 3D Viewer is similar to the navigation in the 2D Viewer. Panning

and zooming work with the same controls even though you’re moving within a 3D space. However,

when viewing a 3D scene, panning changes the point of view and thus the center point for scaling and

rotation, too. A combination of panning and rotation will allow you to move the point of view anywhere

in the scene.

Another small change is that there’s a lower limit to the scale of a 3D scene. Continuing to zoom in

past this limit will instead move (“dolly“) the point of view forward. The mouse wheel will move forward

slowly, and the keyboard will move more quickly.

Critically, the 3D Viewer gives you additional control to rotate the viewer within the three dimensions

of the scene to better see your scene from different angles as you work.

To rotate within a 3D Viewer, do one of the following:

�Hold down the Option key and drag left or right using the middle mouse button.

�Hold down the middle and right mouse buttons while dragging.

The rotation is centered on the middle of the view.

TIP: These rotation controls can be used with the 3D Histogram subview as well.

Viewing Objects via Wireframe

3D composites not only work with 2D images on image planes but can also integrate true geometry,

such as that generated by the Particle system, Text 3D node, imported FBX meshes, and basic

primitives from the 3D toolset. Using a Wireframe view helps to see through a mesh or see the density

of the geometry. It is much easier to see a change in the Subdivision level of an ImagePlane3D in

wireframe than viewing the rendered image.

To display 3D geometry in wireframe, do the following:

�Right-click the 3D Viewer and choose 3D Options > Wireframe from the contextual menu.

Changing the POV of a 3D Viewer

Compositing a 3D scene often requires that you view the scene from different angles to make sure the

position and animation are what you want. While the 3D Viewer uses a perspective camera that allows

you to look at the 3D scene from any angle, you can also switch the 3D Viewer to view from the front,

top, left, or right side of the scene; these are collectively called Orthographic views.

Additionally, if you have a camera or spotlight in your scene, you can switch the viewer to face the

scene from the point of view of those objects.

To change the 3D viewpoints:

Right-click the viewer and choose an option from the Camera submenu of the contextual

menu. The choices include Perspective, Front, Top, Left, and Right.

Changing Cameras in a 3D Viewer

If you have one or more camera objects in the 3D scene, they will be listed as options in the contextual

menu. Spotlights and other lights or objects in the scene will be listed in the Other submenu. If you

choose any one of these objects, the 3D Viewer jumps to display the scene from the point of view of

the chosen object. While looking “through“ an object, rotating, panning, or zooming, the viewer will

instead change the rotation, position, and scale of the camera, light, or other object.

Copying a Viewer’s POV to a Camera

There are many times you will have used the default perspective view to set up your scene and then

want that point of view (POV) to become your main camera’s point of view. You can easily position and

orient a camera, light, or other object to match the current point of view shown in the viewer using the

Copy PoV To command.

To copy the point of view in the viewer to a camera, do the following:


Set up a 3D Viewer with the point of view you want by zooming, panning, and rotating the viewer.


Add a camera to your 3D scene.


Right-click anywhere within the 3D Viewer and choose Camera > Copy PoV To >

Camera3DNameOfCamera from the contextual menu.

The Camera3D’s controls will inherit the viewer’s position and angle values.

TIP: The Copy PoV To command uses the object’s own coordinate space; any

transformations performed downstream by another node are not taken into account.

POV Labels

As you switch the POV of the viewer, you can keep track of which POV is currently displayed via a text

label at the bottom-left corner of the viewer. Right-clicking directly on this label, or on the axis control

above it, acts as a shortcut to the Camera submenu, allowing you to easily choose another viewpoint.
