# Organizations

Blackmagic Cloud allows you to create an Organization account, which helps consolidate storage,

permissions, licensing, and billing in one interface. An organization is the best way to manage small

or large enterprises with multiple users. You can control which members of your organization have

access to which project libraries, group members together in specific roles or by project, and control

your storage and DaVinci Resolve licenses.

Creating an Organization Account

Before you create an organization account, you need to create a personal account on the Blackmagic

Cloud website. This user is the default owner of the organization, though you can add more owners

and manage them later.

Once you have a personal account, sign in and click on the Organizations icon. You will be

presented with a simple sign up window.

The Create Organization window

In this window, you can type in your organization’s name and the country you are resident in

for billing purposes.

Home

This tab presents a dashboard and overview of services purchased by your Organization; clicking on

any pane will take you to that section of the website.

The Home tab will give you a simple dashboard showing your Organization’s current services.

Members

This tab will let you add or remove members for your organization. Members are sent invitations via

email and are required to have or sign up for a Blackmagic Cloud account.

The Members tab lets you add and remove members from your organization.

The Members tab, by default, shows the Active members of a project. You can also click on Pending to

see invited users that haven’t accepted yet, and resend that invitation to join, or rescind it all together.

To the right are the search and sort tools to let you easily find members in large organizations.

Only members with Owner permissions can add or remove members from an organization.

To Add a Member to an Organization:


In the Members tab of the Organization, click on the Add Members button in the upper right.


In the Add Members dialog box, enter an email address, or multiple email addresses to invite

several members at the same time.


When you’ve finished, click the Add Members button to send the invite emails to all users

in the box.

To Remove a Member from an Organization:


In the Active Members, click on the 3-dot option menu next to the user you wish to remove.


Select Remove Member from the option menu.


In the Remove Member warning that appears, click on the Remove button.

While you can send multiple member invitations at once, removing members currently requires

you to do it one member at a time.

TIP: You can add individual members to existing groups using Add to Group in the

option menu.

Groups

The Groups tab allows you to further organize your members, by combining them into specific

roles, projects, or any criteria that works for your organization. This allows you to quickly assign all

members in a group to a Project Library, or to activate any licenses of DaVinci Resolve Studio that your

organization has purchased.

The Groups tab lets you organize members into user-defined groups.

The Groups tab, by default, shows the currently active Groups. For the example above, we have

created an organization for a fictional travel show. We have created two groups, one called

Cinematographers so that the members can automatically upload footage from the field into their

assigned projects. The second we called editors, who not only need access to that footage but

license keys for DaVinci Resolve Studio that the organization has purchased. Only members with

Owner permissions can add or remove members from a group, and members can be assigned to

multiple groups.

Project Servers

The Project Servers tab lets you see your current cloud project libraries, buy more, or delete unused

libraries for your organization. As a reminder, each project library can hold multiple projects, so

you don’t necessarily need a new project library for each individual episode, video project, or film.

Members and Groups, however, are assigned at the project library level, so they can see and modify

all projects inside that library. So you may want separate project libraries for things like different

clients, social media channels, or shows.
