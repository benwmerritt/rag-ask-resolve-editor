# The Cut Page

The Cut page is a focused environment for fast editing. It’s useful in situations where you need

to quickly cut a news segment, build an episode of web content, edit a straightforward program,

experiment with multiple arrangements of a scene, or put together a first assembly edit.

The Cut page is also a good introductory editing interface for people who are new to editing, as it

presents a streamlined set of tools that are fast to learn and simple to use. Whatever your background,

you’ll find the Cut page to be a valuable addition to your editing experience in DaVinci Resolve.

The default workspace of the Cut page consists of the Media Pool, a single Viewer, and the Timeline

area. These three regions let you quickly import and organize clips, edit clips, and even export the

result, all from within the Cut page.

For more information on the Cut page, see Chapter 26, “Using the Cut Page.”

The Media Pool

The Media Pool appears in the Cut page as well, and contains all video clips, audio clips, graphics,

and other media that you import into your project. You can create Bins with which to organize all of this

media, to make it easier to find what you need quickly. These bins are opened via the bin drop-down

at the upper left-hand corner.

Each piece of media you import, whether it’s video, audio, or graphics, appears as an individual clip,

and they can be selected, scrubbed for fast viewing, reorganized into bins, opened into the Viewer for

playback, or edited into a timeline using the edit buttons or via drag and drop.

Owing to the Cut page’s mission to make editing faster, the Media Pool has different options for

viewing (such as the Strip view) and customizing.

The Strip View mode

The Viewer

The Viewer lets you see clips from the Media Pool or clips in the Timeline play, and has numerous

controls to control what you see and how things play.

The single Viewer in the Cut page

The Viewer has four mode options. Which option is currently in use can be seen, and switched, by four

buttons in the upper left-hand corner of the Viewer.

The Different options are entered automatically by various actions (from left to right):

�You can double-click any clip to open it into the Viewer as a Source Clip.

�You can view an entire bin full of clips in the Source Tape.

�You can play your edited program in the Timeline.

�You can see all of your synced material at the same time in the Multi Source Viewer.

Clicking the Tools button in the lower left of the Viewer reveals an effects toolbar that you can use

to add and edit clip effects, right within the Viewer with no Inspector needed. The Tools button

reveals a variety of controls over sizing, cropping, audio, speed effects, stabilization, dynamic zoom,

and compositing.

The Tools bar shown opened

Audio Meter

An audio meter to the right of the Viewer shows you a graphical representation of the audio levels

playing in the current clip or in the Timeline as you play through the Viewer, via animated vertical bars

that are tinted to indicate how loud the levels are.

The Timeline

The word “timeline” refers both to an edited sequence of clips which constitutes a program that is

stored in the Media Pool, and to the area of the Cut page interface where you can open this sequence

of clips to see its contents, and for playback and editing.

For the Cut page user, the timeline is divided into an Upper Timeline at the top, and a larger and more

detailed Timeline Editor showing a zoomed in portion of the timeline around the playhead at the

bottom. Working together, these two views of your edited sequence make it possible to navigate your

entire project and cut in great detail.

The Timeline of the Cut page, comprising the Upper Timeline and the zoomed in Lower Timeline

Three icons at the upper left-hand corner of the Timeline lets you choose a variety of timeline tasks.

They are composed of Timeline Options, Timeline Actions, and Edit Actions.

The Timeline is divided into multiple tracks, with each track capable of holding a sequence of clips in

order to create a program. The main tracks, which are labeled numerically, combine a clip’s video and

audio into a single item in the Timeline, for simplicity. Editing the In or Out point of a clip edits the video

and audio together.

TIP: In the Edit page, Video+Audio clips are presented as separated Video and Audio items

on different tracks. When you open the Fairlight page, audio is presented on tracks with

lanes, where each audio channel can be seen. In this way, each page gives you different sets

of controls over the contents of the timeline that are appropriate for each page.

The Edit Page

The Edit page exposes a source-record style NLE that incorporates many specialized features for both

creative editing and finishing. The Edit page is divided into three main regions: the browsers found at

the left, the Viewers at the top, and the Timeline at the bottom, all of which work together to let you

import, edit, and trim timelines with a flexible variety of tools and methods.

The Media Pool

As with everywhere else it appears in DaVinci Resolve, the Media Pool lets you organize and peruse

all of the media and timelines in a project. DaVinci Resolve projects may contain one or more edited

timelines (sometimes called a sequence in other applications).

The Media Pool in the Edit page is identical to that shown on the Media, Fusion, Color, and Fairlight

pages, and shows you all of the source clips and timelines that are available for editing. A Bin list at the

left shows a hierarchical list of folders that you can use to organize your media.

By default, the Media Pool has a single bin, named “Master,” but you can add more bins as necessary

to organize your clips, opening any of them to expose their contents with a single click. The Bin list can

be hidden or shown via the button at the upper-left of the Media Pool. A browser to the right shows

the contents of the currently selected bin.

Effects Library Browsing

The Effects Library contains a folder with the different Video Transitions, Title Effects, Generators, and

Filters that are available for editing in the Timeline. The Effects Library has two panels, a Toolbox panel

that contains the default Transitions, Titles, and Generators that Resolve comes with, and an OpenFX

panel that contains any OpenFX transitions and generators you might have installed on your system.
