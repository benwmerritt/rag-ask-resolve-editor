# Text 3D Modifiers

Right-clicking within the Styled Text box displays a menu with the following text modifiers. Only one

modifier can be applied to a Text 3D Styled Text box. Below is a brief list of the text specific modifiers.

For more information see Chapter 124, “Modifiers,” in the DaVinci Resolve Reference Manual

or Chapter 64 in the Fusion Reference Manual.

Animate

Use the Animate command to set to a keyframe on the entered text and animate the content over time.

Character Level Styling

The Text 3D node doesn’t support Character Level Styling directly. However, you can create a Text+

node first and modify its text field with a Character Level Styling modifier. Then either connect the Text

3D’s text field to the modifier that is now available or copy the Text+ node and paste its settings to the

Text 3D node (right-click > Paste Settings)

Comp Name

Comp Name puts the name of the composition in the Styled Text box and is generally used as a quick

way to create slates.

Follower

Follower is a text modifier that can be used to ripple animation applied to the text across each

character in the text. See “Text Modifiers” at the end of this chapter.

Publish

Publish the text for connection to other text nodes.

Text Scramble

A text modifier ID is used to randomize the characters in the text. See “Text Modifiers” at the end of

this chapter.

Text Timer

A text modifier is used to count down from a specified time or to output the current date and time.

See “Text Modifiers” at the end of this chapter.

Time Code

A text modifier is used to output Time Code for the current frame. See “Text Modifiers” at the end of

this chapter.

Connect To

Use this option to connect the text generated by this Text node to the published output of

another node.

Transform 3D [3Xf]

The Transform 3D node

Transform 3D Node Introduction

The Transform 3D node can be used to translate, rotate, or scale all the elements within a scene

without requiring a Merge 3D node. This can be useful for hierarchical transformations or for offsetting

objects that are merged into a scene multiple times. Its controls are identical to those found in other

3D nodes’ Transformation tabs.

Inputs

The Transform node has a single required input for a 3D scene or 3D object.

Scene Input: The orange scene input is connected to a 3D scene or 3D object to apply a second set

of transformation controls.

Basic Node Setup

The Transform 3D node adds 3D position, rotation, and pivot control onto any existing transforms in

the 3D node prior to it. You can combine multiple Transform 3D nodes together to build parenting or

hierarchical movement.

Inspector

Transform 3D controls

Controls Tab

The Controls tab is the primary tab for the Transform 3D node. It includes controls to translate, rotate,

or scale all elements within a scene without requiring a Merge 3D node.

Translation

�X, Y, Z Offset: Controls are used to position the 3D element in 3D space.

Rotation

�Rotation Order: Use these buttons to select the order used to apply the rotation along each axis

of the object. For example, XYZ would apply the rotation to the X-axis first, followed by the Y-axis,

and then the Z-axis.

�X, Y, Z Rotation: Use these controls to rotate the object around its pivot point. If the Use Target

checkbox is selected, then the rotation is relative to the position of the target; otherwise, the

global axis is used.

Pivot Controls

�X, Y, Z Pivot: A pivot point is the point around which an object rotates. Normally, an object rotates

around its own center, which is considered to be a pivot of 0,0,0. These controls can be used to

offset the pivot from the center.

Scale

�X, Y, Z Scale: If the Lock X/Y/Z checkbox is checked, a single scale slider is shown. This adjusts

the overall size of the object. If the Lock checkbox is unchecked, individual X, Y, and Z sliders are

displayed to allow scaling in any dimension.

NOTE: If the Lock checkbox is checked, scaling of individual dimensions is not possible,

even when dragging specific axes of the Transformation widget in Scale mode.

Use Target

Selecting the Use Target checkbox enables a set of controls for positioning an XYZ target. When Use

Target is enabled, the object always rotates to face the target. The rotation of the object becomes

relative to the target.

Import Transform

Opens a file browser where you can select a scene file saved or exported by your 3D application.

It supports the following file types:

LightWave Scene

.lws

Max Scene

.ase

Maya Ascii Scene

.ma

dotXSI

.xsi

The Import Transform button imports only transformation data. For 3D geometry, lights and cameras,

consider using the File > FBX Import option from the menus.

Import Transform Browser

Onscreen Transformation Controls

Onscreen Transformation controls provide an alternative way of using the controls in the Inspector.

The viewer includes modes for transformation, rotation, and scaling. To change the mode of the

onscreen controls, select one of the three buttons in the toolbar along the side of the viewer.

The modes can also be toggled using the keyboard shortcut Q for translation, W for rotation, and E

for scaling. In all three modes, an individual axis of the control may be dragged to affect just that axis,

or the center of the control may be dragged to affect all three axes.

The scale sliders for most 3D nodes default to locked, which causes uniform scaling of all three axes.

Unlock the Lock X/Y/Z Scale checkbox to scale an object on a single axis only.

Triangulate 3D [3Tri]

The Triangulate 3D node

Triangulate 3D Node Introduction

The Triangulate 3D node is a unique node in that it has no controls. This node turns polygon shapes

into triangles. For instance, a quad that is four points becomes two triangles. It is used to convert

complex polygon shapes into a mesh for easier processing.

Inputs

The Triangulate 3D node has a single required input for a 3D scene or 3D object.

Scene Input: The orange scene input is connected to the 3D scene or 3D object you

want to triangulate.

Basic Node Setup

The Triangulate 3D node is placed after the geometry you want to triangulate.

Common Controls

Settings Tab

The Settings tab in the Inspector is duplicated in other 3D nodes. These common controls are

described in detail at the end of this chapter in “The Common Controls” section.
