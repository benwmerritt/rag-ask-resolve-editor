# The Monitoring Panel

The Monitoring panel shows all of the audio meters corresponding to the tracks in the Timeline, as well

as the Master Output meter, Control Room meters, and a video viewer.

The Monitoring panel

At left, a row of audio meters corresponds to the channel strips of the Mixer, one meter for every audio

track in the Timeline. To the right of these, all buses appear, showing you meters for the Mains and

Subs (submixes) you’re using to mix down your show. Farther to the right of these, a set of Control

Room meters show you the monitored output and loudness meters for a precise analysis of your mix’s

perceived loudness.

Finally, a small viewer to the right of the Monitoring panel shows the frame of video at the position of

the playhead. This viewer can be undocked via a button at the lower right-hand corner.

Floating Timecode Window

A timecode window is available from the Workspace menu on every page, including the Fairlight page.

Choosing this option displays a floating timecode window that shows the timecode of the Viewer

or Timeline that currently has focus. This window is resizable so you can make the timecode larger

or smaller.

The Deliver Page

Once you’ve finished grading your project, you need to either render it, or output it to tape to deliver it

to your client. This is where the Deliver page comes in. The Deliver page can be used both to output

digital deliverables, or to output tape, depending on which mode you enable. Either way, the Deliver

page is divided into five areas of functionality, each of which lets you set up a different part of a render

or output to tape.

The Deliver page is set up to let you queue a series of individual jobs, each of which can have different

settings, or be set up to render different parts of the Timeline. In this way, you can output multiple

deliverables, or re-render multiple areas of a timeline, as your needs require.

The Render Settings List

The Render Settings list contains the customizable settings that affect how media is rendered out of

DaVinci Resolve.

These settings are covered in more detail later in “Output Scaling.” The Render Settings you can

choose from for outputting from DaVinci Resolve appear in three panels, separating the Video, Audio,

and File information-based settings in a logical fashion. By default, this list shows only the most

important criteria necessary for defining a render. However, additional controls can be exposed by

clicking the “Advanced settings” disclosure triangle at the bottom of each group of settings.

The Deliver Page Timeline

The Timeline mirrors the Timeline seen in the Color page. You can use the Timeline in the Deliver

page to turn off tracks with clips you don’t want to include in the operation, define the range of clips

you want to render or output to tape, and to choose which versions for each clip you want to output.

You also have the option of switching the Deliver page Timeline to look like the Color page Timeline

instead, if that’s what you’re more comfortable with.

The Deliver page’s Thumbnail and Mini-Timeline match the Color page

The Deliver page Timeline also has the Timeline Filter drop-down at the right-hand side of the toolbar.

Using this drop-down to filter the contents of the Timeline lets you restrict the range of media you

want to output in different ways. For example, if you’ve already rendered a timeline, but you’ve since

made some changes, you can use the “Show Modified Clips” option to display only the clips that have

changed within a particular timeframe. Another possibility is to choose the “Show Unrendered Clips”

option to show all clips that have not yet been rendered.

The Viewer

When rendering file-based media, the Viewer shows you exactly how the media being output will

look using the current settings, and the transport controls move the playhead throughout the current

Timeline. Audio levels can be adjusted by right-clicking on the speaker icon,and dragging the slider.

When outputting to tape, the Viewer shows you the tape output so you can set up insert or assembly

edit points, and the transport controls move the tape in the deck if device control is enabled. You

can also put the Viewer into Cinema Viewer mode by choosing Workspace > Viewer Mode > Cinema

Viewer (Command-F), so that it fills the entire screen. This command toggles Cinema Viewer mode

on and off.

The Render Queue

The Render Queue is a list of all the jobs you’ve queued up for file-based rendering. Each job can

have an individualized range of clips and render settings, which you can use to render multiple

sections or clips of a timeline, the same timeline output to multiple formats, or multiple timelines.

The Render Queue also has the option to show either just the jobs within the current project, or jobs

queued up and saved within all projects for the current user.
