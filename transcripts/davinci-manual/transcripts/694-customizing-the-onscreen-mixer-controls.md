# Customizing the Onscreen Mixer Controls

The 3 dot Option menu at the upper right-hand corner of the Mixer provides several different options

for customizing the appearance of the Mixer, as well as which controls are shown or hidden:

�Full Track Mixer or Small Track Mixer option: While the Full Track Mixer provides more room for

buttons and controls that are large enough you don’t have to squint to see them, the Small Track

Mixer allows many more channel strips to be seen at one time.

�Show Labels option: These are the sectional names for functional areas of the Mixer that appear

at the far left of the Mixer channel strip area. If you’re first getting started, these labels are useful,

but once you’ve gotten used to the Mixer’s layout, hiding the labels can give you a bit more room

to work with for another channel strip or two.

�Channel Strip Control Visibility options: Allows controls to be shown or hidden in the Mixer.

You can hide controls you know you’re not going to be using, no longer need to adjust, or wish to

not disturb.

Selecting Channel Strips and Tracks

When you select a track in the Timeline, you also select that track’s accompanying Mixer channel strip,

and vice versa:

�To select single tracks, just click.

�To select multiple contiguous tracks, select a starting track or channel strip, hold down Shift, and

click on last item you want in your selection.

�You can also select multiple channel strips in the Mixer by clicking and dragging to create a

bounding box around the tracks you want to select.

�To select non-adjacent (discontiguous) tracks or channel strips, command-click on each item you

want to add to your selection.

Selecting multiple channel strips selects the same tracks in the Timeline

Track Organization

Each channel strip has three organizational properties that let you keep track of which channel strip is

responsible for which part of the mix.

Track color: Each track can be differently color coded to help you keep organized.

These colors appear in the Timeline track header, the Mixer, and the meters to help you keep

track of which track corresponds to which channel strip and meter.

The track color and track number appear

at the top of each channel strip.

Track number: The number of the timeline audio track corresponding to each channel strip

appears here.

Track name: This mirrors the track name found in the track header of a track on the Timeline.

If you customize an audio track’s name in the Timeline or in the Mixer, that name appears here.

Each track’s name appears between the

assignment buttons and the arm/solo/mute buttons

Rearranging Tracks

You can reposition your tracks and busses in the Mixer by clicking and holding the track name and

dragging left or right to the desired location. This works for both individual and selection of multiple

channel strips.

As you move your mouse, a white line will appear indicating the new location and the change will be

reflected in the Index.

Disabling Tracks

You can disable an audio track in the Mixer by right-clicking the track number at the top of the

corresponding channel strip and choosing Disable Track from the contextual menu. Repeating these

steps will re-enable the track.

To simultaneously disable multiple tracks, select them, Option right-click any track number in the

group, and choose Disable Tracks from the contextual menu.

Managing Channel Strips Using the Index

The Index is a consolidated list view of all the tracks in the current Timeline, designed to make it easier

to manage timelines with lots of tracks. Columns let you see each track’s visibility, track number, name,

controls, channel format, monitor assignment (if any), ADC controls, and VCA assignment. The controls

in these columns let you manage the tracks in the current Timeline by showing or hiding them, toggling

track controls, or rearranging them. You can also right-click on one or more selected tracks to color

code them, or change the track type.

The Tracks panel of the Index shows all tracks

on both the Timeline and the Mixer.

Showing and Hiding Tracks

You can use the Tracks panel of the Index to hide tracks you don’t need to work on in order to create

more room for tracks you need to see.

TIP: To quickly show or hide a number of tracks, click and drag up or down over the eyeball

button of each track where you want to toggle the visibility.

Color Coding Tracks

Select one or more tracks, then right click one of the selected tracks and choose a color from the

Change Track Color submenu of the contextual menu.

Toggling Lock, Record, Solo, and Mute

As with visibility, you can use the Lock, Record, Solo, and Mute controls to quickly enable or disable

multiple tracks by clicking and dragging up or down over the Lock, R, S, or M buttons you want

to toggle.

Rearranging Tracks

You can rearrange tracks in the Tracks tab in the Index by clicking any track strip area between other

controls, and then dragging that track up or down in the Index. As you drag, a white line shows you

where that track will be inserted when you release it. You can even select a contiguous series of

tracks and drag them all to a new position in the Timeline at once.

Managing the Dividing Line

By default, there are two areas of tracks in the Index; one area is for audio tracks, and one area for

busses and VCAs with a dividing line separating them. Busses and VCAs can be dragged up out

of the divider and into any position for any order. This can be quite useful when having a series of

dialogue tracks, for instance, and pulling the dialogue bus up next to them.

The dividing line’s position can be moved to any location by dragging it, so you can keep the split

organization of tracks into two different areas but re-order what is shown.

Once the order has been changed in the Index, this is reflected in both the Mixer panel as well as

in the Meter panel. By reordering busses and tracks, you can adjust your workflow for whatever

set of tasks you are working on.

Single Mixer View

Clicking the three-dot Option menu at the top of the Mixer panel offers an option for Single Mixer

view. The Single Mixer view removes the divider line from the Tracks tab in the Index entirely,

providing a continuous scroll of the tracks, both in the Mixer panel horizontal scroll and the Index

vertical scroll. You can restore the divider at any time.

NOTE: You can reset the bus order to its original layout by choosing “Reset Bus Order” from

the three-dot Options menu on the upper right of the Mixer.

Changing Track Type

Track type refers to the channel width of the audio track and what format it is. The track type can be

changed at any time. For example, you could have a mono track and change it to a stereo, or 5.1 track,

or a 12 channel adaptive.

To change the track type, select one or more tracks, then right-click one of the selected tracks and

choose a different track type from the Change Track Type submenu of the contextual menu.

NOTE: Keep in mind that if you change from a larger track type to a smaller one, you may need to also

set which of the channels in the larger source audio file are now audible on the smaller track type. This

can be handled via the contextual menu choice Clip Attributes for a clip, using the Audio tab.

Deleting Tracks

You can delete an individual track by right-clicking it and choosing Delete Track from the

contextual menu.

To delete multiple selected tracks simultaneously, right-click any track within the collection and

choose Delete Tracks from the contextual menu.
