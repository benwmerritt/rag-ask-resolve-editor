# Selecting Clips in the Media Pool to Edit

Once you’ve found one or more clips that you want to use in your edit, you’ll need to make a selection

in preparation for performing an edit.

Methods of selecting clips in the Media Pool using the mouse:

�To select a single clip: Click a clip in the Media Pool.

�To select a contiguous range of clips: In either Metadata, Thumbnail, or List view, drag a selection

box over all the clips you want to select, or click to select the first clip in a series, then Shift-click

the last clip to select those clips and everything in between.

�To select a noncontiguous range of clips: Command-click each clip you want to include in

the selection. Or, you can hold the Command key down while you drag bounding boxes over

unselected clips to add them to the current selection, or over selected clips to remove them from

the selection.

Selecting a noncontiguous range of clips

Methods of selecting clips using the keyboard:

�To navigate the Bin list: Either click any bin in the Bin list to the left of the Media Pool, or press

Command-1 to make the Bin list the active pane of the Edit page, then use the Up and Down Arrow

keys to to move up and down among the available bins. Use the Right Arrow key to open a bin

that’s closed, and use the Left Arrow key to close the bin again.

�To select a single clip: Press Command-1 to make the Media Pool Bin list the active area, and use

the arrow keys to select and open bins. Then press Command-2 to select the clip browser area

and use the Arrow keys to move the selection from clip to clip. Once a clip is selected, you can

use any of the edit keyboard shortcuts to edit the selected Media Pool clip straight to the currently

open Timeline.

�To select multiple clips: Hold the Shift key down while you’re using the Arrow keys to move the

selection to expand or contract a continuous selection in the Media Pool.

�To select all clips in the Media Pool: Make sure the Media Pool has focus by clicking a clip or

clicking anywhere in the background of the Media Pool, then press Command-A to select all clips.

�To open a selected clip or timeline into the Source Viewer: Press the Return key. Once you’ve

opened a clip into the Source Viewer, you can use the transport controls to play through it.

Duplicating Clips in the Media Pool

If you want to create duplicates of clips in the Media Pool, you can Option-drag one or more clips to

another bin. You can also select the clip or clips you want to duplicate and select Edit > Duplicate

Clips. The duplicated clips will appear in the same bin as the original media. The duplicate clips have

their own individual links to the source media on disk.

Viewer Playback and Navigation

By default, the Edit page presents a traditional source/record style editing experience. The Source

Viewer lets you view individual clips from the Media Pool to prepare them for editing. Meanwhile, the

Timeline Viewer lets you play through your program, showing you the frame at the position of the

playhead in the Timeline.

Source and Timeline Viewers

Source and Timeline Viewers vs. Single Viewer Mode

If you want to change the Edit page layout to hide the Source Viewer, you can choose Workspace >

Single Viewer Mode to instead use just a single viewer to contextually display either a selected Source

Clip or the current frame of the Timeline.

Single Viewer mode

In Single Viewer mode, whatever you select in the Media Pool or Timeline determines which controls

appear in the Viewer, which lets you do nearly everything you can do with two simultaneously

open viewers.

Opening Clips Into the Source Viewer to Prepare for Editing

Once you’ve decided which clips you want to use in your program, you can open them into the Source

Viewer to review them more completely. How this works depends on the Source Viewer’s Live Media

Preview setting.

To skim through a Media Pool metadata or thumbnail

and view clips in the Source Viewer using Live Media Preview:


Turn on Live Media Preview (if necessary) by clicking the Source Viewer option menu and

choosing Live Media Preview.


With the Media Pool open and in Metadata or Thumbnail mode, position the pointer over a clip,

and after a few moments when that clip’s thumbnail starts to skim, you can see the clip you’re

scrubbing in the Source Viewer. Do one of the following:

a)	 As you skim within the thumbnail, the playhead that appears in the thumbnail is locked to the

playhead displayed in the Viewer’s jog bar. While skimming, you can add markers and set In

and Out points

b)	 Leaving the pointer positioned over that clip, use the JKL keyboard shortcuts to play through

the clip, adding markers and setting In and Out points as you like


It takes a moment for skimming to begin, which allows you to quickly move the pointer from that

clip back to the Source Viewer without opening any other clip.

Turning off Live Media Preview lets you use more traditional and controlled methods of

opening clips into the Source Viewer.

To open a clip into the Source Viewer using the mouse:

�Double-click any clip in the Media Pool, or in the Filmstrip of the Media Pool, to open it

into the Source Viewer.

To load the previous or next clip in the bin into the Source Viewer:


Click inside the Source Viewer to bring it into focus.


Press the Up Arrow key to navigate to the previous clip in the currently open bin, and load it into

the Source Viewer.


Press the Down Arrow key to navigate to the next clip in the currently open bin, and load it

into the Source Viewer.

To open a clip into the Source Viewer using the keyboard:


If necessary, press Command-1 to select the Bin list, and press the Up and Down arrows to choose

a folder to view its contents. Press the Right Arrow key to open folders and show any nested

folders within, or the Left Arrow key to close folders and hide their nested contents.


Press Command-2 to select the Media Pool browser, and use the Arrow keys to change the

selection from clip to clip in the Media Pool, up, down, left, and right.


When the clip you want is highlighted, press Return to open it into the Source Viewer.

To open a timeline into the Source Viewer:

�Drag and drop any timeline into the Source Viewer in preparation for either ganging it

to the existing Timeline, or editing it, in whole or in part using In and Out points, into the

currently open Timeline.

Monitoring with an External Video Display

While working in the Edit page, the image that’s displayed on an external video display (if one

is connected) is determined either by the current selection in the Media Pool, or by which

part of the Edit page interface has focus. For example, if you select a clip in the Media Pool

so it’s displayed within the Filmstrip, that clip is output to video. If you then open it into the

Source Viewer, then the contents of the Source Viewer are output to video. If you switch to the

Timeline Viewer, then your timeline is output to video.

Viewer Transport Controls

The Edit page has two Viewers. The left Viewer, when you’re editing, should be set to show either

source video or source audio, so it shows the source clip in any edit you’re setting up. At right is the

Timeline Viewer, that shows the frame at the current position of the playhead in the Timeline. Using

the Source and Timeline Viewers, you can set up a wide variety of edits.

There are identical transport controls underneath each of the Viewers.

The transport controls at the bottom of the Source Viewer

A jog bar appears directly underneath the transport controls, letting you drag the playhead directly

with the pointer. The full width of the Source Viewer’s jog bar represents the full duration of a clip,

while the full width of the Timeline Viewer’s jog bar represents the full duration of the current timeline.

The current position of each playhead is shown in the timecode field at the upper right-hand corner of

each viewer.

A separate jog control, to the left of the other transport controls, provides a way to jog more slowly

through long clips or a long timeline. Click and drag to the left and right to move through a clip or the

Timeline a frame at a time.

Transport controls appear above the jog bar. In the Source Viewer, these controls let you Jump to the

First Frame, Play Reverse, Stop, Fast Forward, and Jump to the Last Frame. In the Timeline Viewer,

these controls move to the Previous Edit, Play Reverse, Stop, Play Forward, and move to the Next Edit.

A loop control governs the looping behavior during playback.

Simple Keyboard Shortcuts for Playback and Navigation

There are many different keyboard shortcuts you can use to simply navigate clips and timelines, and

control playback.

�Spacebar: You can use the Spacebar to start and stop playback.

�Play Again: Press Option-L to immediately restart playback from where the playhead began

without stopping; for instances where you quickly want to replay the beginning of what you’re

listening to.

�Step One Frame Forward/Step One Frame Back: The Left Arrow and Right Arrow keys move the

playhead back and forth one frame at a time, while Shift-Left Arrow and Shift-Right Arrow move

the playhead in one-second increments.

EDIT

�Step One Second Forward/Step One Second Reverse: Shift-Left Arrow and Shift-Right Arrow

moves the playhead back and forth one second at a time.

�Next Edit/Previous Edit: Up Arrow moves the playhead to the previous edit and selects the edit

point, while Down Arrow moves the playhead to the next edit and selects the edit point.

�First Frame/Last Frame of the Current Clip: The Semicolon key moves the playhead to the first

frame of the clip intersecting the playhead, while the Apostrophe key moves the playhead to the

last frame of the clip intersecting the playhead.

�Previous Keyframe/Next Keyframe: Shift-Semicolon moves the playhead to the next previous

keyframe on the left when keyframes are displayed in the Timeline, while Shift-Apostrophe moves

the playhead to the next keyframe to the right.

�Previous Marker/Next Marker: If there are markers in either the Timeline Ruler or within clips in

the Timeline, Shift-Up Arrow and Shift-Down Arrow moves the playhead left and right from one

marker to the next.

�Previous Gap/Next Gap: If any tracks of the Timeline that have Auto Select control enabled have

gaps between clips, Option-Command-Semicolon and Option-Command-Apostrophe moves the

playhead left and right from one gap to the next.

�Timeline Start/Timeline End: The Home key moves the playhead to the first frame of the

Source or Timeline Viewer, while the End key moves the playhead to the last frame of the Source

or Timeline Viewer.

Go to

�In Point/Go to Out Point: Shift-I moves the playhead to the In point set in either the Viewer or the

Timeline. Shift-O moves the playhead to the Out point.

TIP: One of the options in the Editing panel of the User Preferences window, “Always

highlight current clip in the media pool,” lets you decide whether the current selection in the

Timeline is mirrored in the Media Pool.
