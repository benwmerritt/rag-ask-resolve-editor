# Extrude 3D [3Ex]

The Extrude 3D node

Extrude 3D Node Introduction

The Extrude3D tool operates on Fusion’s shape tools, taking flat shapes and transforming them into

dynamic, three-dimensional objects through controlled extrusion, pushing the shape’s edges into the

Z-axis. Additional beveling can be applied to create polished edges and chamfers.

Inputs

There are three inputs to this node, one for inputing the shape itself, and two for materials.

BevelMaterialInput: The pink-colored material input accepts either a 2D image or a 3D material.

It provides the texture for the bevel based on the connected source, such as a Loader node in

Fusion Studio or a MediaIn node in DaVinci Resolve. The 2D image is used as a diffuse texture

map for the Basic Material tab in the Inspector. If a 3D material is connected, then the Basic Material

tab is disabled.

ShapeInput: This yellow input expects a Shape node. This is the 2D shape that you want to bevel and

extrude into 3D space.

MaterialInput: The green-colored material input accepts either a 2D image or a 3D material.

It provides the texture for the shape based on the connected source, such as a Loader node in

Fusion Studio or a MediaIn node in DaVinci Resolve. The 2D image is used as a diffuse texture

map for the Basic Material tab in the Inspector. If a 3D material is connected, then the Basic Material

tab is disabled.

Basic Node Setup

The Extrude 3D node is primarily used to create a 3D shape from a 2D shape. The Shape Node node

is connected to the Extrude 3D node, and the Extrude 3D node is then connected to a Merge 3D

node. Viewing the Merge 3D node will show the Extrude 3D node and other elements connected to it.

A simple sRectangle Shape node connected to an Extrude 3D node brings the rectangle into 3D space.

The Extrude3D Controls tab

Controls

The Controls tab is used to define the polygon characteristics, including extrusion depth and beveling.

Extrusion Style

There are two choices: Classic and Custom. Classic gives a standard uniform extrusion, while Custom

exposes an Extrusion Profile graph that lets you add points and manipulate them to create unique

custom extrusions, like picture frames and knurled buttons.

Extrusion Depth

This slider determines the extruded width of the polygon.

Extrusion Subdivisions

This slider determines the number of subdivisions within the smoothed portions of the

extrusion profile.

Bevel Depth

Increase the value of the Bevel Depth slider above zero to add a bevel to the polygon.

Bevel Width

This slider determines the width of the polygon’s bevel.

Smoothing Angle

Use this control to adjust the smoothing angle applied to the edges of the bevel.

Bevel Front/Back

Use these checkboxes to enable beveling for the front and back faces of the polygon separately.

Common Controls

Materials, Transform, and Settings Tabs

The Materials tab, Transforms tab, and Settings tab in the Inspector are also duplicated in other 3D

nodes. These common controls are described in detail at the end of this chapter in “The Common

Controls” section.

FBX Exporter 3D [FBX]

The FBX Exporter node

FBX Exporter Node Introduction

The FBX Exporter node provides a method of exporting a Fusion 3D scene to the FBX scene

interchange format. Each node in Fusion is a single object in the exported file. Objects, lights, and

cameras use the name of the node that created them. The node can be set to export a single file for

the entire scene, or to output one frame per file.

Setting the Preferences > Global > General > Auto Clip Browse option in the Fusion Studio application,

or the Fusion > Fusion Settings > General > Auto Clip Browse option in DaVinci Resolve to Enabled

(default), and then adding this node to a composition automatically displays a file browser allowing you

to choose where to save the file.

Once you have set up the node, the FBX Exporter is used similarly to a Saver node: clicking the

Render button in the toolbar renders out the file.

Besides the FBX format, this node can also export to the 3D Studio’s .3ds, Collada’s .dae, Autocad’s

.dxf, and the Alias .obj formats.

Inputs

The FBX Exporter node has a single orange input.

Input: The output of the 3D scene that you want to export connects to the orange input on the FBX

Exporter node.

Basic Node Setup

The input to the FBX Exporter 3D node is any 3D scene you want to export. Below, the node is placed

as a separate branch off of the Duplicate 3D node. Only the objects generated by the Duplicate 3D

node are exported.

Controls Tab

The Controls tab includes all the parameters you used to decide how the FBX file is created and what

elements in the scene get exported.

Filename

This Filename field is used to display the location and file that is output by the node. You can click the

Browse button to open a file browser dialog and change the location where the file is saved.

Format

This menu is used to set the format of the output file.

Not all features of this node are supported in all file formats. For example, the .obj format does not

handle animation.

Version

The Version menu is used to select the available versions for the chosen format. The menu’s contents

change dynamically to reflect the available versions for that format. If the selected format provides

only a single option, this menu is hidden.

Choosing Default for the FBX formats uses FBX2011.

Frame Rate

This menu sets the frame rate that is in the FBX scene.

Scale Units By

This slider changes the working units in the exported FBX file. Changing this can simplify workflows

where the destination 3D software that you have uses a different scale.

Geometry/Lights/Cameras

These three checkboxes determine whether the node attempts to export the named scene element.

For example, deselecting Geometry and Lights but leaving Cameras selected would output only the

cameras currently in the scene.

Render Range

Enabling this checkbox saves the Render Range information in the export file, so other applications

know the time range of the FBX scene.

Reduce Constant Keys

Enabling this option automatically removes keyframes if the adjacent keyframes have the same value.

File Per Frame (No Animation)

Enabling this option forces the node to export one file per frame, resulting in a sequence of numbered

files. This disables the export of animation. Enable this checkbox to reveal the Sequence Start Frame

control where you can set the first frame in the sequence to a custom value.

Sequence Start Frame

Enabling this checkbox displays a thumbwheel control to set a specific start frame for the number

sequence applied to the rendered filenames. For example, if Global Start is set to 1 and frames 1–30

are rendered, files are normally numbered 0001–0030. If the Sequence Start frame is set to 100, the

rendered output is numbered from 100–131.

Common Controls

Settings Tab

The Settings tab controls are common to many 3D nodes, and their descriptions can be found in “The

Common Controls” section at the end of this chapter.
