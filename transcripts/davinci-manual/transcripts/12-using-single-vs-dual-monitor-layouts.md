# Using Single- vs. Dual-Monitor Layouts

The Media, Edit, Color, and Fairlight pages can be switched between single-screen and dual-screen

layouts by choosing Workspace > Dual Screen > On. Each dual-screen layout makes it possible to see

many more controls at once, often in a larger workspace that lets you manage more clips, more Gallery

stills, etc. The second screen of a dual-screen layout can be resized but not reorganized.

If you have an single ultra-wide monitor, you can also use the dual-monitor layout, and DaVinci Resolve

will scale the interface as if you had two normal monitors side by side.

In Single-screen mode, you can choose which display shows the DaVinci Resolve UI by choosing

Workspace > Primary Display > (Monitor Name). In Dual-screen mode, this reverses the contents of

both monitors.

Using the Full Screen Timeline Option in the Edit Page

If you’re working in the Edit page in Dual-screen mode and you need the biggest timeline you can get

for working through your program, you can choose Workspace > Dual Screen > Full Screen Timeline

to expose a layout with one large full-screen timeline, and all the other Edit page panels on the

other screen.

Saving Custom Screen Layouts

If you’ve created a particular set of resized panels that you’ll want to use often, you can save it,

alongside other frequently useful screen layouts you may have saved.

Methods of working with custom screen layouts:

�To save a custom screen preset: Customize the various pages of DaVinci Resolve for the purpose

at hand, then choose Workspace > Layout Presets > Save Layout As Preset. Enter a name into the

Save Layout as Preset dialog, and click OK.

�To choose a previously saved screen preset: Choose Workspace > Layout  Presets > LAYOUT

NAME > Load. You can assign keyboard shortcuts for up to five different presets in the Keyboard

Customization window (Application > Workspace > Layout Presets).

�To update a previously saved screen preset: Choose the layout you want from the Workspace >

Layout submenu, make your changes, and then choose Workspace > Layout Presets > LAYOUT

NAME > Update Preset.

�To delete a screen preset: Choose Workspace > Layout Presets > LAYOUT NAME > Delete Preset.

�To export a screen preset for use on another DaVinci Resolve installation: Choose Workspace >

Layout Presets > LAYOUT NAME > Export Preset.

�To import a screen preset: Choose Workspace > Layout Presets > Import Layout as Preset.

Resetting to the Default Layout

If you don’t like the current layout and you want to go back to the default, choose Workspace >

Reset UI Layout.

Undocking Specific Panels of the Interface

There are certain interface elements that can either be docked in their respective pages, or opened in

separate windows.

Media Pool bins can be opened into floating windows simply by right-clicking on the bin and choosing

Open As a New Window in the contextual menu. Even though you’re opening up the contents of the

selected bin, you’re really creating another Media Pool, complete with Bin list, Browsing area, and all

of the organizational controls found in the docked Media Pool. You can have as many floating Media

Pools as you like. They can be dragged to other monitors, and they can be closed via a button at the

upper left-hand corner of the title bar.

The video scopes let you precisely analyze the color and contrast of clips in the Color page.

They can be exposed in their docked position to the right of the Color page palettes by clicking the

Video Scope button in the Color page toolbar.

Optionally, you can click the expand button at the top right of the video scope to open the video

scopes into a floating window, within which you can display all four video scopes together, or

individually, on any monitor connected to your workstation.

Additionally, the Audio Mixer and video scopes are available in many of the dual-screen layouts

available in DaVinci Resolve. The video scopes aren’t just available in the Color page. They’re also

available in the Media and Deliver pages for whenever you need to evaluate the video signal more

objectively, such as when you’re setting up to capture from tape or scan from film, or when you’re

setting up for output.

In the DaVinci Resolve single screen layout, the video scopes can be moved to a second computer

display, if one’s available, and will disappear temporarily if you change pages or switch to

another application.

Interface Conventions

While each chapter covers the unique onscreen controls found in each page of DaVinci Resolve, this

section summarizes how to use some of the more common controls you’ll see.

Contextual Menus

Nearly every panel on every page exposes additional functionality via contextual menus, which

appear when you right-click on the appropriate item. Sometimes, different commands become

available depending on whether you right-click the background of a particular panel, or directly on an

item such as a still or node.
