# New Eye [NE]

The New Eye node

NOTE: The New Eye node is available only in Fusion Studio and DaVinci Resolve Studio.

New Eye Node Introduction

The New Eye node constructs a new image by interpolating between two existing stereo images

using the embedded disparity channels. This node can also be used to replace one view with a

warped version of the other. In Stack Mode, L and R outputs will output the same image.

You can map the left eye onto the right eye and replace it. This can be helpful when removing errors

from certain areas of the frame.

New Eye does not interpolate the aux channels but instead destroys them. In particular, the disparity

channels are consumed/destroyed. Add another Disparity node after the New Eye if you want to

generate Disparity for the realigned footage.

Inputs

The two inputs on the New Eye node are used to connect the left and right images.

Left Input: The orange input is used to connect either the left eye image or the stack image.

Right Input: The green input is used to connect the right eye image. This input is available only when

the Stack Mode menu is set to Separate.

Outputs

Unlike most nodes in Fusion, New Eye has two outputs for the left and right eye.

Left Output: This outputs the left eye image with a new disparity channel, or a Stacked Mode image

with a new disparity channel.

Right Output: This outputs the right eye image with a new disparity channel. This output is visible only

if Stack Mode is set to Separate.

Basic Node Setup

The New Eye node in the example below constructs a new image by interpolating between the two

stereo images using the embedded disparity channels.

Controls Tab

The Controls tab is divided into identical parameters for the left eye and right eye. The parameters are

used to select which eye to recreate and the methods used for the interpolation.

Enable

The Enable checkbox allows you to activate the left or right eye independently. The New Eye will

replace enabled eye with an interpolated eye. For example, if the left eye is your “master” eye and you

are recreating the right eye, you would disable the left eye and enable the right eye.

Lock XY

Locks the X and Y interpolation parameters. When they are unlocked, you can provide separate

interpolation factors for using the X and Y disparity. For example, if you are working with the right eye

and you have the X Interpolation slider set to 1.0 and the Y Interpolation slider set to -1.0, you will be

effectively interpolating the left eye onto the right eye but vertically aligned to the left eye.

XY Interpolation Factor

Interpolation determines where the interpolated frame is positioned, relative to the two source frames:

A slider position of -1.0 outputs the frame Left and a slider position of 1.0 outputs the frame Right. A

slider position of 0.0 outputs a result that is halfway between Left and Right.

Depth Ordering

The Depth Ordering is used to determine which parts of the image should be rendered on top. When

warping images, there is often overlap. When the image overlaps itself, there are two options for which

values should be drawn on top.

�Largest Disparity On Top: The larger disparity values will be drawn on top in the

overlapping image sections.

�Smallest Disparity On Top: The smaller disparity values will be drawn on top in the

overlapping image sections.

Clamp Edges

Under certain circumstances, this option can remove the transparent gaps that may appear on the

edges of interpolated frames. Clamp Edges will cause a stretching artifact near the edges of the frame

that is especially visible with objects moving through it or when the camera is moving.

Because of these artifacts, it is a good idea to use Clamp Edges only to correct small gaps around the

edges of an interpolated frame.

Softness

Helps to reduce the stretchy artifacts that might be introduced by Clamp Edges.

If you have more than one of the Source Frame and Warp Direction checkboxes turned on, this

can lead to doubling up of the stretching effect near the edges. In this case, you’ll want to keep the

softness rather small at around 0.01. If you have only one checkbox enabled, you can use a larger

softness at around 0.03.

Source Frame and Warp Direction

The output of this node is generated by combining up to four different warps. You can choose to

use either the color values from the left or right frame in combination with the Forward (left > right)

Disparity or the Backward (right > left) Disparity. Sometimes you will want to replace an existing eye.

For example, if you want to regenerate the right eye, you would only use left eye warps.

It’s good to experiment with various options to see which gives the best effect. Using both the left

and right eyes can help fill in gaps on the left/right side of images. Using both the Forward/Backward

Disparity can give a doubling-up effect in places where the disparities disagree with each other.

�Left Forward: Takes the Left frame and uses the Forward Disparity to interpolate the new frame.

�Right Forward: Takes the Right frame and uses the Forward Disparity to interpolate the

new frame.

�Left Backward: Takes the Left frame and uses the Back Disparity to interpolate the new frame.

�Right Backward: Takes the Right frame and uses the Back Disparity to interpolate the new frame.

The Settings tab in the Inspector is also duplicated in other Stereo nodes. These common controls are

described in detail at the end of this chapter in “The Common Controls” section.

Splitter [Spl]

The Splitter node

NOTE: The Splitter node is available only in Fusion Studio and DaVinci Resolve Studio.

Splitter Node Introduction

The Splitter takes a stacked input image—for example, created with the Combiner—and provides two

output images: a left eye and a right eye.

Inputs

The two inputs on the Splitter node are used to connect the left and right images.

Left Input: The orange input is used to connect a stacked stereo image.

Outputs

Unlike most nodes in Fusion, the Splitter node has two outputs for the left and right eye.

Left Output: This outputs the left eye image.

Right Output: This outputs the right eye image.

The Splitter Controls tab

Controls Tab

The Controls tab is used to define the type of stacked image connected to the node’s input.

Split

The Split menu contains three options for determining the orientation of the stacked input image.

�None: No operation takes place. The output image on both outputs is identical to the input image.

�Horiz: The node expects a horizontally stacked image. This will result in two output images, each

being half the width of the input image.

�Vert: The node expects a vertically stacked image. This will result in two output images, each

being half the height of the input image.

Swap Eyes

Allows you to easily swap the left and right eye outputs.
