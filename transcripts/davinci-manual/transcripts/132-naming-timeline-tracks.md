# Naming Timeline Tracks

If you’re a stickler for organization, you can also name the tracks on a timeline to identify its purpose.

To rename a track:


Make sure the Timeline View Options are set to either the Filmstrip view or the Thumbnail view,

and that audio tracks are tall enough, so that track names are visible.


To edit the name of any track, click the default “Video X” or “Audio X” track name to select it, then

type your preferred name and press the Return key.

Using the Tracks Index

The Tracks Index presents an easy to use track list that lets you view and control all your track headers

in one place. It also gives more audio information than the track header section of the Timeline.

The Tracks Index is especially useful for controlling projects with a large number of video and audio

tracks. It is accessed by clicking on the Index pane and selecting the Tracks tab.

The resulting list shows all the current tracks in your timeline and their position and attributes.

These are all modifiable right inside the Track Index.

The Tracks Index

Tracks Index Columns

Each track reveals several columns of information. These columns can be rearranged by dragging the

column headers to the left or right, depending on what information is most important to you. Clicking

on a track row selects the track for modification. Right-clicking on a track or tracks allows you to delete

them from the contextual menu.

Using the Tracks Index for video tracks:

�Color: Shows a bar of the track’s assigned color. You can right-click on the track to change

its color.

�#: Shows the track’s number.

�Name: Shows the track’s name. This field is editable.

�Track Controls: Exposes the Lock, Auto Track Selector, and the Enable/Disable Video track

toggle. All of these controls are active.

Using the Tracks Index for audio tracks:

�Color: Shows a bar of the track’s assigned color. You can right-click on the track to change

its color.

�#: Shows the track’s number.

�Name: Shows the track’s name. This field is editable.

�Track Controls: Exposes the Lock, Auto Track Selector, Solo, and Mute controls. All of these

controls are active.

�Format: Shows the audio track type. Right-clicking on this field lets you change the audio

track type.

�ADC: Shows the current amount of Automatic Delay Compensation on the track. Clicking on the

checkbox toggles the automatic delay compensation on or off.

�VCA: Shows the track’s VCA group number.

�Tags: Shows any tags assigned to the track.

Using the Tracks Index for subtitle tracks:

�Color: Shows a bar of the track’s assigned color. You can right-click on the track to change

its color.

Using the Tracks Index options:

�To search for a specific track: Click on the search icon (magnifying glass), and type in your

search terms.

�To select which type of tracks are included in the Tracks Index: Click on the Option menu to

choose which type of tracks will be included in the list. The options are: Video, Audio, and Subtitle.

The Tracker Index lets you control all your track headers in one place.

Toggle Track Header Control States

by Clicking and Dragging

You can change multiple Track Header controls in the Edit page (Lock Track, Visibility, Auto Track

Selection, etc.) by simply clicking on an icon and dragging your pointer up or down across the track

headers. You can do this for one type of control at a time and not across Audio and Video tracks.

Clicking on the Lock icon on A1, then

dragging the pointer down to A3, will

lock all audio tracks in between.

Using Timeline Snapping and Zooming

When preparing to make an edit into the Timeline, you can set the snapping and zoom controls to

whichever state is most useful for the operation you need to perform. For example, if you’re editing

an insert shot into a rapid-fire section of edits in the Timeline, you may want to zoom in to better see

the exact place where you want to place the incoming clip. Since there are many edits at that point,

disabling snapping might make it useful to avoid having the clip jump to the nearest edit point if you

need to move the incoming clip to a very specific frame.

Playhead Snapping:

To turn clip and playhead snapping on and off: Click the Snapping button in the

toolbar, or press N. When snapping is turned on, the In and Out points and markers of

clips all snap to one another and to the playhead. You can also press N to temporarily

turn snapping on or off while dragging a clip in the Timeline, or while scrubbing the

playhead using the pointer (snapping reverts to its previous state when you finish the

operation).

Timeline Zoom presets:

From left to right: Full Extent, Detail, and Custom Zoom controls

Full Extent Zoom: This mode dynamically adjusts the zoom level to encompass the

whole Timeline as you add or remove clips. As your timeline grows by adding clips,

the zoom level decreases automatically to fit the new clips into your Timeline Viewer.

Conversely, the zoom level will increase automatically as you remove clips.

Detail Zoom: This setting zooms the Timeline in on the Playhead to the frame level to

quickly make fine timing adjustments.

Custom Zoom: Zooms the Timeline to the level selected by the Zoom Slider to its

immediate right.

Zoom Slider: Drag the zoom slider to the left to zoom out, and right to zoom in. You

can also press Command-Minus (–) and Command-Equal (=) to zoom out and in. Either

way, zooming is always centered on the current position of the playhead, even if the

playhead is off screen.

To frame every clip into the width of the Timeline: Press Shift-Z. This is a toggle,

so pressing Shift-Z frames your whole edited sequence to the width of the Timeline,

and then pressing Shift-Z again returns the Timeline to whatever level of zoom you

were using previously. Using this keyboard shortcut makes it really easy to navigate

the Timeline when you’re zoomed in, as you can press Shift-Z, move the playhead to

another part of the Timeline you want to work on, and then press Shift-Z again to zoom

back into the new location of the Timeline.

EDIT

Zoom Around Mouse Pointer

You can set up the Edit Timeline zoom controls to stay centered on the pointer as you zoom in or out,

instead of staying centered on the Timeline playhead as usual, by selecting View > Zoom Around

Mouse Pointer. This can be helpful when navigating longer timelines.

With this option enabled, zooming in and out of the Timeline using the scroll control of your pointing

device while holding the Option key down keeps the Timeline centered on the pointer. Deselect this

option to return to the behavior of only zooming in or out centered on the playhead position.

Scrolling Through the Timeline

When you’re zoomed into the Timeline, there are several methods you can use to scroll around

as you work.

�You can scroll left and right, or up and down, by dragging the Timeline’s horizontal and vertical

scroll bars.

�You can scroll left and right through the Timeline, one “page” at a time at the current zoom level,

by selecting Playback > Next/Previous > Timeline Page. If you use these often, you can assign

them a keyboard shortcut.

�You can also scroll up and down the tracks of the Timeline using the scroll wheel, scroll ball, or

scroll gestures of your mouse, trackball, trackpad, or other pointing device.

�You can also scroll within the Timeline by middle-clicking and dragging in any direction, which

works the same as panning around a viewer that you’ve zoomed into. This frees you from having

to use the scroll bars as you move around your edited clips.

If you scroll past the position of the playhead, a small playhead indicator appears in the bottom

scroll bar to let you know where it is relative to the entire duration of your edited sequence.

A small indicator shows the position of the playhead if

it’s outside of the visible area of the Timeline.

Scroll Wheel Controls on Timeline

Additional scroll wheel and key presses can be used to manipulate the Timeline on the Edit page.

To manipulate the Timeline, rotate the scroll wheel while holding down:

Shift: Expands or contracts all the Video or Audio track heights, depending on what section

the pointer is located at when you scroll.

Option: Zooms in and out the view of the Timeline.

Command: Navigates forward and backward in the Timeline.
