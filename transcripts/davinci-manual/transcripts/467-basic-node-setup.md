# Basic Node Setup

The pFriction node is placed in between the pEmitter and pRender. A Shape 3D node is used to

create the region the particles bounce off.

Random Seed

The Random Seed slider and Randomize button are presented whenever a Fusion node relies on a

random result. Two nodes with the same seed values will produce the same random results. Click the

Randomize button to randomly select a new seed value, or adjust the slider to manually select a new

seed value.

Velocity Friction

This value represents the Friction force applied to the particle’s Velocity. The larger the value, the

greater the friction, thus slowing down the particle.

Spin Friction

This value represents the Friction force applied to the particle’s Rotation or Spin. The larger the value,

the greater the friction, thus slowing down the rotation of the particle.

pGradientForce [pGF]

The pGradient Force node

pGradient Force Node Introduction

The particles are affected by a force generated by the gradients in the alpha values of the input image.

Particles will accelerate along the gradient, moving from white to black (high values to low values).

This node can be used to give particles the appearance of moving downhill or following the contour of

a provided shape.

Inputs

The pGradient Force node accepts two inputs: the default orange input from a particle node and one

from a bitmap image with an alpha channel gradient. A magenta or teal bitmap or mesh input appears

on the node when you set the Region menu in the Region tab to either Bitmap or Mesh.

Input: The orange input takes the output of other particle nodes.

Input: The green input takes the 2D image that contains the alpha channel gradient.

Region: The magenta or teal region input takes a 2D image or a 3D mesh depending on whether you

set the Region menu to Bitmap or Mesh. The color of the input is determined by whichever is selected

first in the menu. The 3D mesh or a selectable channel from the bitmap defines the area where the

gradient force occurs.

Basic Node Setup

The pGradient Force node is placed in between the pEmitter and pRender nodes. A Fast Noise node

is used to create the alpha gradient used to modify the velocity of the particles.

random result.

Two nodes with the same seed values will produce the same random results. Click the Randomize

button to randomly select a new seed value, or adjust the slider to manually select a new seed value.

Strength

Gradient Force has only one specific control, which affects the strength of the force and acceleration

applied to the particles. Negative values on this control will cause the Gradient Force to be applied

from black to white (low values to high values).

pImage Emitter [pIE]

The pImage Emitter node

pImage Emitter Node Introduction

The pImage Emitter node takes an input image and treats each pixel of the image as if it were a

particle. The main differences between the pImage Emitter and the normal pEmitter is that instead

of emitting particles randomly within a given region, this node emits pixels in a regular 2D grid with

colors based on the input image.

Inputs

The pImage Emitter node has three inputs. Like most particle nodes, the orange input accepts only

other particle nodes. Green and magenta inputs are 2D image inputs for custom image calculations.

Optionally, there are teal or white bitmap or mesh inputs, which appear on the node when you set the

Region menu in the Region tab to either Bitmap or Mesh.

Input: Unlike most other particle nodes, the orange input on the pImage Emitter accepts a 2D image

used as the emitter of the particles. If a region is defined for the emitter, this input is used to define the

color of the particles.

Style Bitmap Input: This image input accepts a 2D image to use as the particles’ image. Since this

image duplicates into potentially thousands of particles, it is best to keep these images small and

square—for instance, 256 x 256 pixels.

Region: The teal or white region input takes a 2D image or a 3D mesh depending on whether you set

the Region menu to Bitmap or Mesh. The color of the input is determined by whichever is selected

first in the menu. The 3D mesh or a selectable channel from the bitmap defines the area where the

particles are emitted.

Basic Node Setup

The pImage Emitter node is placed at the start of a particle branch, replacing the location of a pEmitter

node. Below, a MediaIn node is used to emit particles using the colors from the clip.

The great majority of controls in this node are identical to those found in the pEmitter, and those

controls are documented in that previous section. Below are the descriptions of the controls unique to

the pImage Emitter node.

X and Y Density

The X and Y Density sliders are used to set the mapping of particles to pixels for each axis. They

control the density of the sampling grid. A value of 1.0 for either slider indicates 1 sample per

pixel. Smaller values will produce a looser, more pointillistic distribution of particles, while values

above 1.0 will create multiple particles per pixel in the image.

Alpha Threshold

The Alpha Threshold is used for limiting particle generation so that pixels with semitransparent alpha

values will not produce particles. This can be used to harden the edges of an otherwise soft alpha

channel. The higher the threshold value, the more opaque a pixel must be before it will generate a

particle. Note that the default threshold of 0.0 will create particles for every pixel, regardless of alpha,

although many may be transparent and invisible.

Lock Particle Color to Initial Frame

Select this checkbox to force the particles to keep the color with which they were born throughout the

life of the particle. If this is off, and the input image changes on successive frames, the particles will

also change color to match the image. This allows video playback on a grid of particles.

Create Particles Every Frame

Enabling this creates a whole new set of particles every frame, instead of just one set on the frame.

This can lead to very large particle systems but allows some interesting effects—for example, if the

particles are given some initial velocity or if emitting from an animated source. Try a small velocity, an

Angle Z of -90, and a seething Fast Noise as a source to get smoothly varying clouds of particles that

you could fly through. Note that if this checkbox is left off, only one set of particles is ever created, and

thus animating any of the emitter’s other controls will have no effect.

X/Y/Z Pivot

These controls allow you to position the grid of emitted particles.

Use Z Channel for Particle Z

If the input image used to generate the particles has a Z depth channel, that channel can be used to

determine the initial position of the particle in Z space. This can have an interesting hollow shell effect

when used in conjunction with camera rotation in the pRender node.

Sets Tab

The pImage Emitter Sets tab

NOTE: Pixels with a black (transparent) alpha channel will still generate invisible particles,

unless you raise the Alpha Threshold above 0.0. This can slow down rendering significantly.

An Alpha Threshold value of 1/255 = 0.004 is good for eliminating all fully transparent pixels.

The pixels are emitted in a fixed-size 2D grid on the XY plane, centered on the Pivot position.

Changing the Region from the default of All allows you to restrict particle creation to more

limited areas. If you need to change the size of this grid, use a Transform 3D node after the

pRender.

Remember that the various emitter controls apply only to particles when they are emitted.

That is, they set the initial state of the particle and do not affect it for the rest of its lifespan.

Since pImageEmitter (by default) emits particles only on the first frame, animating these

controls will have no effect. However, if the Create Particles Every Frame checkbox is

turned on, new particles will be emitted each frame and will use the specified initial settings

for that frame.
