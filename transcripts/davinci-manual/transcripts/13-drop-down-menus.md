# Drop-Down Menus

Most of the buttons and drop-down menus that appear in various toolbars are activated with a single

click. For example, many panels, palettes, and windows expose an Option menu, that appears as three

horizontal dots (people like to refer to these as the “three dot menus,” but they’re option menus), which

expose additional options and/or commands that are related to that particular panel’s function.

Mode drop-down

Additionally, many (but not all) panels and palettes appear with a “Mode” drop-down at the upper

right‑hand corner that lets you choose a different type of function within that palette.

Some buttons, such as transport controls and toolbar icons, display a little downward facing arrow

when you hover the pointer over them, to indicate that you can right-click on these controls to access

checkmark options that govern the functionality of those controls.

Adjusting Parameters

Numeric parameters can usually be edited in a few different ways.

Sliders and Dials

Sliders can be dragged to change the value

of a parameter within a specific range. If

you see a dial, that means a value can be

endlessly edited with no restrictions to the

value. Sliders are typically best for making

large coarse adjustments to parameters.

The “virtual sliders” described next let you

make finer adjustments.

accompanying number fields

Virtual Sliders and Fields

When number fields appear, they can be used

as a “virtual slider” by hovering the pointer over

them until you see the “virtual slider cursor” and

then clicking and dragging to the right to raise the

value, or to the left to lower the value (white arrows

indicate the direction of change). Typically, using

a field’s virtual slider lets you make more precise

adjustments than the actual slider to the left.

Using virtual sliders

Double-clicking fields containing most number

values highlights the number so that you can type

a new value using the keyboard, pressing Return to

confirm the change.

Editing of Number Field Values Using Arrow Keys

You can manually edit numerical parameter values by using the arrow keys to navigate and make

adjustments to the decimal level in number fields.

To use the arrow keys to adjust numerical parameters:


Double-click to select a numeric value in a field, and a highlight appears around that value.


Use the left/right arrows to navigate the cursor to the right of the decimal value you want to adjust.


Use the Up/Down arrows to change the value of that decimal place.


If you select the entire number, the Up/Down arrows will adjust the minimum value.

This cursor is in place to adjust the tenths

position using the Up and Down arrows.

Copy and Pasting of Number Field Values in Virtual Sliders

You can do standard copy/paste functions of any value in a field to any other field.

To copy and paste numerical parameters from a field:


Right-click on the source field and choose copy (Command-C) from the drop-down menu.


Right-click on the destination field and choose paste (Command-V) from the drop-down menu.

Icons and Buttons

Some controls are exposed as icons and

buttons, which you simply click to invoke

whatever functionality they encompass.

illustrate their functionality

Resetting Parameters

To reset any editable parameter to its default

setting, double-click its text label, or click the

reset button, if one appears. Master reset buttons,

typically found in the headers of groups of controls,

reset all controls in that group. Individual reset

controls that appear to the right of parameters

typically only reset that one parameter. If you don’t

see a reset control, then double-clicking the name

of the parameter should work.

Using a Mouse or Other Input Device

Resolve uses all three buttons of a multi-button mouse, or the three buttons available on other type

of input devices, when available. This section provides a brief summary of all the different ways these

three mouse buttons can be used.

Left Button

The left button is always referred to as a click, as in, “click the auto select button.” You click to turn

buttons or other controls on or off, to make selections, and to give areas of the Resolve UI focus so

that keyboard shortcuts will do whatever is specific to that panel or area of the user interface.

Double-clicking the left button usually opens items that are openable, such as opening a clip from the

Media Pool into the Source Viewer. You can also use double-clicking to do things like selecting nodes

in the Node Editor of the Color page.

Right Button

The right button is referred to as a right-click, as in, “right-click a clip in the Media Pool.” Right-clicking

an item or area of the Resolve interface usually opens a contextual menu, exposing additional

commands that are specific to the item or area you’ve right-clicked.

However, some areas of the UI use right-clicking in special ways. For example, when you’re using a

color adjustment curve in the Curve palette of the Color page, right-clicking a control point deletes

that point.

Middle Button

The middle button (usually the scroll wheel button, but you may have to turn this on in the Mouse

panel of the System Preferences) is referred to as a middle-click, which does different things in

different places.

�In all pages, rolling the scroll wheel while the pointer is within a viewer lets you zoom into and out

of the image being displayed when you need to do more detailed work.

�In all pages and panels, pressing and holding middle-click and dragging inside a panel allows you

to scroll the view of the panel’s data in the direction that you drag.

�In the Color page, you can move the pointer over the Thumbnail timeline and roll up to scroll to the

right or roll down to scroll to the left. You can also roll the scroll wheel while the pointer is within

the Mini-timeline to zoom into or out of the currently displayed area. Rolling up zooms out, while

rolling down zooms in.

�Middle-clicking and dragging within a viewer lets you drag the image to pan it around, which is

useful after you’ve used the scroll wheel (or scroll behavior) of your mouse to zoom in.

�You can middle-click and drag within the Edit page Timeline to quickly pan around your edit.

�You can also use middle-click to copy a grade in the Thumbnail timeline of the Color page, by first

selecting the clip that you want to copy TO (with a simple click) and then middle-clicking the clip or

gallery still you want to copy a grade FROM.

�Lastly, if you’re drawing a Bezier window in the Color page Viewer using the Window palette, then

middle-clicking a control point will delete that point.

TIP: If you’re using a pointing device that lacks a third button option, check to see if there are

any third party utilities or drivers that can enable this for you.
