# AVI

The AVI preference is only available in Fusion Studio on Windows. It configures the default AVI codec

settings when you select AVI as the rendering file format in the Saver node.

�Compressor: This drop-down menu displays the AVI codecs available from your computer. Fusion

tests each codec when the application opens; therefore, some codecs may not be available if the

tests indicate that they are unsuitable for use within Fusion.

�Quality: This slider determines the amount of compression to be used by the codec. Higher values

produce clearer images but larger files. Not all codecs support the Quality setting.

�Key Frame Every X Frames: When checked, the codec creates keyframes at specified intervals.

Keyframes are not compressed in conjunction with previous frames and are, therefore, quicker to

seek within the resulting movie. Not all codecs support the keyframe setting.

�Limit Data Rate To X KB/Second: When checked, the data rates of the rendered file are limited to

the amount specified. Not all codecs support this option. Enter the data rate used to limit the AVI

in kilobytes (kB) per second, if applicable. This control does not affect the file unless the Limit Data

Rate To option is selected.

Defaults

The choices made here are used to determine Fusion’s behavior when new tools are added to the

Node Editor and when parameters are animated.

The Defaults preferences

Default Animate

The Default Animate section is used to change the type of modifier attached to a parameter when

the Animate option is selected from its contextual menu. The default option is Nothing, which uses a

Bézier spline to animate numeric parameters and a path modifier for positional controls.

�Number With and Point With: Drop-down lists are used to select a different modifier for the new

default. For example, change the default type used to animate position by setting the Point with

the drop-down menu to XY Path.

Choices shown in this menu come from installed modifiers that are valid for that type of parameter.

These include third-party plug-in modifiers, as well as native modifiers installed with Fusion.

Auto Tools

The Auto Tools section determines which tools are added automatically for the most common

operations of the Background tools and Merge operations.

�Background: When set to None, a standard Background tool is used; however, the drop-down

menu allows you to choose from a variety of tools including 2D and 3D tools to customize the

operation to your workflow.


Fusion Fundamentals | Chapter 75 Preferences

FUSION

�Merge: When set to None, nothing happens. When set to Merge, connecting the outputs of two

tools or dragging multiple clips on the Node Editor uses a standard Merge. Other valid options for

this are Anaglyph, Channel Booleans, and Dissolve.

�Use Merge Only When Connecting Outputs Directly: When this option is active, Merges are not

automatically added when you drag multiple clips from the Finder or Windows Explorer onto the

Flow area.

Global Range

Using the Start and End fields, you can define the Global Start and End frames used when creating

new compositions.

Time Code

You use this option to determine whether new compositions will default to showing SMPTE Time Code

or frames (Feet + Frames) to represent time.

Flow

Many of the same options found in the Node Editor’s contextual menu, like settings for Tile Picture, the

Navigator, and Pipe Style, are found in this category.

The Flow preferences


Fusion Fundamentals | Chapter 75 Preferences

FUSION

Force

The Force section can set the default to display pictures in certain tool tiles in the Node Editor rather

than showing plane tiles. The Active checkbox sets pictures for the actively selected tool, the All

checkbox enables pictures for all tiles, and the Source and Mask checkbox enables tile pictures for

just Source and Mask tools.

When All is enabled, the picture shown will either be a thumbnail of the image rendered by the tool

if the tool has rendered, or if the Show Thumbnails option is disabled, the tool’s default icon is used.

Concatenated transforms will also show a default icon.

�Show Modes/Options: Enabling this option will display icons in the tool tile depicting various

states, like Disk Caching or Locked.

�Show Thumbnails: When this checkbox is selected, tool tiles set to show tile pictures will

display the rendered output of the tool. When the checkbox is cleared, the default icon for the tool

is used instead.

Options

The Options section includes several settings that control or aid in the layout and alignment of tools in

the Node Editor.

�Arrange to Grid: This enables a new node tree’s Snap to Grid option to force the tool layout to

align with the grid marks in the flow.

�Arrange to Connected: Tools snap to the vertical or horizontal positions of other tools

they are connected to.

�Auto Arrange: This option enables the Node Editor to shift the position of tools as needed to

make space when inserting new tools or auto-merging layers.

�Show Grid: This enables or disables the display of the Node Editor’s background grid.

�Auto Remove Routers: Pipe Routers or “elbow nodes” in the Node Editor are considered

“orphaned” if the tools connected to either the input or output are deleted. When this option is

enabled, Orphaned Routers are automatically deleted.

�Pipes Always Visible: When enabled, the connection lines between tools are drawn over the top

of the tool tiles.

�Keep Tile Picture Aspect: Enabling this option forces tool tile thumbnail pictures to preserve the

aspect of the original image in the thumbnail.

�Full Tile Render Indicators: Enabling this checkbox causes the entire tile to change color

when it is processing. This can make it easier to identify which tools are processing in a large

composition. The coloring itself will form a progress bar to alert you to how close slower tools are

to finishing their process.

�Show Instance Links: This option is used to select whether Instance tools will show links,

displayed as green lines, between Instance tools.

�Navigator: The Navigator is a small square overview of the entire composition. It is used to quickly

navigate to different parts of a node tree while you are zoomed in. The checkboxes in this section

determine when the Navigator is displayed, if at all.

On: The Navigator will always be visible.

Off: The Navigator will always be hidden.

Auto: The Navigator will only be visible when the Node Editor’s contents exceed the currently

visible Work area.

�Pipe Style: This drop-down menu selects which method is used to draw connections between

tools. The Direct method uses a straight line between tools, and Orthogonal uses horizontal and

vertical lines.

�Build Direction: When auto-building or laying out a node tree, Build Direction controls whether

tools are organized horizontally or vertically.

�Scale: The Scale menu allows you to select the default zoom level of the Node Editor when a new

composition is created.

Pipe Grab Distance

The Pipe Grab Distance slider allows you to choose how close the pointer must be (in pixels) to a

connection line in the node tree when selecting them.

Link Grab Distance

The Link Grab Distance slider allows you to choose how close the pointer must be (in pixels) to a knot

on a node before a connection is made or removed. 0 pixels means you must be directly on the knot,

while a maximum setting of 20 means you can be 20 pixels from a knot and still connect to it.

Group Opacity

This slider controls the opacity of an expanded group’s background in the Node Editor.

Frame Format

Frame Format preferences allow you to select the resolution and frame rate for the nodes that

generate images like Background, fast noise, and Text+. It also sets the color bit depth for final

renders, previews, and interactive updates in the viewer. The color bit depth settings only apply to

Fusion Studio. Rendering in DaVinci Resolve always use 32-bit float.

The Frame Format preferences


Fusion Fundamentals | Chapter 75 Preferences

FUSION

Default Format

This drop-down menu is used to select the default resolution for Generator tools from a list of presets.

This is only a default setting; these settings can be overridden using the Resolution settings in a

node’s Inspector.

Use the Edit boxes to change any of the default settings. When creating a new setting, press the New

button and enter a name for the setting in the dialog box that appears and enter the parameters.

Settings

The Settings section defines the format that is selected in the Default Format menu. You can modify an

existing format or create a new one.

�Width/Height: When creating a new format for the menu or modifying an existing menu item, you

specify the Width or Height in pixels of the format using these fields.

�Frame Rate: Enter or view the frames per second played by the format. This sets the default

Frame Rate for previews and final renders from the Saver tool. It also sets the playback for the

comp itself, as well as the frame to time code conversion for tools with temporal inputs.

�Has Fields: When this checkbox is enabled, any Creator or Loader tool added to the Node Editor

will be in Fields process mode.

�Film Size: This field is used to define how many frames are found in one foot of film. The value is

used to calculate the display of time code in Feet + Frames mode.

�Aspect Ratio: These two fields set the pixel aspect ratio of the chosen frame format.

�Guide 1: The four fields for Guide 1 define the left, top, right, and bottom guide positions for

the custom guides in the viewer. To change the position of a guide, enter a value from 0 to 1.

The bottom-left corner is always 0/0, the top-right corner is always 1/1. If the entered value’s

aspect does not conform to the frame format as defined by the Width and Height parameters, an

additional guide is displayed onscreen. The dotted line represents the image aspect centered

about Guide 1’s Center values.

�Guide 2: This setting determines the image aspect ratio in respect to the entire frame format width

and height. Values higher than 1 cause the height to decrease relative to the width. Values smaller

than 1 cause height to increase relative to width.

�New: You use the New button to create a new default setting in the drop-down menu. Once you

click the button, you can name the setting in the dialog box that appears.

�Copy: The Copy button copies the current setting to create a new one for customization.

�Delete: The Delete button will remove the current setting from the default drop-down list.

Color Depth

The three menus in the Color Depth section are used to select the color mode for processing preview

renders, interactive renders, and full (final) renders. Processing images at 8-bit is the lowest color

depth and is rarely sufficient for final work these days but is acceptable for fast previews. 16-bit color

has much higher color fidelity but uses more system resources. 16-bit and 32-bit float per channel uses

even more system resources and is best for digital film and HDR rendered images.

Generally, these options are ignored by the composition unless a Loader or Creator tool’s Color Depth

control is set to Default.
