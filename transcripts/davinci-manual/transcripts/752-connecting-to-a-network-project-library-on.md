# Connecting to a Network Project Library on

a DaVinci Resolve Project Server

The main difference between a local project library, and a network project library is that the network

project library resides on another computer connected on the same network running the DaVinci

Resolve Project Server. Setting up the Project Server itself is covered later in this chapter, but as

a network project user in DaVinci Resolve you will need to understand how your local workstation

connects to the Project Server.

Once the hardware and software install is done (essentially all computers connected on the same

network, all running DaVinci Resolve, and one computer running the Project Server), you will need

to authorize your computer to access the network project libraries on the Project Server and this is

handled by “keys.”

If you want to have access to a network project library you must be provided a key to it that is

generated by the Project Server. The key is simply an .xml file with the extension “.resolvedbkey”.

To use an access key to enable easy connection to a Project Server:


Open DaVinci Resolve, and when the Project Manager appears, open the Project Libraries sidebar.


Drag the .resolvedbkey file and drop it anywhere within the Project Manager.


The shared project library should now appear in the Project Libraries sidebar, and if you select it,

you’ll see all of the projects that are located in that project library on the Project Server.

You also may have been set up as a Member of the Project Server, and provided your own

username and password. If that is the case, see the section “Connecting to an Existing Network

Project Library” below.

Once you are connected to a network project library, you can manage them just as if you were

connected locally.

Creating a New Network Project Library

Creating a new network project library is a simple and straightforward process.

To create a new network project library:


Click on the Show/Hide Project Libraries icon in the upper left of the Project Manager to expose

the sidebar.


Select the Network icon from the Project Library options.


Click on the “Add Project Library” button at the bottom of the sidebar.


Select the Create option to make a new project library.


Enter a new name for your project library.


Enter the IP address of the DaVinci Resolve Project Server you’re accessing.


If you are a Member of the Project Server, enter your Username and Password. Otherwise, use the

default user: postgres and password: DaVinci.


Click on the Create button.

You can now create or import new projects directly into your new network project library.

Creating a network project library

Connecting to an Existing Network Project Library

You can connect to an already existing project library on a Project Server by using the following steps.

To connect to an existing project library on a Project Server:


Click on the Show/Hide Project Libraries icon in the upper left of the Project Manager to expose

the sidebar.


Select the Network icon from the Project Library options.


Click on the “Add Project Library” button at the bottom of the sidebar.


Select the Connect option to access the existing project library.


Enter the name of the project library on the Project Server.


Enter the IP address of the DaVinci Resolve Project Server you’re accessing.


If you are a Member of the Project Server, enter your Username and Password. Otherwise, use the

default user: postgres and password: DaVinci.


Press the Connect button.

You can now view and use all the existing projects directly from the existing network

project library.

Disconnecting from a Network Project Library

You can disconnect and remove an already existing project library from the Project Libraries list using

the following steps.

To disconnect from a network project library:


Click on the Show/Hide Project Libraries icon in the upper left of the Project Manager to

expose the sidebar.


Select the Network icon from the Project Library options.


Select the project library you want to disconnect.


Click the Display Project Library Details icon (the circled letter “i” to the right of the project library).


Select the Remove button.


Press the disconnect button in the confirmation dialog.

Disconnecting a project library simply removes it from the available options in the Project

Libraries sidebar. It does not delete the project library. You can either manually delete it in the

OS filesystem, or reconnect to it using the steps described in Connecting to an Existing Local

Project Library.

Backing up a Network Project Library

You can also back up project libraries by exporting them, and then reimport them later.

To backup/export a network project library:


Select the project library you want to back up.


Click the Display Project Library Details icon (the circled letter “i” to the right of the project library).


Select the Back Up button.


Choose a location to which to save the backup in the Backup Project library dialog, and click Save.

Restoring a Network Project Library

You can import existing project libraries to pass multiple projects between systems.

To restore/import a network project library:


Click on the Show/Hide Project Libraries icon in the upper left of the Project Manager to expose

the sidebar.


Select the Network icon from the Project Library options.


Click the Restore button at the top of the Project Libraries sidebar.

The Restore button


Find the project library you need to import using the file import dialog, and click Open.

In the Add Project Library dialog, do the following:

a)	 Enter a new name for your project library.

b)	 Enter the IP address of the DaVinci Resolve Project Server you’re accessing.

c)	 If you are a Member of the Project Server, enter your Username and Password. Otherwise,

use the default user: postgres and password: DaVinci.

d)	 Click on the Create button and the imported local project library will appear in the Network

section of the Project Libraries sidebar.

Duplicating a Network Project Library

You can also duplicate a network project library as an additional backup, or save point in a large project.

To duplicate a network project library:


Select the project library you want to duplicate.


Click the Display Project Library Details icon (the circled letter “i” to the right of the project library).


Select the Duplicate button.


Choose a new unique name for the duplicated library and click OK.

Optimizing a Project Library

Sometimes, project libraries in DaVinci Resolve can become so large that their size affects

performance. In these cases you may need to optimize them to improve access speed by “vacuuming”

the project library of unnecessary spaces and reindexing it. Using the Optimize command can also be

a valuable troubleshooting step in certain cases where you’re having problems opening, importing, or

otherwise using projects saved within network project libraries.

To optimize a project library:


Select the project library you want to optimize.


Click the Display Project Library Details icon (the circled letter “i” to the right of the project library).


Click the Optimize button.


A warning dialog will appear. Click Optimize to proceed, otherwise click cancel to leave the project

library in its current state.

Sharing a Key to a Network Project Library

If you wish, you can share your access key to a network project library with another user on the same

local network.

To export a key to a network project library:


Click on the Show/Hide Project Libraries icon in the upper left of the Project Manager to expose

the sidebar.


Select the Network icon from the Project Library options.


Select the project library you want to share the key to.


Click the Display Project Library Details icon (the circled letter “i” to the right of the project library).


Click the Share Key button.


Select the directory in your file system where you want to save the key to and click save.


Send the resulting .resolvedbkey file to the other user.

Using the DaVinci Resolve

Project Server Application

DaVinci Resolve Project Server is a stand-alone application that lets you create, manage, backup,

restore, and most importantly share project libraries on any workstation. Using this application, it’s not

necessary to launch DaVinci Resolve just to manage your project libraries.

Installing the DaVinci Resolve Project Server

The hardware and software setup required to install the DaVinci Resolve Project server is outlined in

the User’s Guide document included in the program download. On initial startup, you will be presented

with a screen to set up an Admin account for the server. This account will give you full permissions to

adjust any aspect of the project libraries and make changes to the Project Server itself.

On initial startup, the DaVinci Resolve Project Server

will ask you to create an administrator account.

The DaVinci Resolve Project Server Interface

The DaVinci Resolve Project Server interface greatly resembles the DaVinci Resolve Project Manager

with the Project Libraries sidebar open. However, it exposes all of the project library management

tools that are available for creating and managing project libraries, including controls for sharing

project libraries and creating access keys that are essential for quickly and easily creating and

connecting to Project Servers.

The DaVinci Resolve Project Server window

This window has three main UI areas:

�Project libraries list: The Project libraries list in the Project Server application shows every

single DaVinci Resolve network project library on your machine; even ones that have been

disconnected. This makes it easy to find project libraries that you want to reconnect.

�Projects browser: Shows all projects and folders within the currently selected project library as

icons or as a hierarchical list.

�Toolbar: A toolbar at the top of the window shows you functions that are available for managing

DaVinci Resolve project libraries on your workstation.

Project Libraries toolbar controls

(L-R): Sort, Restore, Search

The three controls at the top of the Project Libraries toolbar have the following functions:

�Sort Order dropdown menu: This menu lets you choose how to sort the various local and network

project libraries displayed in the sidebar. You can sort by Database Name, Schema (by date),

Status, or Location in Ascending or Descending order.

�Restore: Imports .resolve.backup files to restore a backed up project library.

�Show Search Field: Displays a search field and search criteria dropdown that lets you search for

project libraries in the sidebar by Name, Schema, Status, or Location.
