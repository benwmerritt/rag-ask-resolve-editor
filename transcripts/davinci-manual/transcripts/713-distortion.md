# Distortion

An effects plugin. Creates audio distortion that’s useful for sound design and effects, ranging from

simple harmonic distortion simulating an audio signal going through primitive or faulty electronics

(such as bad speakers, old telephones, or obsolete recording technologies), all the way to mimicking

an overdriven signal experiencing different intensities of hard clipping (think someone yelling

through a cheap bullhorn, megaphone, or PA system). This plugin includes soft tube emulation in the

output stage.

An animated graph shows the results of adjusting the Distortion parameters of this plugin, giving you

a visualization of the kind of harmonic distortion, waveshaping, and clipping that will be modifying

the signal as you make adjustments. Input and Output meters let you see how the levels are

being affected.

The Distortion Fairlight FX

Distortion has the following controls:

�Bypass: Toggles this plugin on and off.

�Filters: Two filters let you simulate devices reproducing limited frequency ranges.

LF Cut: Low frequency distortion shaping.

HF Cut: High frequency distortion shaping.

�Distortion: Three sets of controls let you create the type and intensity of distortion you want.

Mode buttons: Switch the operational mode of distortion. The one to the left, Distortion, creates

harmonic distortion. The button to the right, Destroy, is a more extreme polynomial waveshaper.

Distortion: Adjusts the amount of distortion that’s applied to the signal. Higher values distort more.

Ceiling: Adjusts the level of input signal that triggers clipping.

�Output: Controls for adjusting the final output from this plugin.

Dry/Wet (%): A percentage control of the output mix of “dry” or original signal to “wet” or

processed signal. 0 is completely dry, 100% is completely wet.

Output Level (dB): Adjusts the overall output level of the affected sound.

Auto Level button: Applies automatic compensation for gain added to the signal due to the

distortion being applied. Having this button turned on prevents the signal from becoming

dramatically and unexpectedly increased, while turning it off frees you to do what you want, if what

you want is to hear a lot of distortion.

Echo

An effects plugin. A classic Echo effect, simulating the reflection of sounds that occur with a delay after

the direct sound is heard. Processes in stereo or mono, depending on the track it’s applied to.

A graph shows the timing and intensity of the echoes generated by this plugin on each channel, and

an Output meter displays the output level of the resulting signal.

The stereo Echo Fairlight FX

Echo has the following controls:

�Bypass: Toggles this plugin on and off.

�Input Format: (Only visible when Echo is inserted on a multi-channel track.) Lets you choose how

multiple channels are input to the echo. Stereo sets separate Left and Right channels. Mono sums

Left and Right to both channels. Left inputs the Left channel only, and Right inputs the Right

channel only.

�Filter: Alters the proportion of frequencies that are included in the delay effect. When the Delay

plugin is inserted on a Mono Channel, the Left and Right sections are replaced with a single

“Delay” section.

Low Cut (Hz): A global High Pass filter.

High Cut (Hz): A global Low Pass filter.

Feedback: Adjusts the frequency of a damping filter for the feedback signal.

�Left Channel: Parameters that independently affect delay on the Left Channel. When the Echo

plugin is inserted on a Mono Channel, the Left Channel and Right Channel sections are replaced

with a single “Echo” section with only the Delay Time, Feedback Delay, and Feedback controls.

Delay Time: Global Delay time for the Left Channel.

Feedback Delay: Echo Delay time for the Left Channel.

Feedback: Feedback percentage of the Left channel back to itself.

L > R Feedback: Percentage of Left feedback signal which feeds back to Right Channel.

�Right Channel: Parameters that independently affect delay on the Right Channel.

Delay Time: Global Delay time for the Right Channel.

Feedback Delay: Echo Delay time for the Right Channel.

Feedback: Feedback percentage of the Right channel back to itself.

R > L Feedback: Percentage of Right feedback signal which feeds back to Left Channel.

�Output: Controls for adjusting the final output from this plugin.

Dry/Wet (%): A percentage control of the output mix of “dry” or original signal to “wet” or

processed signal. 0 is completely dry, 100% is completely wet.

Output Level (dB): Adjusts the overall output level of the affected sound.

EQ ‑ Fairlight EQ

The Fairlight EQ is a 6-band parametric equalizer with controls for boosting or attenuating different

frequencies.

Each band has controls for filter type, including Bell, Lo-Shelf, Hi-Shelf, Notch, Frequency, Gain, and

Q-factor (sharpness of the band).

Fairlight EQ plugin

Master Controls

The Equalizer window has the following controls located in the upper section of the interface

�Preset Menu: Your EQ settings can be saved as presets by clicking the Plus button to the left of

the Preset menu and recalled by clicking the menu and making a selection. You can also scroll

through the presets by clicking the left or right “arrow” (< or >) to the right of the drop-down menu.

TIP: You can save an EQ setting as the default by selecting the Set as Default option from the

Options menu (three dots) located in the upper-right corner, to the right of the Reset button.

Fairlight EQ Presets can be copied and pasted to other instances of the plugin for a

faster workflow.

�Compare Buttons (A and B): These buttons let you quickly compare two different EQ settings.

If you create an EQ setting or select a preset when button A is active (red), then click button B

and create or choose a different setting, clicking between the buttons quickly switches from one

setting to the other.

�Bypass Button: Switched the Fairlight EQ on and off.

�Reset Button: Clicking the circular Reset icon, located in the upper-right corner of the EQ, undoes

the most recent action you’ve taken in the plugin interface.

EQ Graph

This graph displays the current EQ curve with handles representing each EQ band. Although their

position on the graph is based on the parameter settings on the plugin interface, you can drag any

numbered handle to boost or attenuate the range of frequencies governed by an active band, based

on the currently selected equalization filter.

Fairlight EQ graphical display

Bands 1 and 6

These parameters let you adjust the lowest and highest frequencies of the audio signal.

Band enable button: Switches each EQ band on and off.

Band filter type: Bands 1 and 6 can be switched between five filtering options as

described below:

•	 For Band 1, these include (from top to bottom): Lo-Shelf, Notch, Hi-Shelf, and Hi-Pass.

•	 For Band 6, the options are (from top to bottom): Lo-Pass, Bell, Notch, and Hi-Shelf.

Frequency: Adjusts the center frequency of the EQ adjustment.

Q Factor: This parameter adjusts the width of affected frequencies and appears whenever the

Bell option is selected. Lower values cover a wider range of frequencies; higher values narrow

the frequency range.

This parameter does not affect the audio signal when either the Hi-Pass, Lo-Shelf, or Hi-Shelf

filter is in use.

Bands 2 through 5

These bands included the following controls and parameters:

Band enable button: Turns each band of EQ on and off.

Band filter type: These Bands offer four filtering options (from top to bottom): Lo-Shelf, Bell,

Notch, and Hi-Shelf.

Frequency: Adjusts the center frequency of the EQ adjustment.

Gain: Negative values attenuate the selected frequency, while positive values boost it.

This parameter does not affect the audio signal when the Notch filter is in use.

Q Factor: This parameter appears when the Bell setting is selected. It adjusts the width of

affected frequencies. Lower values cover a wider range of frequencies; higher values narrow

the frequency range.

This parameter does not affect the audio signal when either the Lo-Shelf, Notch, or Hi-Shelf

filter is in use.
