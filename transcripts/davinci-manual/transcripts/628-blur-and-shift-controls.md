# Blur and Shift Controls

The three parameters at the top let you alter the foundation of the image to begin creating the look of

an older film.

�Film Blur: Adds just a bit of targeted defocusing to knock the digital sharpness out of the image.

�Temp Shift: Defaults to warming the image just a bit to simulate the warmer bulb of a film projector,

although you can use it to cool or warm the image in varying amounts.

�Tint Shift: Defaults to yellowing the image to simulate damage to the film dyes, but you could move

the slider in the other direction to add a bit of magenta, simulating a different kind of dye failure.

Add Vignetting

These parameters simulate lens vignetting darkening the edges of the image.

�Focal Factor: Adjusts how far the vignetting extends into the image.

�Geometry Factor: Affects how dark the vignetting is and how pronounced the edges are.

�Tilt Amount: Affects how balanced the vignetting at the top of the image is versus the

bottom of the image.

�Tilt Angle: Affects how balanced the vignetting left of the image is versus the right, but only when

Tilt Amount is set to something other than 0.

Add Dirt

These parameters let you simulate dirt particles (not dust) that have adhered to the film.

These are larger specks, although there’s several ways you can customize these.

�Dirt Color: This control lets you choose what color you want the dirt particles to be (black

simulates dirt on a print, while white simulates dirt on a negative).

�Changing Dirt: This checkbox lets you alternate between simulating temporally unstable dirt on

the film (checkbox on) and dirt on the lens that doesn’t move (checkbox off).

�Dirt Density: Lets you choose more or fewer dirt particles appearing over time.

�Dirt Size: Lets you choose the average size of dirt particles to appear.

�Dirt Blur: Lets you defocus the dirt, so it’s not so sharp.

�Dirt Seed: Changes the random distribution of dirt when you change this value, but for any given

value, the results for any given set of control adjustments remain consistent.

Add Scratch

Five sets of Add Scratch parameters let you add up to five scratches to the image, simulating

something scratching the emulsion while the film played.

�Scratch Color: Lets you choose the color you want the scratch to be (scratches can be a variety of

colors depending on the depth of the scratch, type of film, and method of printing).

�Scratch Position: Lets you adjust the scratch’s horizontal position on the image.

�Scratch Width and Scratch Strength: Let you adjust the scratch’s severity.

�Scratch Blur: Lets you defocus the scratch.

�Moving Scratch: This checkbox lets you choose whether the scratch is jittering around or not.

�Moving Amplitude: Determines how far the scratch moves.

�Moving Speed: Determines how fast the scratch moves.

�Moving Randomness: Determines how the scratch meanders about.

�Flickering Speed: Determines how much the scratch flickers lighter and darker in severity.

COLOR

Film Grain (Studio Version Only)

Composites a procedurally generated layer of simulated “film grain” over the image. Individual

simulated grains with falloff are generated to match the resolution of the project.

Main Controls

These controls let you quickly choose and apply a film grain effect.

�Film Grain Presets: This pop-up lets you quickly choose from among different 8mm,

16mm, and 35mm film grain effects.

�Composite Type: Lets you choose a composite mode with which to combine the image with the

grain simulated by this plugin.

�Opacity: Lets you fade the Film Grain effect against the original image.

�Grain Only: This checkbox lets you see just the grain layer that you’re creating, so you

can evaluate its look prior to it being composited into the image.

�Freeze: Stops the motion of the grain animation, allowing you to use the effect for a still image or

freeze frame.

Grain Params

The Grain Params group lets you adjust the quality of the grain.

�Texture: Larger values create more separation between the grains generated by this plugin,

while smaller values bunch them up closer together to create denser grain patterns.

�Grain Size: Larger values zoom into the individual simulated grains generated by this plugin,

while smaller values zoom out.

�Grain Aspect Ratio: Lets you adjust the aspect ratio of the grains.

�Grain Strength: Adjusts the contrast of the simulated grain layer. Higher values produce more

contrast, lower values less.

�Offset: Lightens or darkens the entire simulated grain layer. The practical effect is that lower

values emphasize lighter grains, while higher values emphasize darker grains.

�Symmetry: An asymmetrical contrast adjustment. Lower values darken the lighter grains,

while higher values brighten the darker grains.

�Softness: Lets you blur the grain layer to create even softer transitions from one grain to another.

�Saturation: Lets you make the grain more or less colorful. At a value of 0, grain is monochrome.

Advanced Controls

In the Advanced Controls, the Red, Green, and Blue sliders control the color of the grain. The Shadow,

Midtone, and Highlight Gain controls let you adjust the amount of grain that’s composited into each

of these tonal regions of the image. When the Optimized Mode checkbox is turned on (the default),

performance should improve substantially. Turning on the Animate on Every Refresh checkbox will

animate the grain as you adjust the sliders, allowing you a better idea of how the grain pattern will look

in motion.

COLOR

Film Look Creator (Studio Version Only)

The Film Look Creator gives you the ability to easily alter both the color and physical properties of

an image to mimic motion picture film stock in a single Resolve effect. This effect is not focused on

emulating a specific manufacturer’s film stock, rather it creates a base “Blackmagic” film look that can

be manipulated in a variety of creative ways. The Film Look Creator alters contrast, saturation, hue,

and exposure of an image. It also includes the tools you want to have for film emulation including

halation emulation, film gate, flicker, weave, vignetting, bloom, and more.

Bypass Super 16mm version (Bottom)

Many of the components of the Film Look Creator have specific counterparts in the Resolve FX library.

However, the Film Look Creator combines these film look tools into a single Resolve effect with a

greatly simplified tool set. If you ever find you need more control over an aspect of the look, you can

always disable the effect’s module and use a dedicated Resolve Effect in the node tree instead.

When this effect is applied, an underlying Blackmagic film look is automatically set first. This film

look is driven by over 60 parameters that you get with the plugin active (and all effects off). These

parameters are fine tuned and “baked in” to the Blackmagic film stock. But while these can’t be

adjusted, there are additional controls on the top area of the plugin that you can use to refine and

create unique looks.

The Film Look Creator is designed for scene referred workflows and will work with any camera

source and output display. When using either Resolve Color Management or ACES, this happens

automatically because the plugin uses the timeline color space for input and output by default. The

plugin works for manually display referred timelines (such as DaVinci YRGB) as well, but then the user

must manually choose the transform of the source footage and choose the display transform, which

you can do within the plugin in the Color Space Overrides section.

NOTE: Film Look Creator works best with video that fills the entire frame. Effects like Halation

and Film Gate may give unexpected results with video that is smaller than the frame size.

If necessary, you can fill the frame using the Sizing controls, or in Project Settings > Image

Scaling > Input/Output Scaling select “Scale Full Frame with Crop” rather than the default

“Scale entire image to fit.”

Main Controls

These controls create the foundation of this effect.

�Presets: Automatically sets all controls for a desired preset look. “Clean Slate” does not apply the

underlying Blackmagic Film Look and gives a clean image to work with. “Default No Effects” turns

on the Blackmagic Film Look but disables all the additional effects below.

�Color Blend: Allows mixing the underlying color look and any changes made to other color

settings and split tone controls.

�Effects Blend: The master control to adjust the strength of the spatial effects below. 0% is the

effects completely off, and 100% is the full output of the Film Look Creator.

�3D LUT Compatible: Checking this box will remove spatial effect options which aren’t represented

in a 3D LUT. This allows you to export your custom film look to other programs and camera

hardware via a LUT.

Color Space Overrides

These controls allow you to change the input and output gammas and color spaces of the effect if you

need to manually configure them for a display referred workflow. Please note that no tone mapping

is applied if you change these. The default is “Use timeline,” which will match the color spaces you’ve

selected in the Color Management section of the Project Settings.

�Input Color Space: Sets the input color space; choose one from the drop-down menu.

�Input Gamma: Sets the input gamma; choose one from the drop-down menu.

�Output Color Space: Sets the output color space; choose one from the drop-down menu.

�Output Gamma: Sets the output gamma; choose one from the drop-down menu.

�Output White Point: Sets the display white point. For creative purposes, you can choose one from

the drop-down menu. D65 is the default white point.

Film Look

These controls allow you to adjust the overall parameters of the base film look.

�Film Look Blend: Adjusts the strength of the initial default base film look,

before other parameters are adjusted.

�Skin Bias: Adjusts the skin tones of the film look. Negative values provide warm, darker, and more

saturated skin tones, while positive values provide brighter, rosier, and less saturated skin tones.

COLOR

Color Settings

These controls allow you to change the color information for the film look. These effects will be passed

in a 3D LUT.

�Exposure: A photometric control that adjusts the exposure in stops (+/- 5).

�Contrast: Adjusts the overall S-curve transfer function to add or remove contrast from the shot.

�Highlights: Adjusts the roll-off at the top of the S-curve, allowing you to reign in or expand the

brightest areas of the shot.

�Fade: Adjusts the roll-off at the bottom of the S-curve, allowing you to reign in or expand the

darkest areas of the shot.

�White Balance: This control uses chromatic adaptation to mimic what the source footage might

look like if it were shot under different lighting conditions. Adjusted in degrees Kelvin.

�Tint: Lets you adjust the green/magenta balance of the clip for balancing footage shot under

limited spectrum lighting such as fluorescent, or sodium vapor streetlights.

�Skin Bias: Lets you adjust the skin tones of the image. From -1 (warmer, darker, more saturated)

to +1 (rosy, brighter, and less saturated). This can also be useful if you may, for example, push tint in

one direction, and then use Skin Bias to balance out the image.

�Subtractive Sat: Allows adjusting overall image saturation in a way that more closely resembles a

subtractive method.

�Richness: Affects already more saturated areas, applying subtractive saturation to just

those regions. Can be useful for adding depth and richness, or pulling back a bit on more

saturated areas.

�Bleach Bypass: Simulates this well-known look by adding a desaturated, higher contrast version

of the image onto itself.

Split Tone

These controls add color to shadows and highlights using an opposing hue angle. For example,

adding orange to the highlights, and teal to the shadows to get a more modern cinematic look. These

effects will be passed in a 3D LUT.

�Enable Split Tone: Turns this effect on or off.

�Amount: The intensity of the split tone. This value must be greater than 0 to see an effect.

�Hue Angle: This slider adjusts what complimentary hues are applied to the shadows and highlights.

�Pivot: This control sets where the hue transition occurs in luma. Set to its extreme of

0.000 or 1.0000, the pivot lets you apply a single tint to the shadows or highlight.

Vignette

These controls are simplified window for adding a vignette to the shot. For more detailed control you

could disable this setting and use the Vignette effect instead.

�Enable Vignette: Turns the vignette on or off.

�Amount: Sets the intensity of the darkened areas of the vignette.

�Size: Sets how much the vignette reaches into the frame.
