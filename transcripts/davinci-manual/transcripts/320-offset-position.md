# Offset Position

An Offset Position is essentially the path generated by the tracker. It is the one you select when you

want an object to follow the path. It is available for each single tracker in the Tracker node and refers

to that single tracker only. When you connect the Center X and Y parameters to the offset position of

the Tracker, the node’s center will follow exactly the path of that tracker. Connecting to single trackers

is always useful when you want to match elements with object motion in your footage. For example,

you could track a hand of your actor and attach a ball to the Tracker‘s offset position, so that the ball

follows the exact motion of the hand. Or you could track an element that needs rotoscoping and attach

the mask’s center to the Tracker’s offset position.

Unsteady Position

After using the Steady Position, the Unsteady Position is used to reintroduce the original movement on

an image after an effect or new layer has been added. The resulting motion from Unsteady Position is

basically an offset in the same direction as the original motion.

Steady Size

The Steady Size connection outputs the inverse of the tracked pattern’s scale. When you connect a

parameter, for example the Size of a Transform, to the Steady Size of the Tracker, it will be placed with

a Size of 1 (i.e., the original size) by default at frame 1. This can be changed by means of the Reference

mode in the Tracker’s Operation tab. The resulting size of the Steady Size mode will then counteract

the size changes of the original motion. So if the actual size at frame 10 is 1.15, the result of the Steady

Size will be 1 - (1.15 - 1) = 0.85.

To use Steady Size, you need at least two tracked patterns in your tracker. With just one point, you can

only apply (Un)Steady Position.

Using the Outputs of a Tracker

The tracker outputs described above are published by each tracker pattern created in the Tracker

node. Each Tracker node itself also publishes a Steady Position, Angle, Size and an Unsteady Position.

The values of these Tracker node outputs are calculated using all the patterns in that tracker, as

configured by the Match Move Settings controls in the Tracker’s Operation tab.

The Match Move settings determine the reference frame for

stabilization and the point around which stabilization pivots

Rather than using the Tracker node to perform the Merge operation, an alternative and common way

to use these published outputs is to create a match move by connecting the outputs to multiple nodes.

A tracker is used to track a pattern, and then that data can be connected to multiple other nodes using

the Connect To submenu.

As an example, to use the Connect To menu to perform a match move, do the following:


Track the background clip using at least two tracking patterns in the tracker.


In a different branch, add a Transform node to the background clip.

The background branched to go to a Tracker and a Transform


Right-click over the Transform’s Center and choose Connect to > Tracker1 > Steady Position.

The tracker publishes its output for other nodes to connect to, as done here to stabilize the clip


Connect the foreground to a corner-positioned node, so you can position the corners of the

foreground appropriately over the background.


Add another Transform node to the Node Editor after the Merge.

A second Transform after the Merge is used to add back in the original motion with Unsteady Poisition


Connect the new Transform’s Center to the Tracker’s Unsteady Position. The image will be

restored to its original state with the additional effect included.

To better understand how this works, imagine a pattern that is selected at frame 1, at

position 0.5, 0.5. The pattern does not move on frame 2, so its position is still 0.5, 0.5. On the

third frame, it moves 10 percent of the image’s width to the right. Now its position is 0.6, 0.5.

If a transform center is connected to the Steady Position output of the Tracker, the Transform

node’s center is 0.5, 0.5 on the first and second frames because there has been no change.

On frame 3, the center moves to 0.4, 0.5. This is the inverse of the horizontal motion that was

tracked in the pattern, moving the image slightly to the right by 10 percent of the image width

to counteract the movement and return the pattern of pixels back to where they were found.

Using the Tracker as a Modifier

Another technique for adding a tracker directly to a control is to add it as a modifier. Choosing the

Tracker from the Modify With contextual menu does not use a Tracker node; it adds a modifier in

the Inspector with a set of parameters almost identical to those found in the Tracker node itself. The

benefit here is that the object that you want to follow the tracked path is automatically connected to

the tracker modifier when you apply it.

Applying the tracker as a modifier

The differences between a Tracker modifier and a Tracker node are as follows:

�The Tracker modifier can only track a single pattern.

�A source image must be set for the Tracker modifier.

The Tracker modifier can only output a single value and cannot be used for complex stabilization

procedures, but it is a nice quick way to apply a tracker to a point that you need to follow.

As an example, to apply the Tracker as a modifier, do the following:

Imagine that you needed to track an actor’s eyes so that an unearthly, alien glow could be applied

to the eyes.


Add an ellipse mask node to cover an actor’s eye.


In the Inspector, right-click on the mask’s Center parameter and from the contextual menu choose

Ellipse1 Center > Modify With > Tracker Position.

Right-click over any Center Coordinate Control and choose

Modify With > Tracker Position to add a Tracker modifier


Click the Modifiers tab in the Inspector and drag the MediaIn1 node that you want to track into the

Tracker Source field.

The Modifiers tab includes the tracking controls and a Tracker

Source field to indicate which node to use for tracking

Click the Track Forward button to begin tracking the person’s eye.


Insert a Soft Glow node directly after the MediaIn and connect the Ellipse Mask to the white

Glow Mask input.

A Tracker modifier applied to the Ellipse to create a green glow on an actor’s pupil

You can set a different source image for the Tracker modifier by typing in the name of the node

or dragging and dropping the node from the Node Editor into the Tracker Source field control.

If you have a node (let’s call it node#1) connected to the node that contains the modifier (let’s call it

node#2), the source image for the Tracker modifier will automatically the node #1
