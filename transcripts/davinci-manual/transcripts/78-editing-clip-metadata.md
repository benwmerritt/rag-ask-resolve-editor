# Editing Clip Metadata

Whether you’ve imported media in preparation for editing, or you’ve imported a project for grading

that resulted in media being imported automatically, once you’ve added clips to the Media Pool, it

would behoove you to consider taking the time to review and add metadata to your clips.

At the very least, it would be valuable for you to use the Metadata Editor that’s available in either the

Media page or the Edit page to add information to each clip such as a Description, Shot and Scene

designations, Take information, and possibly some useful keywords such as Character Names, Shot

Framing, Interior or Exterior keywords, and so on. If you’re especially ambitious (or you have a very

responsible assistant), you could go further and add Shoot Day, Camera Type, Audio Notes, and other

valuable information. Much of the metadata that is useful in the day to day work of editing and grading

can be found in the Shot & Scene group, but there are many other potentially useful groups as well

that you should explore.

Keep in mind that the more metadata you associate with each clip, the more methods you have at your

disposal for creating custom Smart Bins (for editing) and Smart Filters (for grading) with which to zero

in on the clips you need for any given situation. This will not only make it easier to find what you need,

but it’ll help you to work faster.

For example, if you’ve entered enough metadata, then you can create multi-criteria Smart Bins or

Smart Filters that let you find the equivalent of “every close-up of Sally inside the diner,” or “every long

shot of Antonio outside in the parking lot.” In a documentary, you could easily isolate “every interview

shot of Louis from camera 1,” or “every B-roll clip with Robyn.” All of this will help you to find media

faster for editing, or to quickly isolate similar clips that you need to match together for grading.

Automatically Imported Metadata

In many instances, metadata is also imported along with the media you’ve added to the Media Pool.

For example, media recorded on BMD cameras may have had a variety of metadata entered into the

camera or automatically generated by the camera, and this metadata is automatically available in

the Metadata Editor. Similarly, Broadcast WAVE files can have quite a bit of metadata entered at the

time of recording, such as scene and take numbers and channel names describing each microphone.

Still images are imported with EXIF metadata. In all cases, available metadata is imported along with

the media and exposed in the Metadata Editor to facilitate workflows where valuable organizational

metadata is being entered on set during the shoot or immediately after ingest.

Using the Metadata Editor

Whenever you select a clip in the Media Pool, its editable metadata appears in the appropriately

named Metadata Editor (so long as it’s displayed). You can use this editor to further massage

the metadata of the clips in a project, adding information on set that will be of help later during

editing and finishing.

By default, clips initially appear with a set of clip metadata called “Clip Details,” that shows some of the

most fundamental details of the clip such as start and end timecode, duration, bit depth, and so on.

MEDIA

Because there are so very many metadata fields that are available, two drop-down menus at the top

right of the Metadata Editor let you change which set of metadata is displayed.

�Metadata Presets (to the left): If you’ve used the Metadata panel of the User Preferences to

create your own custom sets of metadata, you can use this drop-down to choose which one to

expose. Surprisingly enough, this is set to “Default” by default.

�Metadata Groups (to the right): This drop-down menu lets you switch among the various groups

of metadata that are available, grouped for specific tasks or workflows.

Metadata categories drop-down menu

If you want to see a list of every piece of metadata in a clip, you can choose All Groups. Otherwise,

you can choose any set of metadata to narrow your focus to just those items of information.

To edit metadata for a single clip:

Select any clip in the Media Pool, and edit whatever metadata fields you require. The edited metadata

is immediately saved.

To edit metadata for multiple clips:


Choose a metadata set using the drop-down menu in the Metadata Editor.


Select multiple clips in the Media Pool by Shift-clicking, Command-clicking, or dragging a

bounding box around them.


Edit whichever metadata fields you want to. Checkboxes are automatically turned on for any

metadata fields you edit.


When you’re done, click the Save button at the bottom of the Metadata Editor. When you’ve edited

metadata for multiple clips at once, you’ll be prompted to save your changes if you create a new

selection in the Media Pool without clicking the Save button first.

Editing Keywords

While most metadata in the Metadata Editor is edited via text fields, checkboxes, or multiple button

selections (such as Flags and Clip Color), the Keyword field is unique in that it uses a graphical “tag”

based method of data entry. The purpose of this is to facilitate consistency with keyword spelling by

making it easy to reference both a built-in list of standardized keywords, as well as other keywords that

you’ve already entered to other clips.

Once added, keywords are incredibly useful for facilitating searching and sorting in the Media Pool,

for creating Smart Bins in the Media and Edit pages, and for use in Smart Filters on the Color page.

Reaping these benefits by adding and editing keywords is simple, and works similarly to the method of

entering metadata variables.

For more information on metadata variables, see Chapter 16, “Using Variables and Keywords.”

To add a keyword:


Select the Keyword field of the Metadata Editor, and begin typing the keyword you want to use.

As you begin typing, a scrolling list appears showing all keywords that are available using the

string of characters you’ve just typed.


To find a specific keyword in the list, start typing that keyword’s name and this list automatically

filters itself to show only keywords that contain the characters you’ve just typed. Choose which

keyword you want to use in the list using the Up and Down Arrow keys, and press Return to

choose that keyword to add.

The keyword list that appears when

you type within the Keyword field

As soon as you add one or more keywords, they appear as a graphical tag. To re-edit any

keyword, simply click anywhere within the Keyword field to edit it.

To edit a keyword:

�Double-click any keyword to make it editable, then edit it as you would any other piece of text,

and press Return to make it a graphical keyword tag again.

To remove a keyword:

�Click any keyword to select it, and press Delete.

TIP: In macOS, any color tags that are set and defined in the Finder can automatically be

imported as keywords alongside their media clips. To do so check the “Import Finder tags as

Keywords” box in the General Settings panel of the Editing section in the User Preferences.

Editing Metadata Using the File Inspector

The File tab of the Inspector provides a consolidated way to view and edit a subsection of a clip’s most

commonly used media file metadata. It’s easily accessible in the Inspector across the Media, Cut, Edit,

and Fairlight pages. The tab is composed of the following parts:

Clip Details: Presents data about the clip’s data format (codec, resolution, frame rate, etc.).

Metadata: Presents a reduced set of common metadata fields for quick user entry.

�Timecode: The start timecode of the clip. This field is editable if you want to manually change the

clip’s starting timecode.

�Date Created: The date that the clip was created. This field is editable if you want to manually

change the clip’s creation date.

�Camera: Sets the Camera # metadata.

�Reel: Sets the Reel/Card ID.

�Scene: The Scene number of the clip.

�Shot: The Shot letter/number of the clip.

�Take: The Take number of the clip.

�Good Take: This checkbox indicates if the clip is a good or circled take.

�Clip Color: Assign a specific color to a clip that is reflected in the Timeline.

�Name: The clip name field; this can be entered manually.

�Comments: Add a text description to the clip.

Auto Select Next Unsorted Clip: When this box is checked, the next clip in the Media Pool is selected

when you hit the return button after entering a metadata field, and the cursor is automatically placed

in the same field. This allows rapid sequential metadata entry without having to manually click to load

each individual clip in the Media Pool. The Next Clip button will select the next clip in the Media Pool,

regardless of the checkbox status.

Tips for Editing Metadata

Editing metadata is like taking vitamins. Nobody wants to, but you know you probably should.

To encourage you to undertake this task so you can reap the benefits, here are a few pointers.

•	 Don’t start editing until you review your footage and add metadata. If you get into the habit

of entering your clip metadata before you get preoccupied with your edit, you’ll be in a

much better position to edit faster using organizational tools that leverage the metadata

you’ve entered.

•	 Enter metadata starting with groups of clips and then moving to individual clips. Since the

Metadata Editor lets you add metadata for multiple selected clips at once, it becomes easy

to select groups of clips based on their thumbnails for entering information such as Scene

designations, Interior or Exterior keywords, Character keywords, and Framing keywords.

You’ll be surprised how fast this goes, and how useful this information is later on, for both

editing and grading.

•	 After you’ve entered all the metadata you can in groups of clips, then switch to entering

clip-specific metadata such as Shot designations, Take numbers, descriptions of action, and

other clip-specific keywords.

•	 There’s no right or wrong way to edit or use metadata, but a lack of consistency will make it

less useful. For example, if you’re identifying each clip that takes place at the same diner, try

to use the same keyword or descriptive text. If you call half the shots “diner” and the other

half “restaurant,” your ability to easily search for all the diner shots will be compromised.

Audio Classification for Clips

(Studio Version Only)

You can have DaVinci Resolve’s Neural Engine analyze the audio for any clip in the Media Pool, and

then automatically assign it a Category and add keywords about its contents in the clip’s Subcategory

audio metadata. This lets you categorize and organize large amounts of audio clips extremely

efficiently by letting the computer do the tedious work of listening to all the media and assigning it

metadata for you. Of course, you can then modify or change any metadata necessary in the Metadata

Editor in case the computer had miscategorized it.

Each clip analyzed gets Audio Category and Subcategory metadata applied to it. Audio Categories

are types of audio commonly used in post-production; as of this writing the available choices are:

Dialogue, Effect, Music, Silence, and Uncategorized.  Subcategories are more detailed keywords

that are assigned based on what sounds the Neural Engine can recognize in the clip. Subcategories

can be anything like sirens, water, dog, etc. Audio Category and Subcategory are available as Smart

Bin filters that let you quickly organize persistent folders for whatever combination of Categories and

Subcategories you desire. For example, you could create a Smart Bin that contains all clips that have

both Dialogue (category) and sirens and dogs (subcategories) in them.

Category and Subcategory

To Automatically Classify an Audio Clip:


Select the clip or clips in the Media Pool you want to

classify the audio for.


Right-click on any of the selected clips and select

AI Tools > Audio Classification > Analyze from the

contextual menu. DaVinci Resolve will work its

way through analyzing all the selected clips and

will automatically add the metadata to the Audio

Metadata for each clip.


Optionally, you can then review the Audio Metadata

for each clip and correct, delete, or add additional

metadata manually.

MEDIA

Each Category and Subcategory found by this process

automatically creates Smart Bins in the Collections folder,

based on that metadata. You can also define your own Smart

Bins based on combinations of these keywords.

To Remove Classification

Metadata from an Audio Clip:


Select the clip or clips that have Category and

Subcategory metadata that you want to remove.


Right-click on any of the selected clips and select Audio

Classification > Clear Classification from the contextual

menu, then click on Remove in the warning dialog box that

appears. There is no undo for this feature.
