# The Components of a Node Tree

Ambitious grades may require trees of multiple nodes to create the necessary effect. This section

covers the mechanics of putting nodes together into the structures that are described in more detail

later in this chapter.

Every node you add is a “Corrector” node, which is capable of either primary or secondary correction,

depending on whether or not you enable the Qualifier/Window/Matte controls. Even “Serial” and

“Parallel” nodes are simply Corrector nodes that are added in series or in parallel to the previous node

in the node tree; the names are a consequence of how they’re added.

Each Corrector node has two inputs and two outputs, which lets you separately manage the RGB

image-processing channel, and the Key channel that defines areas of isolation for image processing

operations, or transparency for compositing. RGB connections are light green, located at the top left

and right of each node. Key connections are blue, located at the bottom left and right of each node.

Inputs into the node are triangles, and outputs are squares. These inputs and outputs let you control

the flow of image and isolation channels coming into and going out of each node in the tree.

A single node, the RGB (green) and key

(blue) triangular inputs and square outputs

are clearly visible

Nodes are attached to one another via “connections,” seen as lines that connect one node to

another. Image data flows from left to right, starting with the Source input all the way at the left

of the Node Editor, through each node in the tree, and ending at the Node Tree output at the

right of the Node Editor.

A simple serial arrangement of corrections

Here’s an explanation of the different components of a basic node tree where all nodes are connected

in serial, one after the other, and how they work together:

�Source Input: The green source node to the far left is the clip’s image data as processed by the

Sizing and Source decode settings, ungraded. The Source input feeds RGB data to the grade,

and is connected to the RGB input of the first node in your tree. If necessary, you can connect

the Source input to more than one Corrector node, creating multiple simultaneous streams of

image processing emerging from the original source state of the image that you can eventually

recombine in different ways using the Parallel or Layer Mixer nodes.

�Nodes: Each node in the node graph represents a collection of image processing operations that

can be enabled or disabled separately from any other node in the graph. By separating operations

into multiple nodes, you’re able to precisely control the order of all image processing operations

in DaVinci Resolve to create many different corrections and effects. The green RGB inputs and

outputs are used to connect these nodes together. Each node’s thumbnail image shows how the

clip looks at that particular stage of the grade, giving you a visual indication of what each node is

doing, and small badges below each node show you which specific operations are being applied

by that node.

�RGB Inputs and Outputs: The green inputs and outputs at the upper right and left of each node

are used to connect the RGB image that’s output from one node to the RGB input of the next

node. For a Corrector node to have an effect, you must connect both its RGB input and its RGB

output to neighboring nodes in the tree. Furthermore, every single node in the Node Editor must

be connected for a grade to be enabled; having any disconnected node in the node tree disables

that grade until it’s fully connected.

�Key Inputs and Outputs: The blue inputs and outputs at the bottom right and left of each node are

used to route the key channel generated by a node’s Qualifier or Window controls, or imported via

a Matte clip that you previously associated with a clip in the Media page. When you connect the

key output of one node to the key input of another, you basically copy the first node’s key to the

second node. You can also combine the key outputs of multiple nodes in various ways using the

Key Mixer node.

�Node Tree Output: The RGB output of the last node in a tree must be connected to the green

Node Tree output node, which “completes the circuit” of image processing, and passes that

correction on to the next stage in the DaVinci Resolve image processing pipeline. If the output is

not connected, the node tree is disabled and has no effect on the clip. You can only connect one

RGB output at a time to the Node Tree output.

�Second Source Input (for RED HDRx): You can access the alternate highlight exposure of

RED HDRx media by exposing this optional second Source input.

For more information, refer to “Mulit‑Channel RED HDRx Support” see Chapter 147,

“Channel Splitting and Image Compositing,”

�Second Source Input (from Fusion page): You can also create additional sources to route in

masks or mattes created in the Fusion page for use as keys in the Color page.

�Alpha Output: It’s possible to create regions of transparency for compositing directly in DaVinci

Resolve by connecting a key output to an optional Alpha output.

For more information, see Chapter 146, “Combining Keys and Using Mattes.”

Node Badges and Labels

Nodes appear with various labels and badges to help you identify what each node is contributing to

the overall grade. How long a label and how many badges appear depends on the size of each node,

as set by the Node Editor’s Zoom slider.

Nodes showing the kinds of labeling and badges that are available for

identifying what operations each node is performing

Node number: Nodes are numbered in the order in which they appear in the node graph.

Adjustment badges: As you apply various operations within a node, small badges appear

underneath the thumbnail that indicate which palettes have been used to adjust that node.

How many badges are visible depends on how far in or out you’re zoomed into the Node

Editor, and whether or not there are Color Space or HDR labels already taking some of this

room. At larger node sizes, more badges can appear within the width of the node. Each

palette in the Color page has a unique badge. If you apply more operations than a node has

area to display, a single “downward arrow” badge appears.

Animation badge: Nodes with animated parameters display a keyframe badge.

Labeling Nodes

Nodes can be labeled to identify a particular node’s function in your grade. This can make it easier to

revise a grade months later. Node labels are also saved when you save a still, so labels can also make

it easier to decipher a saved grade down the road. At each node’s default size in the Node Editor,

nodes can appear with up to 12 characters of text, although larger nodes can accommodate more text.

To label a node:


Right-click a node and choose Change Label.


Type the label text you want and press Return.

The label you entered appears above the node in the Node Editor.

To edit a node’s label:

�Once a node has a label, you can change the label at any time by double-clicking it.

Selecting Nodes

The node that’s currently selected in the Node Editor is highlighted in orange, and is referred to as the

current node. When you adjust any of the parameters or settings in the Color page, you’re adjusting

parameters within the current node. You can only select one node at a time.

To select a node, making it the current node, do one of the following:

�Click any node in the node graph.

�Choose Color > Nodes > Previous Node (Option-Shift-Semicolon) or Color > Nodes > Next Node

(Option-Shift-Apostrophe). When you do this, the last node loops around to the first one,

and vice versa.

The selected node appears highlighted in orange. You also have the ability to select multiple nodes,

in preparation for doing things like moving them or creating compound nodes (covered later in

this chapter).

To select multiple nodes:

�Command-click each of the nodes you want to simultaneously select.

�With the Node Editor Selection tool chosen (at the upper left-hand corner of the Node Editor)

simply drag to select multiple nodes using a bounding box.

The Node Editor’s

Selection tool

When you select multiple nodes, each one appears highlighted in white, with the exception of the

current node, which remains orange.

Selecting three nodes by dragging a bounding box

When you select another clip in the Timeline, the default behavior is that the last node that was

selected when you worked on that clip is the one that’s selected when you move to that clip

again. However, a setting in the option menu of the Node Editor and the Color panel of the User

Preferences, called “Switching clips,” lets you change this behavior.

For more information on this option, see Chapter 4, “System and User Preferences.”

Disabling Nodes

In the process of creating a node tree, it’s often useful to turn one or more selected nodes off to

disable their effect on your grade. It’s also useful to turn the entire node tree off and on in order to see

“before and after” views of the current clip. Disabled nodes are not processed during rendering, and

they remain disabled when you save that grade along with a still in the Gallery and then apply that

grade to another shot.

Disabling Individual Nodes

Disabling a single node is useful for temporarily disabling adjustments that you don’t think you want to

use but don’t want to discard (however you should remember that it’s alarmingly easy to inadvertently

turn these nodes back on again). It’s also good for giving your client a before and after preview of the

last adjustment.

To toggle individual nodes off and on, do one of the following:

Click the number of any node in the node graph to disable that node by itself.

Select a single node, and choose Color > Nodes > Enable/Disable Selected Nodes

(Command-D).

Disabling Multiple Nodes All At Once

If you select more than one node in the node tree, using any of the methods of turning nodes off and

on described above (including Command-D) will toggle Enable/Disable Selected Nodes. Please note

that the current node outlined in orange is always considered to be part of the selection.

This makes it easy to do before/after comparisons of any combination of nodes doing complicated

adjustments by selecting them, while leaving un-selected nodes doing base adjustments that you

want to leave enabled alone.

Disabling All Nodes

In addition to the Bypass All Grades command, disabling all nodes of a grade at once is another easy

way of disabling a grade to provide a before and after of the original state of the clip (or the color

managed state of the clip if Resolve Color Management (RCM) is enabled). More importantly, it’s a

good way to disable all nodes of a grade in preparation for walking your client through each operation

in that grade node by node, as you turn each node on in turn while narrating how it’s improving

the image.

To turn every node off and on at once, do one of the following:

Choose Color > Nodes > Enable/Disable All Nodes (Option-D) to toggle all nodes off and on.

IMPORTANT: When you turn every node off and then on again, every node is re-enabled,

even nodes that had previously been individually disabled.
