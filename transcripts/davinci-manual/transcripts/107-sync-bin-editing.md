# Sync Bin Editing

The core idea behind the Sync Bin layout is that instead of traditionally scrubbing through your

timeline and clips independently, you now only have to scrub through your timeline. In the Media

Pool, all of the clips that exist with that same timecode value will automatically scrub in sync with the

playhead. This allows you to always have the exact clips that will fit perfectly in your timeline available

at your fingertips.

Selecting this mode automatically changes the layout of the Media Pool and the Viewer to better

accommodate multi camera editing in the Cut page.

Edit in Your First Clip from the Media Pool

Choose a clip that will be your base layer and place it on Track 1. This clip is used as the reference for

all of the other clips in the Sync Bin. Then press the Sync Bin icon.

Media Pool in the Sync Bin

All of the clips in the bin, and its subfolders, are presented in filmstrip mode. The clips are ganged

together automatically by timecode and sorted by camera number. An additional playhead appears at

the current timeline position, and moving any of the three playheads in the Cut page will scrub through

all of the clips in the Sync Bin at the same time.

Viewer in the Sync Bin

The Viewer switches to a live Multi Viewer for up to nine cameras. Each camera is labeled, numbered,

and the active camera in the Timeline is highlighted in red. Cameras that were not active at the current

playhead time are blacked out.

The Sync Bin camera selection can be viewed full screen in the Cinema Viewer by pressing “P” on

your keyboard, allowing you to see a larger, more detailed view of each specific camera. In this full-

screen mode, the Sync Bin view controls operate identically to those in the normal Viewer.

Select Your Timeline In Point

Select the In point on your timeline by scrubbing the timeline playhead to the position you wish

your media to start. As you do this, all of the clips in the Sync Bin will scrub along with the playhead

position. Finding and selecting your edit points in the Sync Bin is greatly simplified, as all of your

possible synced media choices are available instantly.

When the “Video Only” mode is activated in the Cut page, audio from the sources in the Sync Bin are

now muted, and the audio playback is from the clips in the Timeline only.

Select Your Camera

In the Multicam Viewer, select the camera angle you wish to use as your source material by doing one

of the following:

�Clicking on the appropriate camera in the Multicam Viewer

�Clicking on the appropriate camera number icon in the Filmstrip Viewer

�Pressing the number key of the camera on the keyboard

The Viewer will then go into Single Clip mode, showing the camera you selected. To return to the Multi

Viewer, click on the circled X close icon, or simply press the Escape key.

The clip will automatically set an In point at your current timeline position, with a default duration of five

seconds. You can then manually set the Out point of the clip wherever you want.

Make the Source Overwrite Edit

Once your clip’s edit points are chosen, click on the Source Overwrite button and your selected

camera clip will be perfectly positioned in sync on your timeline. The playhead will then automatically

advance to the clip’s Out point, the Multi Viewer will return, and so be instantly ready for the next edit.

TIP: Because the actual media in the Sync Bin determines the overall limit of the clips, and

not the Timeline, it is possible to scroll past the end of the Timeline to make an edit. When

you are past the end of the Timeline, the playhead now represents the Out point instead,

which allows the clip to backfill itself to fit the exact duration required to fill in the Timeline.

Resync Misaligned Synced Clips

While editing with synced Multicam clips, if your shot accidentally goes out of sync with the timeline, it

will be indicated by a warning icon in the lower left of the clip. You can easily bring this clip back into

sync again with the timeline by clicking on the Edit Actions icon, and selecting Resync Clip from the

contextual menu.

If a clip accidentally slips

sync in Multicam footage,

a red sync warning

indicator will now appear

in the lower left of the clip.

Live Overwrite with a Mouse Drag

If you don’t have a Speed Editor, you can still use the paint on functionality of Live Overwrite on

multicam material using your mouse.

By clicking and dragging on camera angle 1 in the Viewer, the angle is “painted on” to the timeline for the same

duration as the drag. You can continue to click and drag multiple angles for a quick multicam production.

To do so, open all your multi camera angles either in the Sync Bin, or the Multi Source viewers. Then

simply click on the angle you wish to use, then drag horizontally in the image to live paint the angle

on the timeline at the playhead position. Then click on another angle and drag it to paint on the

next camera.

Because of the unique syncing nature of the Sync Bin that keeps all your footage locked together, you

can very quickly create an entire multicam production just using simple mouse drags.
