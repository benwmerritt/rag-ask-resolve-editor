So in this episode, I'm going to show you how to potentially save 40% on 12 months of Adobe cloud subscription And you might remember in the last episode I mentioned that I'm actually going to leave Adobe cloud now I've been with Adobe since 1994 These are my original two install discs from 1994. This was Windows 3.1 One I think two floppy discs. I don't think it was Windows 95, but these are nearly 30 years old So that's how long I've been with Adobe and I'm doing everything now in DaVinci Resolve and a couple of other apps that help me With things like Photoshop and that sort of thing So I'm ready to leave but I want to just show you a trick that I found that potentially could get you some discount So stick with it. So this is my Adobe project as you can see I've not opened anything for ages I mean 18 days ago I opened this one which was to create my episode to help you transition from Premiere to DaVinci Resolve and A couple of other things, but I've not really opened this for like 11 months now So it is time to leave. So how do we do that and how do I get you this discount code? Well, what you need to do is go up to your cloud icon here or wherever that is on your Windows machine Maybe and if you click on this icon here, you can go into your account and in there You will get a dashboard that shows you your billing and that sort of stuff So here's my billing and payments. So I'm currently paying 41 pounds 62 a month every single month My next payment is due on March the 13th. Now if we go to my billing history We can have a look in here at exactly how much I've paid in the last I've been with the cloud for nearly 10 years now. So February the 13th 2023 41 pounds 62 and if we scroll down every single month I've been paying this and this goes all the way back to March the 13th 2014 now this is an important date. This is the date that I started my adobe cloud subscription When you have an adobe cloud subscription, it rolls every 12 months. So every March the 13th I'm subscribing for another 12 months. It's not a month at a time So you need to be wary of that if you are thinking of cancelling your subscription because there is a fee to pay To roll you over to the end of the following 12 months I hope that makes sense, but I'm at a point where on March the 13th 2024 My next 12 month contract rolls. So this is a really good time for me to cancel my subscription The amount I've paid over all this time. I've actually added all this up actually comes to 4100 pounds. That's just under $5,000. So that's a lot of money I've spent that could have bought me This which I've got recently. This is the this is the M2 And I've just got hold of this so I'm going to be doing a review of this looking at DaVinci Resolve and that sort of thing But that's the sort of figure that I've paid in 10 years on the creative cloud Now I'm not saying I've not earned good money from having the adobe services there But DaVinci Resolve is servicing everything that I need now So let's have a look at how we get this discount for you Now I'm not guaranteeing that this works for everyone, but this was quite interesting when I actually tried to unsubscribe So I thought I'd record it for you and show you what's going on So let's go back to the account dashboard and in here I can now say manage plan. So I'm going to click on here Now straight away they're offering me a special offer. So get 25 percent off your current plan So they're offering me at 39 pound 95 a month. Now that is actually only It's not even two pounds a month less than I'm paying at the minute because I don't actually pay 51 pound 98 a month So I'm not quite sure what that offer is, but I'm going to ignore that one for now Now I presume these offers are tailored to me. So this might not work for you But it's certainly worth a quick check Even just if you're not going to leave just see if they're offering you something else for another 12 months All right, I'm actually going to go down here and end my service. This is how you actually cancel The adobe cloud so I'm going to cancel my plan And it wants me to put in my password Okay, so the first thing it asks me is which of this describes your experience. So for me It's simply too expensive. I don't have a problem with the product. I just feel it's 41 pounds a month I would rather be given to my children to be quite honest with you. So I'm going to continue And can we help you switch products? I'm going to say no, thanks So this is the important bit. I will be charged an early cancellation fee of 20 pounds 81 As part of the original subscribed agreement, this fee will apply if you cancel now and end your annual commitment early So had I done this in a month's time after march the 13th I would have been charged some sort of feed that would equate to about a year's subscription So you really need to be wary of this. Okay every 12 months it carries on again So I've done this. This is a good time for me to be leaving So I'm going to press continue this to remind me what I'm going to lose. So I'm going to lose premiere And after effects all that sort of stuff. So let's press continue Okay, so this is the interesting bit. So what it's doing now is offering me a different plan Or it's asking me if I want another deal so I can start a chat or I can keep the same plan for 40% less So it's now offering me 25 pound 28 a month, which is actually a pretty good deal That is I think the whole adobe cloud suite for 25 pounds 28 a month is a really good deal But do you know what even at 25 pound 28 a month? I really don't care anymore. I'm leaving. So I'm going to say no thanks So if you did want to take advantage of the 40% discount on offer That's the moment to do it. Don't press no thanks because then you're going to start cancelling your subscription like I'm going to do in a minute And I'm not sure I can't guarantee this happens to everyone like say I've been on the adobe cloud for nearly 10 years So it might be specific to me But I'm just going to finish this off and just show you that I am actually leaving It's given me one last chance. I'm going to press confirm And that is 30 years of adobe So I've done it. I've actually quit adobe after a 30 year relationship with this program. It actually feels quite emotional Um, I've had some great times with it. I've made some great programs I've had some bad times with it as well But I am now completely committed to da Vinci resolve and have been for a long time as a lot of you know I can't take advantage of that 40% discount now. So I hope it does work for you If you want to learn more about da Vinci resolve, I'm going to put some links in the description And maybe a card will appear here somewhere. But in the meanwhile, look after yourselves I hope that discount works for you and I'll see you in a da Vinci resolve tutorial very soon
