So I just want to say a massive thank you to all my subscribers. I've just reached 10,000 subscribers. I can't believe it's happened this quick Thank you so much. I only start the channel in June, June the 28th, and you've got me here in record time I really love all your comments. I'm starting to recognize a lot of your names now, which is really nice I'm going to keep making great content for you. Thank you once again 10,000 is amazing and I'll see you in the next episode look after yourselves and here is that episode so I'm in the magic mask tool I want to show you a technique that's going to help your tracking if it goes slightly wrong so let's just go back to the beginning of this shot and I'm going to mask the whole person Selecting my stroke tool here, and I'm literally just going to do a short stroke So short strokes are the best in the magic mask tool and I'm going to start going forwards So let's get that tracking so I picked up this tip from a black magic webinar from Daria in the week And I thought it was a really good way of correcting slightly wrong tracking So let's just let that track through There's actually a menu in the option tool here that allows you to use faster tracking Okay, so you can see there it's gone slightly wrong now We've got the track the stroke has actually come off her face So I can stop the track there if I want but let's just let it carry on Okay, so let's come back here a little bit and See the point where so it's all good up to there And you can see that that stroke is slowly falling off her face, which is indicating what a person is So from there, I'm going to correct it So about here it's literally coming off now So we're getting this extended mask here, which is not very nice So the technique that I found is literally that you can take the stroke point and physically move it I didn't know you could do that now It's still got the previous mask on there. So if I go back one frame this tool here Goes back one frame and retracts that frame. So that's tracked and now if I track one frame forward You see that we've got a much better mask on there and all I've got to do now is Press this button here and it will retract from that point forward So let's just get that right on her face there because she's come around the corner. So it's moved and I'm gonna press play So we're now retracting from that point And there we go, so that's fixed that mask So it's a really good technique you literally just take the stroke and physically move it and I'll just show you in here There's that menu. I was talking about use fast tracking and also in here you can actually clear selected areas if you had a Isolated area that went bad. You can actually just drag your mouse inside the tracking points Click on here and you can say clear selected track data So I hope that helps you with your tracking when using the magic mask You
