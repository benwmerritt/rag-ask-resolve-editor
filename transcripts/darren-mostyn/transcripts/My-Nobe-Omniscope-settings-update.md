So, it's pretty well documented on my channel that when I'm monitoring my video levels, I'm not using the inbuilt scopes from DaVinci Resolve. I'm using OmniScope from TimingPixels and I love this product. And it's been a while since I spoke about it and I realized that actually my custom layout has actually changed quite a bit. So I'm just going to share that with you, show you some of the new things. One of the main things I love with OmniScope is this product is constantly evolving. They do not sit down. It's the new tools just keep coming. There's now 18 different scopes in here. So I'm going to show you some of my old setup and I'm going to show you some of my new setup. But stick with this episode because I've got some exciting news at the end of it. So let's go and take a look. So my actual scopes I'm using are on a dedicated piece of hardware. So they're coming from my UltraStudio Xtreme but you can work directly in DaVinci Resolve because the OmniScope comes as an OFX plugin. So that's what I'm going to show you here but it's exactly the same layout. So this is one of a few layouts I've got in here and you can just load them up and you can assign this to a stream deck as well. So there's loads of customizability but every single scope here, the layout is customizable, the colors, the shape, the brightness, everything and also the tools within there. So this one for example, this is an old one I've been using for a while. This is a waveform. It's the RGB waveform but I've got it zoomed in to just show the bottom 15%. So I really like this tool for when I'm doing detailed shadow work. This is my focus. So my overall waveforms here and then just this one is just my shadows. And I've got another waveform here just showing me general luminosity and if I press option on here you can actually see your images inside. So if I go to my vectorscope, I've got three vectorscopes low, mid and highs. If I press option you get a superimposed video signal coming in and I can see at a glance exactly what areas will be addressed if I adjust shadow, mid tones and highlights on here. Alright, or lift gamma again. Another tool that I've had in there quite a while is the false color. I love this one just for quickly checking exposure and I can go in changing any of the presets. So I'm running on the Flanders one which is a preset built into Omniscope and I love this tool but to complement it now there's a new one called Skin Tone and this is checking the hue of the skin tone at a glance. I can customize this to exactly how the settings I want it, tons of settings in here and how you want it displayed and this has been a really great tool. Now what I can do is go beyond that. You can actually press option, highlight what's going on here and I can actually see in all the other scopes just the range that I've selected and if you press shift and do that it will actually lock. So you can let go of your mouse or tablet or whatever you're working with and I can now analyze the image and check what's happening across a whole scene. Now I've also added this QC tool here because it's now just HDR so it will analyze my signal and show me what the highest nits level I've got going on. It will check out of gamut for me, it will check blanking errors so that's a fantastic tool to just have there as a little bit of a confidence tool. So I don't want to go into these in much more detail because my good friend Dario for soon has done a fantastic set of tutorials for Timing Pixels where she talks about each of these new scopes in detail so you can check those out. I'll put a link to those in the description. So it's not that often that Timing Pixels do special offers but they've got one coming out for NAB so from the 7th to the 17th of April you can get 20% off Omniscope, that's fantastic but they're very generously offered exclusively for my channel an extra 5%. So if you put the code DARREN at checkout you're going to get 25% off Omniscope. So if you've been thinking about this for a while now is the time to grab this. It's a fantastic product, you know how much I love it. I use it every single day at my broadcast work. Check out Dario's tutorials as well, link is in the description. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in Vegas.
