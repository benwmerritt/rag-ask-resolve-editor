## Transcript
And we're at the hotel in Los Angeles because tomorrow we're making our way to Vegas for NAB. Yeah, can't wait. It's so nice. I'm the master of all the beach ball gun and just jealous and looking to fight. Come here what you want to. No one will believe you. We will know that it ain't right. Oh, whatever helps you sleep at night. The beach is too big and we both know it. The cramps in history and they'll start showing. We've finally reached the end of the world. Everybody knows you're never going to see the light. So what you want to do is say what you want to say. Whatever helps you sleep at night. So we're driving from LA to Vegas and what we're going to do is make a really nice montage of this and it's going to need some fantastic music. Now what I've done is chosen my favorite music library from Audio. They've got this really cool feature called Hands AI. What this does is it uses AI to find the best tracks on their library for me. So I'll show you just how easy it is to find this music. If I go to the main menu here because I've got the pro license, I've got access to Linkmatch AI and Hands AI. So I chose Hands AI for this one. This is fantastic. All you got to do is type what you're thinking. You don't have to do anything other than that. So I put it in Find Song for a Driving Montage American Walk. And it came up with six choices and this is the one that I chose. If you don't like any of these, just reject it and it will find some more for you. So if I close that down, the other choice I've got is if I go back to the main menu, I could have used Linkmatch AI and what this allows you to do is take your favorite track from your favorite artist, copy a link from Spotify or TikTok or YouTube, put it in Press Search, and it will find similar tracks in the audio library. Once you've found a track that you like, if you click on it, you'll see that you've also got access to all the stems. So if I go to Song Element here, I've got the bass, the drums, I can just take the instrumental and you can really then custom create the song to have it exactly how you want it. There's also a full library of sound effects in here, so if I wanted to get a VA engine, for example, you can type in here and it comes up with all these options. You can also download an app on your phone so you can browse the music while you're on the move. So if you think audio might be for you, I can get you your first year's pro license for just $59. That's a saving of 70%. Just enter code DARREN at the checkout. So that is what you're listening to in this montage. Hey, Darren. You're on Route 66, that way to Vegas. I'm going to the Vegas, baby! You can see it, I'll tell you what, that was a bloody long journey through the desert. Welcome to NAB. I'm on the Flambe as Scientific Stand, it wouldn't be the same being at NAB without meeting my good friend, Bram. Again, how are you doing, sir? Doing great, thanks, Darren. Appreciate it, thanks. So what, you've always got some excitement to show, what we've got this year? Yeah, so we got the Baby Brother to the XMP310, which you have. So it's a 26.5 inch, quantum.oled, all the same specifications of the XMP310. Two important applications for this. One, some post-facilities simply don't have room in certain bays, for example, to fit a 31. So this fits on the desk a little bit more easily. And I think the other really important thing is for people using monitors on set, whether that's DITs or whoever it may be, once in the color critical on set, this is truly portable, 14 pounds, could be battery-powered. And the nice thing is it's not that much bigger than like our 24-inch monitors were in the past because the bezel is actually a little bit thinner. So you can put two of these on a DIT card. And then the great thing is you have that uniformity. The DIT was looking out on QD OLED. See the QD OLED in your facility. See a QD OLED TV at home. Just closed loop, you know, same color experience. So it's a shipping. It will start shipping in June. All the same tools, all the same inputs, outputs. The other thing that we've added recently is the ability to do quad view now. So again, more of an on set feature we can get four images on screen at the same time, each with unique look-luts. It has our AutoCal system, of course, which makes it really easy for people to keep their monitors calibrated over time. But yeah, it's the same experience as a 31, just a smaller 4th actor. Yeah, great. Well, I'm still enjoying my XMP310, as you know. We appreciate it. Yeah. Hundreds of hours of programming now. So I'm sure this will do well. Yeah, I appreciate it, Darren. All right, good to see you. Thanks. Thanks. Tom. Hey, Darren. Good to see you. Good to see you. There's some NAB feed. Yes, first time NAB. Very exciting. Okay. Well, you know how much I love your product. I've talked about it all time. Yeah. Yeah. So it's good to see you. Yeah, you invite me on stand-up. You had a little meet and greet with people, which was fun. Yeah. Everyone's super excited about Omniscope, you know that. Yeah, of course. Got any secrets? Can you tell us anything? What's happening in the future? Give us, give me an exclusive from our channel. Yeah, we're working on some life-book features specifically for live people. The idea is live production people, but we're also constantly working on new QC features. Okay. Maybe some QC reporting and tools that might verify if the signal is correct or not to give you some information, some feedback. If you're doing this, it's correct and give you warning if something's not correct. I'm here with the big boys. To me, Sri. Nice to meet you at last. Good to meet you at last as well. So I've been using your product for years. We've never actually met, finally, you're at NAB. Because you're not normally here, are you? No, it's our first time on the event. Okay. How are you finding that? Great. We had so many nice words from people like everybody coming to us and saying we know you from Darren Master classes. Oh, there you go. And yeah, we're hearing so much kind words. It's been very little people who don't know us. So yeah, it's been really good for us. Well, I mean, I love to answer as you know, I've been using it for how many, three years probably? Two or three years maybe? Four years since we first released. So your four years are probably up on music, two and a half, three years. I put on everything as you know. Thank you for your support. But what have you got? Anything in the pipeline that I should get excited about? Well, something worth mentioning for the Vinti users and overall the users of the plugin. We're hardly working on the version eight. That will bring a lot of new features. And we hope to show it like this maybe this summer. And I'm not telling anything like at the moment what features we bring, but I hope it will like blow your mind. Okay, cool. All right, I'm going to stop the recording a minute and find out what that is. All right, it was good to see you here. I just want to say thank you for finding me. For support over the years. Thank you for your support. So you're very kind giving away prizes. So when you get your prizes, this man is the guy who's making that happen. Yeah, everybody who's having any questions, any anything you bother with, just reach out to us. There's support form on the website. Yeah, we always reach out to people and we're always ready to talk. I mean, that's important to me as well. I only talk about products on my channel that I really genuinely use and I think support is a big thing. We're always here to help. Thank you so much. Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you. That's what everything he does. I thought he was this talk, but anyway still. Yeah. Good man. It's good to see you. I'm glad you got into town. Yes. What's new? What's news? How's contour? Contour is good. As a family, I need to know everything. Tell me everything. I will update you all. I've prepared some notes for you. Everything's good, man. Yeah, family's good. Works good. Glad to be here for a couple hours hanging out with you and the rest of the color crew. I mean, we're just hanging out. It's actually really nice to see. There's a lot of YouTubers here this year. Yes, there are. A lot of great colorists, a lot of old friends. So I like just hanging out. I'm glad you could make it because I know you're only here for a few hours. Yeah, precision straight. Glad to sneak away. So version 20, which is your favorite feature? You know, I haven't opened 20 yet. It's installed in a sandbox on a machine waiting for me and I've yet to open it up. It's quite releasing. Yeah. What about you? Color wolves taking my fancy at the moment? Yeah, do you like the new ones that seem good? Yeah, very sensitive at the minute, but I've only been on it a few hours. I want to give it a little bit more push. The magic mask has definitely improved because I'll take that. I tried it on a job that I very rarely use magic mask. Yeah. When I did on a job, it looked great and then classically failed on one shot. Totally. I tried it on that, stick the shot and it works. So it's quite interesting. That's awesome. Yeah, the contour doing well. Yeah, contour is doing great. Having fun with that. We've got some fun stuff planned both for contour and other exciting stuff in that space in a couple of months. It'll be cool. Yeah. Good seeing you. See you buddy. Let's go party. So we have an audio mess in the house. We're at the Coloris Mixer last night. You're one of the main organizers of that. Yes, indeed. That was a great event. It was really, really... Subwaster all our expectations. So if you're in Vegas next year, go to the Coloris Mixer party. It's always good. It's really nice to be a shimosh. So we've got the legend James Willett with me. Steady on. Has it been today, mate? It's been very good, mate. Have you seen anything strikingly amazing? Strikingly amazing. Went through obviously some key upgrades with Blackmagic, which was good. Talked through some of the new color page updates. How's that today? It's day three. I know, but you know, things to do people see. Went and spoke to good color model, monitor manufacturers. Good old Iso. Lovely guys. Yeah, it's been a good time for a fear though, I think. Is this lurking over me shoulder? Oh, well, there he is. It's not Captain AT. Accel-Tek baby. What do you see today that was good? Dara. But what is going on? Are you all making me try to look stupid? It's for Dara and Tobias beers. Oh, right. Yeah, you promised us beer, Dara. Yes, exactly. I'll get you all over here. Finally, back to the hotel. Version 20. I'm getting back. If you find that now, version 20. I can't wait to spend more time on it. Little things I can say that I need to refine and tweak minutes are being fun. That's good. Thanks, great. No worries. Congratulations on your channel. Yeah, thanks. That's cool. Thank you. So that's the end of NAB 2025. I'm just about to go to the airport. Had a fantastic time seeing some brilliant tech hanging around with some great people, meeting all my friends in the industry, hanging out with some of the YouTubers. Got my 200,000 subscribers here, which was brilliant. So looking forward to getting home. We've been in a long few days, but I'd just like to say thank you to audio who sponsored this episode. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
