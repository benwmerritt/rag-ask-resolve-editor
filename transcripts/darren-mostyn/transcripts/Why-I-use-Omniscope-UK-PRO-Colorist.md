Hi, my name is Darren Mosten and in this episode I want to show you the new scopes that I've chosen after 10 years of using the old Ultra scopes I've finally chosen to go with nob omniscopes I want to show you the features why I chose it the cool things it does and you can still use the resolve Scopes there's nothing wrong with them. I just wanted a few extra features and I'm going to show you what they are I've also got a discount code that the guys at time in pixels have given me you can have a discount off any of their products So I'll be showing that at the end. So let's go and take a look So I'm currently working in DaVinci Resolve But just to point out that nob omniscope actually works with other applications as well So I could use this with Adobe After Effects Premiere Assimilate scratch. I can even just look at standalone video files. So it's a really good flexible plugin So how does it integrate with DaVinci Resolve? There's two different ways You can either use it as an OFX plugin or you can use it as a Dedicated standalone machine so the software actually runs on its own on a dedicated machine And that's just fed via either SDI or HDMI So that's the sort of ultimate setup, but it does work very well as an open effects plugin I'm going to show you that now So in DaVinci Resolve there's two different ways to apply the Omniscope The first one is to go to the edit page And what you want to do is go to your effects and drag an adjustment clip to The top most layer so in this case I've only got one layer of video But if I had three or four you would put it on the next available layer and an adjustment clip allows us to place an effect Just on that one clip and it will apply to everything below it so if I go to our filters here and Scroll down you will see our nob omniscope plug-in I'm going to drag and drop that on and then if I select this I can go to my effects and we can open it from here and There it is So now if I just Remove that I'm going to show you the other way. So let's get rid of the adjustment clip and The second way of applying it so whichever one works best for you if you go to the color page and Instead of being on clip if you click up here and go to timeline What that does is it allows you to place an open effects on a node that will apply to your entire timeline and Sometimes you'll find that this isn't here So if I just remove that you might open your timeline It's looks like this in which case you just need to add a serial node And then you're going to take the omniscope and you're going to apply it and you're going to say open display and There is the omniscope now sitting there So what you would have now is you would ideally put this on to a second monitor So you'd have a dual monitor display now for the purposes of this recording I'm going to have to do it on a single screen So you're not going to see my resolve interface too much during this this tutorial now one thing to point out You don't have to do this if you're on windows But if you're on Mac you have to install this plug-in to start with so you won't this won't operate until you've done this movement So you need to go to options and you need to go it's an install plugins And you need to press this install here on open effects and that will allow resolve to actually see the plug-in to start with What you'll then have to do for the first time you launch it you will have to go to connect and You will connect it to DaVinci Resolve so you can see all the other things that it can connect to here So it's recognizing my ultra studio 4k as well and I've got scratching here Premiere Pro or WFFX that sort of thing So you're going to connect it to DaVinci Resolve now You have to do this every single time unless you go to your options here Go to your preferences and you can say auto connect on startup and choose what you want it to connect to so in this case DaVinci Resolve now if you're on a standalone setup you'd want to select the Ultra studio Whatever capture card you have whatever capture card it recognizes So I'm going to have to keep minimizing my scope to go back to resolve but obviously you would have this on a separate display So it's also important that you don't apply any effects to the node that you've got the Omni scope running on So what I'm going to do is come back down to clips I'm going to add a new node and We're ready to go. So let's go back to my scopes So this is a layout that I've created and saved I can save different layouts in here and Basically what I've got up here is I've got my three vector scopes and my hml vector scopes which show me Shadows mid-tones and highlights. So I really love this DaVinci Resolve can obviously do this as well But it to me. It's a it's a really great tool It means I can just look at what's happening with my human saturation in highlights and shadows particularly I've also got over here a separate vector scope which is showing all my scopes together So that's just a regular vector scope that I've got just a little bit smaller down here I'm also running a waveform up here. You see you get these little marks here showing you when you're out of range So I'm up to 95 on this IRE scale I've got an RGB parade down here and I've got this thing here, which is saturation versus luminance So I've got luminance going across here So this is showing me how my brightest parts of my image and saturation is going up here So you can see that we've got quite bright image, but not too much in saturation I've also got here a source signal and what I like with the source signal is either running in black and white or What you can actually do in here if I go to the settings is I can set it to be any particular channel that I want So if you wanted to just monitor the blue channel for example where we often get a lot of noise You can select that there quite easily So I like looking at it in black and white and the other thing I really like is this blanking alarm I'm going to put this on and show you so this looks for any illegal blanking now on this particular program We've actually got a dedicated crop. So it is showing an obvious blanking error here, but what's more typical is When you're zooming in say 4k down to HD and you're doing a bit of sort of pen and scanning It's quite common to just have One or two pixels just leaking through and this and this blanking alarm will show you you've just got a little bit too far on your zoom in So I'm going to switch that off now because that's going to sit there flashing all the time And Next to that I've got this thing called snapshot and this allows me to take a snapshot at any moment in time And that helps me to do color grading. So I'm going to show you that in a moment and also we've got here the false color So this allows me to see Overexposed skin tones things like that. So it's just a really useful one to have on and this has all the standards in this I go to the presets. I'm just right-hand clicking. I've got all these different presets from all these different manufacturers So I've got my sets of the flanders one at the moment And then finally here I have my histogram. So what I'm going to do is clear all this down I'm going to show you how to set one up from scratch. So let's go to our scopes and say remove all So once you first launch nob omniscope You're going to start with a blank canvas and you can basically add all these different scopes You can see there's tons of them in here Source signal waveform vectors go. I'm not going to read them all out But you can basically choose the one you want. So I'm going to start off with a vector scope So I'm going to click on here and I now have a vector scope now You can just free position these any way you want you can make them any size you want But as you move it you get these little guides and these are really good for helping you to position it in a grid So you get a nice even sort of shape So if I drop that right on the middle It shows me that that is going to be a full-screen vector scope if I drop it on this one It shows me the positioning where it's going to place it So if I drop it here that vector scope goes to the top now I want to change this vector scope to be my three-way vector scope So it's going to be my shadows mid-tones and highlights So I'm going to right-hand click and I've now got the ability to either change the scope itself So you can change the scope to be something else at any time I've got these shortcuts to show me so for example split Lmh, which is what I actually want So I can do that horizontally or vertically But down here I've got overall settings and this shows me all the different options that I've got for this vector scope So I'm going to go in here and I'm going to change It to be split Lmh You can change the ratio of what is low mid and high in here and the other thing I'm going to do is I'm going to come down here and I'm just going to dim down the hue ring. So on the outside I just get a slightly less bright view now what I'm going to do now is add another scope So I'm going to say scope and I'm going to add a waveform Okay, so here's my waveform now I don't need to adjust the size of it because what I'm going to do is position it so I'm going to put it just not there I actually want to put it here next to the vector scope. There we go So I've now got that so let's make that a little bit bigger and let's make this a little bit deeper And I'm going to get my scope and I'm going to say add new waveform again But what I want to do is put it next to it. So to put it next to it if I click here or Here it positions it in the middle of the vector scope and the current waveform So what I've got two waveforms here Well, what I want to do is convert this one into luminance. So I'm going to make this a little bit bigger again Let's get these the best size we can get them and I'm going to colorize this. This is my RGB parade So I'm going to right-hand click on here and I'm going to colorize it So there we start to build up our first scopes. Okay, let's go and grab another one So in here I can add now. Let's grab the saturation and luminance scope that I had before And again, I'm going to drop that I want that to be under this waveform here. So I'm just position that Here for now So it's taking up that whole area, but I'm going to change that any moment. So if I go to my view, sorry my scopes Let's grab my histogram And I'm going to drop this here. Nope. Sorry here And then we're going to make this one bigger and then I'm going to drop another scope in here So what I want is my vector scope, but full range. So I'm not going to split it into three So I'm going to say scope add any vector scope Sorry, wrong one actually doesn't matter if it's the wrong one because I can change it after and I'm going to put that here So let's go ahead and change that scope. So I'm going to right-hand click and I'm going to make that a vector scope. There we go So let's bring that sizing out You can see how easy it is to just drag and move these around exactly where you want them So on this scope here, I'm going to just make an adjustment. So I'm going to go to my settings and I want it to be a bit brighter. I'm going to dim down the outside I don't want the rings on there. So I'm going to take those off and I do want it a bit brighter though. So I'm going to go into here and lift up my gain Just like that. So I've got a little bit of a brighter view on this one I'm going to take off the rings as well. So I'm going to hit my settings Oh show rings is there as a quick check and also I'm going to zoom this in slightly So I'm going to just I'm just using my middle mouse and I'm just zooming in a little bit So I've got a slightly zoomed in view. So this one will stay at 100% this one stays zoomed in So I just need to fill this bottom section now you can have as many of these scopes as you want So there's no limit these are resolution independent scopes as well And they do on a 12 bit as well So again here, I'm going to say new snapshot. That was one of them So I'm going to drop that down. I want that to be in the middle here So I'm going to place that how I'm going to do that. Just drop it in the middle here. Let's go to new source so source signal I'm gonna drop that this side and we can just adjust that like that And then I just want the false color on to finish with you've also got audio meters in here as well There's error logging you can add a timecode display. There's 3d color cubes, and here's the false color one Okay, so let's just add that in something like that and I'm going to change the false color to be a Flanders preset and what this is doing is show me over exposed areas So I basically want my skin tones to not go into the yellow and red for sure and There's just a really nice way of checking exposure. So I'm pretty set up So what I'm going to do is save this layout just save that There in one and say okay, so just to show you some of the other scopes if I click in here we've got this one called channel plot and We can change this to be a 3d color cube Okay, and you can drag that around just by taking your mouse and moving it and I can also go in here and change it to timecode With various settings in there as well each of these has got its own unique setting So it's really really good You can really set them up how you want it to be and you've got other ones down here So you've got a audio meter and you've got a goniometer and You've got an error logging to do the error logging you have to right-hand click and say start logging The other thing to look at in here is the preferences So if I just go in here to options and preferences, I just want to show you a few things here You can change the scale on the side. So we're working in IRE 0 to 100 at the minute But you've got all the way up to HLG so you can measure in nits You've also got stream deck support. We've talked about the auto connect on startup already Video level or data level you've got all these different options in here and down here in performance settings You can choose whether you're using your GPU accelerator or not So I'm actually running mine on a dedicated machine. So I'm getting super quick response out of this So you can really see how powerful these omni scopes are but I'm going to show you some really cool things that it does And I never thought I would say that about scopes So let's just make a couple of quick changes in the source signal I'd like this to be my luminance And I'd normally have the blanking alarm on but I'm going to leave it off for now because of this blanking here At the histogram, I'm going to change those to be split RGB mode So using my alt or option key you can do this what I can do is sit on top of any one of the scopes and When I press alt it will transition from the scope trace to the actual source image itself So that's just pressing alt and we now see the image and what saturation luminance is doing is the bottom line here the x-axis is showing our luminance so that's black to white and Up is going from saturation zero to full saturation So when I press alt we get at the source image So you can see his shirt collar here will map to this side and his hair beard and suit will go to this side with his face Somewhere around here in the middle and that just maps down So it's really nice little tool this works in the waveform as well So you can see the trace moving down matching between the source and the trace and in the vectorscopes in the three up Vectorscope it actually shows me what is being highlighted in the shadows mid tones and highlights on the histogram It show me exact RGB values at certain parameters on the source signal and snapshot here We can actually use it as an RGB picker and you can actually change what it selects as well You doesn't have to be RGB. So let's just play this through and I'll show you how useful that is So here on this shot here we could stop there if we want to see the RGB value I could grab this as a snapshot So I'm gonna right-hand click and say take a snapshot And then I'm gonna go back to the shot that we were on before and Then what I can do is have a look at the RGB values So if I click here if I actually press down I Can leave that pinned and then I can go over to his skin tone here And even though I'm in Luma mode it recognizes the actual source signal I can pin that here and now I can have a look at the at the tune compare them So we've got one eight nine one two nine one one one and so we're a little bit cooler on this shot And you can have as many of these pins as you want And to get rid of them just middle mouse click So that shows you what the snapshot does as well as the alts for our RGB picker Now I can actually draw masks on the actual scope itself So if I just drag here I can highlight his skin tone and it gives me an instant view of just what's inside that mass So I can have a look on the vector scope to see how this lines up with my skin line Now when you let go of the mouse it automatically loses the mask, but if you press shift It will keep that locked on so then you can have a look at your different scope So you might want to just have alt s and see this in full view So I can analyze that skin tone now and then drop it back down again So that's a technique I used to use all the time in resolve with a power window But now to be able to just do it quickly in the scope is a real bonus So it's really useful and to get rid of that just simply click I can also highlight areas in the histogram So if I want to see what's happening in this sort of luminance range If I just drag across it it shows me exactly what's happening in that luminance range another nice thing you notice up here on the waveforms and On the RGB parade is you get these values that showing you your outer limits. So if I just bring down my highlights You'll see that I'm actually getting a readout of where the trace is hitting So it's just a good little visual reminder if you press your tab key you can actually get rid of all these menus as well I don't need to see that this is a vector scope and a histogram So literally just press the tab key and then they're gone If you want to reset this snapshot just right hand click And say reset or you can load previously grab snapshots as well So there's lots of good tools in here That's really gonna enable you to get good accurate readings off your scopes. So yeah, this is just great Just been able to do that really quickly. So you see just how customizable and how flexible these scopes are that honestly They're fantastic. I've got music video to grade this week I'm can't wait to get started with the new omniscopes instead of using my ancient Ultrascopes so I had a chat with the nice guys at Tami and Pixels and they give me a discount code to share with you all You can get 15% off any of their products So if you go in my description have a look at the links and I've linked particularly to the omniscope but all their products are in there and You just type in at the checkout Darren 15 and you'll get a 15% discount off any of their products so go and check it out and Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode You
