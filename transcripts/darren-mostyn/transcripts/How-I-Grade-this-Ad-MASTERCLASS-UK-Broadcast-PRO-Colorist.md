So undoubtedly the most common request I get on my channel is can you do a grade from start to finish? Show us the whole thing. We want to see everything. So I'm going to do that in this episode. I'm going to show you every little tip and trick and little secret that I've got. And I'm going to show you that on an actual job. This is a real commercial I did last year. It's actually a Christmas commercial. So I thought it'd be quite apt as we've got Christmas in about 10 days time. So I'm going to really go into it in detail. So stick with it. You don't want to miss any of these steps. So the first thing is the brief that I had. Obviously it's make it Christmasy. We want it cozy, warm, bright, pretty saturated. So that was the brief I was given. And let's go and take a look at what I did. So this is the actual project that I worked on. We've got 11 shots on this commercial here, but it was actually about 13 different versions of this. So a fixed no tree is really important. My no tree here is my 17 no tree. I've got a few different ones that I use depending on the project. And it's basically three serials here, four parallels, three serials, another four parallels and a couple on the end. And I'm going to show you exactly what's in each and every one of those. And I think the best way to explain that is to show you a copy of that, but with all the grades taken off. So I'm going to hit another version here. Now you see we've got absolutely no grade on here at all. So if I press shift and D to bypass, absolutely nothing going on at all. That's just the flat log image from the Arri camera. So I've got a few all the grades have been taken off, but I've got a few nodes where I've just disabled it. And that's because I've got an effect sitting on there. And it saves me rebuilding that effect. But I am going to show you exactly in detail every single menu that I've changed. So I'm displaying my scope so you can see the levels as well. But normally I'm referencing my Omniscopes, which are on a nice large screen beside me at all times. So the first thing we're going to do is look at our color management. This is quite clearly flat and log. We want to do something with it. So I'm going to go into my project settings here, color management, and my color science is set to just DaVinci YRGB. I'm not in the automatic color management, which means I need to use CSTs. And I've done a whole episode on how to use CSTs. I'll put a link to that in the description. The other thing I've changed here is the timeline color space. So we're in DaVinci wide gamma intermediate. And my output color space is of course, Rex seven and nine gamma 2.4, because that's what my monitor is calibrated to. And that's what my delivery format is. All right, so quickly we need to build up the CST so we can actually come out of log and get into a nice good starting point. So my first node here is going to take us from Ari log C into DaVinci wide gamut, because that's the working space that I want to use for that's the working color space I want to use for my grade. So I'm going to go to my effects here just show you quickly exactly what I've done on here. Ari wide gamut three, Ari log C is my inputs and my output DaVinci wide gamut DaVinci intermediate. So I'm going to color grade in DaVinci wide gamut. And what I need to do is be able to see that in Rick seven and nine because my monitor is Rick seven and nine, not DaVinci wide gamut. So I need to put a end CST on now normally what most people do is they go right to the end and they will put the CST here. I put my CST to get me back to Rick seven and nine earlier than at the very end because I like to I'm going to put it on here. Let me just put it on first. So I'm going to switch it on. Now we can see things correctly. Even though I'm going to color grade in DaVinci wide gamut color space here. I've just saved myself a few extra nodes for things that I like to grade in Rick seven and nine color space, not DaVinci wide gamut. These are things like Dehancer and some of the glows grain some things like that. I like to work after the Rick seven and nine color space transform. I think I'm pretty much on my own on that. But that's how I work. I know what I'm doing. I am a professional colorist. I've been I've invoiced and been paid for this job and the clients use me again since so I'm quite happy with my workflow. But normally you'll see people put it right on the end. The only time I would put that CST right at the very end is if I had to do a HDR deliverable in because then it would make my color management a lot easier. You literally just switch at the end and it would go from seven and nine to HDR. I hope that makes sense. If not, check out that CST video in my description. So just to show you the settings in here, I'm going to go to my effects. Obviously, I'm going to DaVinci wide gamut to Rick seven and nine gamma two point four. So Ari to DaVinci DaVinci two X seven and nine grading everything in between with a few spares on the end. All right, let's get into the actual grading. So I'm going to start on my node number two. And the first thing I need to do is analyze my scope. So let's have a look what's actually going on on the image. Now I've got highlights peaking right up here that is quite clearly from this lamp. So I'm not too worried about that. I'm going to deal with that on a separate node. And everything else is looking pretty okay. So I'm just going to give it I think we need a little bit more exposure on our subjects face. First thing I'm going to do before actually grade is just play the clip. Let's just see what's actually going on. Right. So quite clearly, I can see that his face actually lights up as it moves down. So I need to be wary of that when I'm grading, but never just take your first frame as the grading frame. So what I'm going to do is flick into HDR mode. And I'm just going to adjust my exposure slightly. So I'm just going to lift it up. I'm not worried about the lamp blowing at the minute because I'm going to fix that in a moment. So I'm just lifting it up a little bit here. Nothing crazy. It's pretty well exposed. In fact, the colorway and the way the set was built and the wardrobe and everything is giving us that nice Christmas feeling. Anyway, we've got beautiful greens and red saturation is pretty strong. I'm going to add a little bit just to see, but it probably is good for me. Sometimes what I do is I sort of push and then I'll pull back again. So I'm going to get into my primary settings. And I'm just going to pull down a little bit in the lift. I'm just keeping an eye on my scopes here that I don't get anything weird happening. And I'm just going to go and adjust my offset a little bit. Just I'm just trying to get his skin tone looking good. And to measure that, I can actually put my mouse on his skin. And I can see that on the scopes. I'm looking here at that line. And you can see there you get a little circle. And if you want to bring that up, you need to go into your settings and its display, qualifier focus. Now on my only scope, I don't need to worry about that because I can actually just grab my mouse and I can sample skin really easily like that at any time. So that's a really cool feature with that. So I'm just going to lift up my gain a little bit more than that. And I think we're good. Now I want to use a film print emulation lutz on here. So that's going to change the color quality just slightly. So I need to add that at this point before I grade any further. So that is obviously down at the end because I'm grading underneath it. And it's sitting here. So it's the Kodak 2383 LUT that comes with the Vintry Resolve. I'm just going to activate it now. And just to show you what's going on here, because this is a compound node, I'm going to right click and say show compound node. This one here is taking me out of Gamma 2.4 and put me into Cine Film Log because that's what that LUT is expecting. And this is the regular Kodak film LUT. So I'm going to come back out. So that way you know what's going on here. So I'm just going to enable and disable that. But you see that gives it really nice, really nice poppy highlights. Nothing's going to change down here too much apart from a bit of the tone and the color in the shadows. But I'm really liking that. So now I can carry on grading, but I'm now looking at it underneath my Kodak film LUT. Alright, so now I'm happy with our subject exposure and the skin tone is looking good. I'm going to move on to the next point and that is to get this lamp down. So I'm just going to pull this back a little bit. I'm going to put a window around this and this is going to have a really nice soft edge on it. So you're not going to see what's going on here. I just need to move my scopes over a little bit. I normally do this with a panel, but I'm doing it in the software so you can see what I'm doing. Okay, now there's several ways to get this brightness down. So I'm keeping an eye on my scopes up here. But one of the easiest ways, in fact, if I put that onto not Vectorscope, but if I put that down, it's my waveform, I can see that clearer. So I could use Curves, I could use my HDR tools. And what I found the best result I got from this was actually using the Highlight tool and my Gain. So I'm just going to bring my highlights down a little bit. I don't want to go too far. Let's go somewhere around about there and then I'm just going to bring my Gain down a little bit. If I went too far with the highlights, this starts to get a little bit dirty. So I'm bringing that down. I'm going to bring down my gamma a little bit as well, just to get a bit more definition in his hand here. But as you can see, you can't see that shape at all. I've got that really nice and loose. And I'm just going to warm this up a little bit. So I'm going to just do that with color temperatures, probably the quickest way. So let's just check before and after. Every time I create a new node, or every time I've done work on a new node, I always just switch it on and off after I've done the work, just to check that I'm actually improving the image. So if you're enjoying this grade breakdown so far, think about subscribing and hitting the like button. It does make a difference. I know people ask all the time, so I get it, but it does make a difference. In the meanwhile, let's go and have a look at the rest of the grade. All right, so I'm going to move on to my parallels now. And this is where I start doing a lot of my windows and shapes and that sort of thing. I've done a whole episode on parallels. Link will be in the description, of course. And first thing I want to do is just pop our subject out a little bit more. So I'm going to go down here. I'm going to create a shape, something like that. Again, let's get some softness going on. I'm going to move the scopes right out of the way for a minute. And I'm just going to straighten here and just lift a little bit up there with my game tool. I'm just keeping an eye on those highlights as well. Let's just play that through just to check. I'm going to check the color temperature on here as well, just see if we can get that any better. Maybe somewhere around about there. It's only slight, but that is looking better. So, and I want to do the opposite of that. I want to affect the outside of our subject. So I'm going to take my key feed here, feed it into the next node down, and I'm just going to invert that. And now anything I do on here will affect the outside. And you can see that's helping that lamp as well. Now I'm just bringing down my gamma a little bit. Let's see what happens with offset. Something like that. And what I want to do is see the results of the two of these. Now I'm just going to add a little bit more color temperature there. And let's highlight the two of them, enable and disable. So there I'm seeing the result of the two nodes together. So that's looking much better now. So reanalyzing the image now. Let's bring our scopes back a little bit, see what we've got. But just reanalyzing, we've got a little bit of peak going on here. So this red is pretty vibrant. And that's quite clearly his scarf. So I'm going to address that on the next node. So let's click down here and move that out of the way again. This is why I like having scopes separately on an external monitor. And first thing I'm going to do is key the scarf. So I'm going to go to my keyer and grab a 3D key and a key through here. And I put my highlight tool on, which is up here if you don't have a panel. And it's clearly qualified far too much range. So I'm just going to reduce that using the negative tool. Let's give it all this extra stuff that it's picked up on the qualification. And that's looking a lot better. So what I can do now is use these cleanup tools in here, just to get that finessed a little bit better. I don't have to get this exact by any stretch of imagination. All right, and just to finish it off, I'm going to put a window around it just to make sure what I'm trying to do here is protect his skin. I don't want his skin being affected by what I'm about to do. I'm just going to track that because I can, even if it doesn't need tracking, I'll just track because it's so quick to do. Let's take my highlight. And what I want to do now is go into a curve. I'm going to use this one here, which is saturation versus luminance. So what that does is obviously luminance, high luminance, low and low saturation to high saturation. And what this tool lets me do is drop luminance in the most saturated part. So it's just going to make his scarf look a little bit better. So what I'm going to do is just draw some points around here. And you switch that on and off. And you can see that works really well. Just takes that edge off the scarf. Okay, now it's still sitting quite strongly up here. So I'm going to reduce saturation a little bit as well, but only a little bit. So that's before and after. And that's pretty much it. There's one more thing that I'm going to do. But again, just because I have 17 nose doesn't mean I'm necessarily using them all. It just allows me to be flexible when I'm working with big projects like this. And you can see I didn't actually have to do too much of this image to get it looking great straight away. I'm just going to check his skin tone as we move through, which is good. But the main work was all just done on one node here. So the next thing I'm going to do is actually after the 709 node. And this is using this effect here, which is called DeHanser. I use DeHanser all the time. I love it. But I find it works better in Rec. 709 than it does in DaVinci Wide Gamut. There is a later version of 5.3.0. So that might be why. But at the minute, I'm using it in Rec. 709. And I'll show you exactly what I'm doing with it. I'm coming down here and I'm adding Halation. So if you don't have DeHanser, there is a Halation tool in DaVinci Resolve. I've done another episode on DeHanser versus Halation in Resolve. I'll put a link to that in the description, of course. And I'm also using Bloom here. So if I just switch this on and off, you can see mainly where that's working is around his face here. So it's just giving it a really nice subtle glow. But look how subtle that is. I've hardly got anything going on. Because what I do is I drop the impact down from full right down here. Again, same with the Bloom. I don't have it as shiny as that. Let's just put it right back. And it just adds a nice little bit of texture to the image. So I hope that's answered what you wanted in the comments. You wanted to see a full grade breakdown. That is the actual program. I've left no stone unturned. I've showed you every single node. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
