So this is this speed editor from Blackmagic. I love this bit of kit, this is fantastic and in this episode I'm going to show you some of the cool things that it does and I'm also going to show you what works in the color page. So let's go and take a look. So over here on the interface we've got, we're in the cut page by the way, and we've got several folders here and what I'm going to do is first show you how the source tape works. Now if you're not familiar with source tape you should check out an episode that I did a few months ago called source tape and there's also an episode on how to use the cut page so it might be worth looking at those if you're new to the cut page. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into one of these. This is all our footage that's in the media page. If I just go into this one B-roll you'll see that I've got three more folders. Now if I want to view what's in those three folders all I've got to do is come to the speed editor and literally press source and that goes into source tape mode. So now I can scroll through that and I'm having a look at all the footage that's in those three folders. Now what I can do, you'll see that's updating on the interface as well. So if I go right forward here and I'm now in the folder called ride to work. Now if I just want to see what's in that folder without looking at the other two folders, if you just press source again it takes you inside just that folder. So you now see that I've got six or seven clips that are just inside that folder so it means that the scroll wheel and shutter wheel will behave slightly differently because there's less duration for it to go through. So that's a really cool little trick. Now if you want to come out of there just go to press escape and you're back interviewing all of your footage. Now to come out of there just press timeline and then if I press play now we're just playing our regular timeline. So this is an edit we're halfway through this edit so we can scroll through we can shuttle through this is really cool stuff and what I want to do is just place a marker. So let's just place a marker let's say here and to do that if you go to where it says audio level but if you double click it that adds a marker. Now if I just go forward a little bit more and if I double click it but this time I'm going to use the jog wheel to select a new color marker. So this is really good so you just double click and hold so let's put a purple one down and if I play that even further I say we want to put a marker here if I triple click up comes the marker dialogue box so what you can do now is either type in a new name or maybe I want to give it a marker duration or just add some notes so that's a really quick way of accessing markers but via the speed editor. Now when you're in jog mode if you press snap on here what happens is as you get to an edit point the jog wheel stops momentarily so you can see that I'm still moving the jog wheel but it's stuck on the edit point for me so it snaps to the edit point and it also snaps to markers so if I just go back a little bit more you see that I get a little bit of play in the jog wheel while it holds onto that marker so that's a really good way of just snapping to objects that you might want to. If I double click the snap and hold it the jog wheel actually updates my interface so I can make the screen larger or smaller just using the speed editor so again that's a really cool little trick there. The speed editor itself it runs off USB-C or Bluetooth now I've been using it for a few days now and I have no idea how long the battery's actually lasted on this because I haven't actually run them out yet so to check what the battery life is if you go to your preferences and if you go to your system and go to control panels you see the battery level there so I'm still at 79% so these have obviously got a healthy battery life on them. Try now press play. So if I wanted to add an edit point there what you can do is just press split and that puts an edit point in the point where you are so let me just go back and show you and they can see the split. Now if I go to snap mode and jog mode so I'm lined up on there now if I want to rejoin that split that I've made just press it again and there you see the splits has now become a join. If I just scroll back here to my title there if you press the title so if I double click here and hold what I can actually do is jog through all my different fonts so again this is a really quick way of just updating that one or just browsing what fonts you've got on your system and if I come further back here we've got some transitions here okay so what I can do is I can change the duration of those transitions by just pressing transition duration and then using my jog wheel. Now if I wanted to set that as the preset all I've got to do then is double click and that is now the new default transition preset. So just before we take a look at the speed editor in the color page please consider subscribing I haven't asked for quite a few episodes now and it would mean a lot to me if you would subscribe and hit the thumbs up for me let's go and take a look at the speed editor in the color page. So I'm going to switch to the color page and talk you through which functions work on here now obviously things like camera cutting and trimming and the actual editing functions are not going to work in the color page there's no reason for them to work in the color page but a fair few of the keys do actually work so straight away you've got your stop and play and your jog works over these that you've got the jog and shuttle and scroll they all work perfectly well and you also have in here the full view so I can go into full view and back again in and out work not quite sure what you need those for but they work anyway and also the split clip works so if you just wanted to split a clip maybe you wanted to do a cross dissolve on it to do two different color grades or you might have a shot where there is an edit that's not been detected if you've done scene cut detect for example then you can use the split so let me just show you that so if I just jog back a little bit phone split this clip here just press split and that's done and the undo feature works as well so if I just add a little bit of a grade and then I can just double click here and undo that the markers work as well so if I just play that through you can do a double click here to add a marker you can't do the marker select using the color wheel thing but you can triple click and bring up your marker dialogue box just press escape to get rid of that so obviously this is designed for the cut page and edit page this is mostly editing functionality but there are a few things in there that are just going to help you a little bit in the color page too you
