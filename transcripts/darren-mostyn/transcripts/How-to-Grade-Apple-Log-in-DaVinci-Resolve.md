Music So all the clips that you've just seen were shot admittedly badly by me on this. It's the iPhone 15 Pro. And the beauty of this camera is, I'm even calling it a camera, it's a phone, is that it shoots in Apple Log. So I can shoot ProRes 4K, super high quality video files, but in Apple Log. And this gives you a much more cinematic look when it's graded correctly. And version 18.6 of DaVinci Resolve now has an Apple Log color space profile in there. So I'm going to show you how to correctly apply it, what the correct settings are, what not to do, and let's go and take a look. So the first shot that we're looking at here is actually straight out of the phone. This is using the regular camera app that comes with the iPhone. And what happens is the iPhone processor does a lot of the heavy lifting here. So we don't actually have to grade this shot if we didn't want to. It's already got contrast in it. It's already looking colorful, the saturation added. It even uses clever processing to actually expose this bottom area more than it would the top area to give us a nice balanced look. But you tend to look quite like it's been shot on a phone. It looks a bit videoy. It tends to have over sharpening in it and just little things like that. So the Apple Log is allowing us to have that increased dynamic range and allows us to process the image, how we want to not have the Apple processor works. So let me show you that. Here's a log image. This is your Apple Log. And as you can see, we've got a very wide dynamic range to play with. And we can balance this shot up now and it's going to match professional cameras a lot better than using the straight Apple non log. So let me show you. I'm just going to put the grade on here. And we have a much more filmic looking look. So this clip is not only shot Apple Log, but I also use the Blackmagic Camera app. So it's a free app you can download from the Blackmagic website. And that app gives you far more control. You can lock your exposure, you can lock your shutter speed. And that's going to give you far better results than the automatic settings in the regular camera app. So I'm just going to quickly show you on my phone how to set up Apple Log. And we're going to come back here and I'm going to show you all the correct settings to get you footage looking absolutely gorgeous. So on your iPhone, you want to go to your settings and then you want to scroll down until you find the camera setting, switch on that. And then you'll see your video settings. You can be called at 4K HD, but also you've got formats. So if you press on formats, scroll all the way down to the bottom and you'll see their Apple ProRes. So you enable that and then ProRes encoding, you can select HDR, SDR and log. So log is the setting that we want to use. So now when you open up your camera app, your regular camera app, you'll see in the top you've got ProRes. It's disabled by default because obviously these are very high file sizes. And you'd literally just switch that on and you're ready to go. And you'll then see that the profile looks very flat. OK, so you're actually viewing it in the log profile. Now, if you're recording using the regular camera app on your iPhone, you can't regulate things like the shutter speed and the ISO. These things are constantly changing to give you the correct exposure. So what you can do is go to the app store and download the Blackmagic Camera app. It's completely free and install that. And this gives you much more control. So let's have a look. So the Blackmagic Camera app, let's open that up. I'm not going to do a detailed tour of this as many tutorials on YouTube that show you how to do this. But the takeaways for me, I can adjust the frames per second here. So let's put it up to 50. That also makes it just the shutter speed for me. So I'm going to get this really nice filmic look. These are all fixed. The white balance can be automatic, but as soon as you start recording, it locks it so you don't get that varying white balance. It's really smart to work with. You'll also notice I'm not seeing the log profile. This is going to record in log, but I've got a display look built into this that I've switched on. So this is going from Apple log to Rec. Seven and nine, giving me a much more realistic image while I'm out filming of what it's going to look like. You can also record directly onto a USB C drive. So I could take that, plug it into my grading suite and just start grading up footage. So that's fantastic. One thing to bear in mind with the Blackmagic Camera app with these professional video settings that are locked and going to give you that nice filmic look is as soon as you go outside, you're going to be so overexposed. You've got to get a cage on your phone and an ND filter. All right. So I've just got a little cage on here. It's really cheap. ND filter and you're good to go. The first thing we need to do is our color management as I do with all of my projects. And from 18.6, there is a built in Apple log profile. So I'm going to show you that in a moment. But first of all, I want to have a look and other way of how to color manage and that would be using LUTs. And the reason I'm talking about this is because the official Apple LUTs currently is sat behind a developer's wall. You can't actually access it unless you're an Apple developer. So I did a bit of rooting around on the internet and I found people have actually posted it in various places, but the true source of it, I don't actually know. And I'm just going to show you something so you don't make this mistake. So I've downloaded what's called the Apple official LUTs that goes from Apple log to req 709. I've installed it into my LUTs folder on DaVinci Resolve. I'm going to show you what happens. First thing I can do is right and click on here, go to LUTs and I've installed Apple log. And this is the first one that I found. OK, and that looks absolutely fine. And I've also found another one. So if I go in here, Apple log. And it looks completely different. I don't know which one is actually the correct one. So with that, I'm going to use the color space transforms, which we're going to show you in a moment. But let me just show you what that looks like on a grayscale ramp here. So typically what a LUT is going to do is take us from a scene referred space, a Ari log or Apple log, and it's going to take us into a display referred space. So that would be req 709, for example. And if the curve would look something like this, OK, what I've done here is just drawn a curve. It's exactly emulated on the waveform. So you can see what's going on. So I'm going to reset that. And I'm going to bring in a LUT. Now, the first thing I'm going to do is just bring in a classic Ari LUT. OK, this is the Ari Alexa log C to req 709 LUT. And you can see it's got a really nice shape on here. OK, you've got really nice lift here from the toe. And we're going up to the shoulder here. And it's just giving us a really nice. This is an absolute classic LUT. OK, so that's the Ari LUT. Now, let's have a look at what's happening with those LUTs that I downloaded from the Internet. So I'm going to right and click on here. I'm going to get to LUT. I'm going to Apple log. And the first one here, this is log to linear. So we don't want that one. We want Apple log to req 709. If I click on this one, we're getting a curve, which I'm expecting. So it's going to take us out of log and it's going to bring us into a req 709 ish color space. But look at the curve here. OK, so the toe here, we've got this big, long point here on the blacks until it actually starts lifting. So this is indicating to me that the blacks are going to be not crushed, but they're going to be sitting very low. And then when we come up to the top here, look at this, you've got this sort of weird jagged lines. I have no idea what that is supposed to be, but I don't like it. So what I'm going to do is use the other one. OK, and say conversion LUT Apple. Log to req 709 and we're getting a much nicer curve here. OK, so this one is probably more accurate, but I don't actually know. Now, what I do know is if I applied the color space transform from resolve, I get a very different look than that. So to get this correctly from Apple log to req 709, using the correct profile, I'm going to use a color space transform. So let's have a look at what that looks like on this ramp. So I'm going to go to my input gamma. I'm going to say Apple log. Well, let's have a look at the Arri log first. So Arri log C3, you get that classic curve. Now, let's just change that to Apple log. OK, I'm not going to go through all the other settings now. It's just to give you an idea, but the curve looks something like this. And actually, in the toe, we get quite a long shadow here before it kicks up. So that's a characteristic of this tone curve. So we need to bear that in mind. It means our blacks are going to be have to be probably quite lifted. So let's take a look at this color management on an image. So I'm going to check my settings here. I'm in DaVinci YRGB. I've got my timeline color space set to DaVinci wide gamma intermediate, as I always do. And my output color space is rec seven and nine gamma two point four. That's because this is what the delivery is. This is what my monitor is calibrated to. If your monitor is calibrated to two point two, then set that to two point two. What I'm going to do then is apply a color space transform. So click on here. And what we need to do is change our output gamma. This is going to be rec seven and nine gamma two point four and rec seven and nine. It's here. Our input gamma is going to be Apple log. That's not looking too bad. But if we set our correct timeline setting here to rec twenty twenty, we get a much better result. Now we're ready to start grading. So I want to grade underneath this. OK, I want to grade in the largest color space I possibly can. So if I press shift S, this will give me a node before. So what we can do now is just go in and literally start grading at the shot how we want. So we need to add a little bit of extra saturation, for example. And we're off. We're ready to grade. So we've got a really good starting point using our color space transforms. So some of you may have already downloaded my fixed notary. The link is in the description if you want to download that. But let me just show you how I would work with that. So I'm going to overwrite that. I'm going to middle mouse click. This is my fixed notary. So what this relies on is these are a lot of blank nodes with ideas of how we could grade this. At the end, we've got a color space transform going from Da Vinci wide gamut to Rick seven and nine gamma two point four. So what we need to do at the beginning, whenever you use this fixed notary, you just need to tell the first node which camera profile you're using or which log space you're in. So our input gamma will be Apple log. And our input color space, this looks pretty good, actually. But the input color space needs to be this is because it's using our timeline setting. So it's actually in Da Vinci wide gamut, which is a large color space. If you're in Rick seven and nine, this would look incorrect. So let me just show you that. If I get to Rick seven and nine. Doesn't look good. It's very desaturated here, as you can see. But if I go to Rick 20 20, which is the correct one, it looks much better. So now we're in a good starting point. So all the middle nodes here have no grade on. So this one balance and exposure. So let's just start playing around with that. We can go in here, add a little bit of contrast. I'm just doing this really quick. And let's put some saturation in there. So it's got our HDR wheels, maybe add some saturation like that. So this is how we're going to carry on grading. But the fact that we've set our color management correct is giving us this really nice starting point working with Apple log. This is going to balance really nicely now with black magic camera, with Canon, with Sony S log three, Ari, all those things because we've got the correct color profile on it. So if you want to do this using automatic color management, let's just get rid of all that. What you need to do is click in here, go to DaVinci YGV Color Managed. I would set the color processing mode to be HDR because you want to work in Rick 20 20, or you can go to the custom settings and put some more advanced settings in there. Apple color space, SDR Rick 709. Press save. And then all you've got to do is right click on here, go to input color space, choose Apple, Apple log. And there we go. That's our starting point. And you can just grade from there. So take a look at this video that's appearing here. If you want a more detailed breakdown of how I use that no tree, you can download it for free in the link in the description. And it really will take your grading to the next level. So I hope this has enlightened you on what to do and what not to do with Apple log. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
