So in this episode, I'm going to be looking at film emulation techniques and in particular the brand new DCTL from Stefan at mononodes.com He's just updated his film elements pack to 2.0 and this has finally got grain in it so I've been really looking forward to seeing what Stefan does with grain and I'm going to show you in this episode now there's 13 new elements. I'm not going to go through all 13 I'm going to pick my favorites. I've been playing with it for a few days I've tried it on lots of different footage and The results are amazing. Now. This is a paid DCTL if that's not of interest to you I suggest you watch some other videos or go and have a look at some of my playlist I'll put a link up here But if it is of interest to you I'm going to be showing you a special offer that Stefan's got running at the moment as well But just for transparency, I have not been paid to make this video. This is not a sponsored video I did however receive this pack for free But all the views in this are entirely my own Stefan has not had any say in what I'm doing in this video So let's go and take a look at the ones that I particularly like so I've got a project setup here already This has already been graded as I said, this is on the earth of 12k already graded I'm just going to add these extra elements from the DCTL so to install the DCTL I'll show you my project settings in here color management DaVinci YGB DaVinci wide gamma intermediate is our working color space and our output is Rex 709 gamma 2.4 to match my monitor as always and All I did was open the luck folder and install the DCTL pack into there Then when I select DCTL remember you need the full version of studio to run a DCTL Apply it on here and then I'll scroll down and you'll see you can see I've got loads of mononodes in here Anyway, I've used mononodes on all my work and if we go down here is our film elements now to select them from here This list is getting very long in here in this little DCTL list So what I've done is I've actually grabbed a still of each of the 13 elements in its default state So this allows me instead of having to scroll down that list It allows me to just simply grab from here So if I want to put a vignette on for example Drag and drop it on and I've kept them all in their default state so you can see what happens So let me show you my six favorite ones like I said, I've been playing with these for quite a few days now I've really tested it on different footage. This is 12k footage. Okay, the playback on these is fantastic So let's start with the dirt and it's called dirt head. So I'm gonna drag the hair I'm gonna drop it on this gives me the default setting for that I'm gonna press shift and F each time so you get a nice full screen and you can see what I'm playing with down here So let's play this through Okay, now it's hard to see any hair in there and that is because the hair is only gonna appear every now and again I've just saw one there and There it is and it looks absolutely great now if you want to set up the hair length and The you can do all of how frequent it runs all this is all listed down here frequency length Variation thickness blur. I'm not gonna read all these out. It's pretty obvious how it works But an easy way than having to find a frame to work on is you just say fill the screen with hair and you can even then put A gray background on so you can see what's going on this allows you to set up how you want that hair looking now I'm gonna zoom in because this the hair elements in here look really smart there There's not I've seen some hair where it's very pixelated and also you get a kind of glow around it There's all sorts of weird things happening. This is just really good organic care. It's been really well made so let me take the gray background off and Let me change that. Let me find a frame with some hair in it. There was one Right now you've got this really nice blend mode on it as well. So it looks really natural and that is here You can change to black hair as well with black hair. You really want to change this to be a multiply But I'm gonna choose the white hair here and that's it as good to go. It just looks fantastic So that is the hair option. I'm gonna show you the same dirt but with spots this time So I'm gonna overwrite that one you can obviously build these up together If you're doing that you want to put them in cereal don't put things like texture in as parallels You want this going as cereal now these are great. These look fantastic. Let me just play that through Yeah, you can just see them flicking on and off there Really cool really organic. They look really natural and you can change the colors You can have you can have black and white mixed and at the top here You'll see that you've got your frequencies for white and down here You've got your frequencies and your sizing and blurring all that for the black spots, but the shape of them is fantastic They're really very realistic looking So that says now you can again fill the screen and put the dirt on so you can play around with the sizing and how you want them to look And just show you we're getting real-time playback so it's 24 frames a second and it's playing back quite happily But man, this has already got a grade on it. So there's elements already in here I've even got mono-nose density going on on this shot as well. So it's playing back absolutely fine So the next one I want to show you is flicker. I really like how this one works I'm gonna go to this shot here for this one. I'm gonna drag and drop it on what it's doing It's probably easy to show you actually in here. There's a grayscale ramp Check your transfer function. By the way, this is it to Ari log C3 I want this to be DaVinci wide gamut intermediate, but there are many options in there and if I play this through you'll see What's happening? We're getting a really nice subtle flicker. So if I show you that on the image by shift F Let's take that off and press play Okay, it's pretty suck. These are really subtle when you go by default, but actually I like that I don't want them to be hard, but I'm just gonna increase it a little bit so you can see what's going on Okay, you can just see that flickering going on there Really subtle, but it's really great effects. I've not seen anyone do that that well actually and if you go to the mononose.com Website there is a full list in there of exactly what these are doing what each one's doing I don't want to sit here and show you 13 different film elements. We've got grain. I'm gonna save that for the end This is my favorite one and another one of my favorites obviously halation Let's have a look at what halation is doing. So drag and drop that on. Let's go to our full screen mode Remember the transfer function is changing here is defaulting to arry log C3 We're in DaVinci where I go into media. So make sure you're in the right one. This is pretty obvious This is giving us really subtle halation straight away. I don't actually need to change anything in here But let me show you on and off There's a lot it's probably actually that is quite heavy So I could either do a global blend back or We can just pull the size down and maybe lift the threshold up So it takes a little bit longer to kick in but that is giving us really really clean lovely halation So the next one I want to show you before I show you grain is MTF now just before I show you that I want to share with you a special offer that Stefan's offering until the first of November 2025 I should state because I might leave this video up longer than that but there is a hundred euros off the price of the film elements 2.0 and That is only till first of November 2025. So the pack has just been released So grab it quick and if you want an extra 10% off that if you put the code Darren at checkout You'll get 100 euros plus 10% and the 10% is all year round So any mononodes.com you can apply the code Darren at checkout and all year round you get 10% off any of those DCTL's right. Let's get on with it. So I'm gonna drag the MTF on now What an MTF is this is emulating our with film the characteristic is areas of very high frequency tend to get softened a little bit and I'm talking about things like hair. We're looking at areas with sharp edges Paws things like that. Just sort of fine frequency areas tend to get softened. So this tool allows us to emulate that Now, how do we gonna do that? Let's have a look at the MTF checker put that on there is nothing on by default So what you need to do is use these these sliders that you got fine detail small detail and coarse detail Moving to the left softens me to the right will sharpen those textures and Fine being our high frequencies. So what I'm gonna do is bring that down because I want to soften these and Just to highlight it. I'm gonna make my course detail a little bit sharper So this is what's been affected. So particularly around here is where we're gonna get our biggest Effect so I'm gonna take that off I'm gonna zoom now you've got to zoom right in this is a really subtle effect What we're trying to do is soften but not make the image look out of focus It's not like a blur. So let me just enable and disable that you can just see that happening on the eyelashes there So we're not blurring. We're just softening off the frequency areas And that is great now look at the pause even as well. I hope that's coming across on YouTube I'm just gonna exaggerate a little bit more just so you can see it But this is this is just fantastic MTF now to set this up manually is quite a lot work So the fact we've now got a DCTL to do it is great. So the last few in here We've got reframe vignette edge vignetting. We've got a chromatic aberration here the reframe by the way just does output blanking but it's got a few more options and yet with the Vinty Resolve and Don't spots have shown you but I've saved the best or last this is fantastic. This is the best grain I've used to date This is I'm just wow. I'll just show you. I'm gonna drag and drop it on Let's go full screen. I didn't need to do anything. It looks fantastic. Oh, I do need to change the transfer function And I play that through obviously you need to play grain and I'm still getting real-time playback here I've got other grading elements already on this. This is the full grade and Just looks great. Let me show you on a grayscale. Let's see what's going on And obviously I do have options to change things in here So for example taking a bit of grain out the shadows is normally quite nice to do I'm gonna take that off Let me zoom in so you can see what's going on and Also with this grain when you change your timeline resolution the grain will transfer correctly So if you're working in HD or 4k, it will look correct I'm just gonna play this clip back a few times and just show you how organic it looks some of the grains I've worked with look like they're literally sat on top of the image like an overlay This one really feels like it's part of the subject Let me just show you quickly how I would apply a few together So let's start with that grain now the grain you could technically put this at the front of the operation I tend to work it at the back, but try they have a little play around see what you think I'm gonna do option s and add another node and let's put a bit of relation on there. Why not? Again, I'm gonna ask my full screen Let's just make sure that's on DaVinci wide gamma This is what's a good idea to make these as presets actually I should have changed them to DaVinci wide gamma when I saved it as a preset still that would be a good idea I'm gonna do that when I finish this episode and So there's my head relation and Then you put as many of these on as you want Then all you got to do if you want to is highlight them together right click and you can say create compound node and this can be my film Elements then to go in there and edit any of that right and click and just say show compound node And there's my film and links so I'm sure you'll agree with me This is a really well crafted DCTL Stefan seven apps that you fantastic job on this Don't forget you get 100 euros off until the first of November 2025 You get an additional 10% of that as well if you put the code Darren at checkout If you're watching this after November the first you can apply the code Darren at checkout to get 10% off Any of the DCTLs at mononodes.com? I'd say thanks to Team 2 films for the footage and I really can't wait to get playing with I can't wait to put that grain on an actual project look after yourselves and I see you the next episode
