So I've got DaVinci Resolve running on my iPad. It's running like a dream and whilst it's the full cut page and color page from the full Version there are a few little things that are slightly different because it's on an iPad So in this episode I want to show you what they are how to get running on your iPad super quick and enjoying Resolve so let's go and take a look So DaVinci Resolve on the iPad. I've got the 11 inch M1 model here So it's slightly older, but I promise you DaVinci Resolve is absolutely flying on this thing I've got a couple of extra peripherals as well here with me. I've got the speed editor So this is obviously Bluetooth connecting to DaVinci Resolve working beautifully on the iPad I've got a little SSD drive here because I've not got much internal storage on here So USB-C connects straight into the side of the iPad. I've got the Apple pencil This is working really well with DaVinci Resolve as well. Obviously you can use your finger as well but I tend to use the pencil and I've also got the dedicated keyboard and trackpad that comes for iPad I have tested it with my MX keys Bluetooth. It works great So the first thing you're gonna notice is you've only got the cut page and the color page But this is no problem because they are the full feature set So you're gonna have full non-linear editing with full beautiful color grading and color management Everything that you're used to is in there So if I go to here and because the color management you've got all the settings in there that you're gonna need for all your projects So it's not been de-featured in any way You just haven't got the Fusion page and you haven't got the Fairlight page So let's start on the cut page now the first thing it took me a little while to work out is how to actually right-click How'd you actually get anything into the system? So you need to right-click and say import on your media page now to right-click hold your finger down Just for longer than a moment and then you'll see your right-click. So let me do that with the pencil And there you go. So it's not that long people are saying it's a little bit laggy But you get really used to it doesn't bother me at all. There's no menu. So you don't have your traditional menus These are obviously allowing you to make your GUI however you want it But down here you do have undo redo and delete. So let's have a look at the transitions and if I click in here and You've got all the transitions that you're used to so let me just grab a classic cross dissolve Drag and drop that on into the center and that's good to go. So you can edit the duration with your finger I can use the pencil here and One thing I wanted to do was set my I set my default duration to much less than one second So if I click on that go to my inspector, I couldn't find where it was But I found it now and if I click in here and make that I want to make that 12 frames You see you get this nice box comes up and you merit keypad box I'll make that 12 frames set as default duration. So that is now my default So you'll find it in the inspector some of the things that were in menus are now in the inspector So you've got the voice isolation is in there as well now So one thing I always found useful with a cut page was reformatting for TikTok Instagram YouTube shorts That sort of thing because it had the 9 by 16 mode now in the version 18.1 They've introduced that at timeline level. So if we click on our master settings up here We can say use vertical resolution Say save and if I go to the end of my timeline, I've got a shot of me vlogging And if I click on that image what I can do now is zoom in Okay, and I'm just gonna offset that a little bit I'm gonna make it a little bit wonky and what I want to do is get to DaVinci resolve to actually reframe that automatically for me So we've got smart reframe here. This has been in there for a while But I just want to show you the speed that it's doing it. So I'm gonna press reframe What it's doing now, it's gonna centralize that clip as best fit for that portrait mode and we can just play that back Look how fast it did that now if you have two people talking on here It will automatically reframe to the person who is talking at that moment. So it's really cool Okay, so let's switch that back to regular mode So I'm just working in 1920 by 1080 here and let's come off that unfortunate shot So let's switch to the color page. So in here, I've got a few nodes going on here I want to add another serial node You just click up here and this is actually a pull down menu So you'll see as I right-click you've got add serial add parallel add layer You can right-click on these nodes to bring up various things if I want to label that node node label There's a keypad icon appears here. If you don't have a keyboard attached So you can just type in here Exposure for example, if I want to grab a still of this just right-hand click in here grab still that's done So that's your gallery we can switch the gallery on and off and you've got the full feature set in here So you've got HDR tools you've got all your curves Everything is in here and one nice thing on here if you're playing around So let's say we just do a little bit of offset on here if you want to adjust temperature We can literally slide or you can double-click and actually type in a value now Obviously, there's no menus at the top. So if you want to do things like output blanking You'll find that in another mode. So if I click on this shot here Just so you can see what's going on and if we go into our resizing and We switched to output sizing then you see here you've got your blanking So if you want to put blanking on that note on top you can add that in there and Obviously if you're bringing this from a project from a full version of resolve, this is where it would recognize those settings Now because we've gone to output sizing we're in clip versus timeline mode So we're now in timeline mode. So how do we switch that back to clips? Well, that's up here Again, it's pulled our menu and obviously if you're doing grouping you would multiple select clips right and click And then you say add into a new group and then your grouping would appear in that menu as well The only thing I found that's missing is light box So I'm hoping they bring that in in a future version because I do love light box all your effects are in here So remember let's just add an effect. Maybe what we've got going on here. I've got contrast pop in here Okay, so I tell you what we do. Let's utilize some old keyboard shortcuts So shift and F gives you a really nice Size for the GUI for seeing your image and gives you all the controls you need for contrast pop So you want to revisit those because you're working on an iPad So shift F that is and command F will give you full screen mode And the quality of the image in reference mode on the 12.9 inch iPad is fantastic So let's get rid of our effects. Let's have a look at the lutz You've got all the built-in lutz that you'd expect if you want to bring in your own lutz You need to access the actual file. So if you click in here go to files Go to DaVinci Resolve and you'll see in there There's a lutz folder so you can let you drag and drop your lutz into there and they will then appear in DaVinci Resolve The other thing that's in a different menu if you click here You've got your image wipe split screen and highlights as three different toggles So if I go to highlight mode, then you see your different highlight modes down here So that's now in a pull-down menu switching between timeline and clips is here And then when you're ready to export set the setting that you want it to be so if you want to be ultra HD Just pull it down here. Let's do that and Then all you got to do press export and that is now set to 3840 by 2160 choose which render engine you want so if we want pro res the M2 iPads I have a Pro res optimization for the pro res engine there So it really flies or you can go straight up to your YouTube channel or whatever you want to do So if you're used to working in the edit page and you want to know a bit more about how to use the cut page properly Check out this video here. Enjoy using your iPad. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode
