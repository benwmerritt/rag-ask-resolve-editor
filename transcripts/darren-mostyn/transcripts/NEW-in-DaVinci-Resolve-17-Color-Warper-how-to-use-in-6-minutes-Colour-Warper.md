## Transcript
In this episode I want to show you some of my favorite things in the color page. So let's go and have a look. So this is the color warper. This is probably my favorite new tool in version 17 and let's have a look how it works. So I'm going to expand it first. So I've got a nice enlarged view to work with. And the first thing you need to do is determine the behavior of the color warper by selecting which color space you're going to work in. So I'm going to choose HSL and you've got this grid. So going round is hue and from the center outwards is saturation. So it's hue saturation. And just to show that if I grab a point here you'll see that all the blues start getting desaturated. Bring that back and they're saturated again and then if I go round you'll see that we're changing the hue. So really easy to do. Let's just reset that. So instead of working on the graph we can actually work on the image. So I'm going to take the grass here and I'm just going to push it towards the left to increase saturation. And the nice thing with color warpers you get a really clean look. There's no noise or anything in here because you've got a really nice broad range and these lines are really smooth. It's kind of got an organic feel. So it's really intuitive. I'm literally just pushing that and the saturation is just falling into place there. If I do the sky I'm just going to push that. I don't want to push it up. That's hue. Sorry. So I'm going to push it towards the saturation there. In fact let's just change its hue a little bit. So there you've got really nice clean sky and clean grass. So the range that is being selected is determined by how many points we have on this graph. So we've got six of these stems if you like. I don't know the actual name for them but I'm going to call them stems. And you've got six points of saturation to deal with. So as I make a move it's being divided by six if you like. So down here we can control that. So this side is the hue and this side is the saturation. And we can go up to 24 points. So there's 12 for example. You can actually have them running independent as well. So let's say you want tighter control over the hue but a bit less on the saturation. You can separate them out like that. So this will give me a broader scope for saturation and tighter control over the hue. So let's say for example like if you look at this grass here there's two different shades going on here. So let's maybe make this one a bit more green. It looks a little bit barren. And so I'm going to up this to 16 actually just make it a little bit tighter. And click on here. I'm going to change the hue, put it around and the saturation. And there that's got that a little bit better matched. Let's just change the hue a little bit more like so. So on this shot here we can see that the sky is more saturated here than it is here. And I can use the pinning function which is here to help me match those better. So I'm going to up the number of points that we have. Let's up it to 12. Let's try that. What I want to do is have a look at where this is on the graph. So I can see that quite clearly now. And I'm going to pin these points so that they don't move. So if I take this tool here I can actually draw and select a number of points. And now if I press this it will convert those points to pins. And what this does now is allow me to come over here, go back to my tool. And as I push this towards saturation you see that I'm pinning this. So this doesn't move but this does. This area is getting more saturated. So this helps me balance that sky quite easily. And just to make it a little bit smoother I'm going to unpin this one by control clicking and maybe this one as well just so it's a little bit smoother between the two. So I'm just going to desaturate this green area a little bit. And I'm going to choose a point and what I'm going to do is press command and I'm going to select multiple points. So you can see that we've got now two points selected. And if I want to desaturate them I'm just going to pull them down slightly and here maybe just bring the hue round this way a little bit. So that's using multiple points. Now what I could do is use this feathering here to tweak that back a bit. So if I think I've gone a bit too desaturated what I can do is press saturation. And each time I press this it goes one step closer to where it was originally. So this one does the hue and this one does the saturation. So you can sort of add a fair bit and then smooth it back again using these feathering tools. And you can use your control key to delete points. So I'll reset it back. And if you press your shift key you lock in saturation. So basically you're just affecting hue. And if you press your alt key and select a point you'll see the range that's being selected. So if you're enjoying this content so far hit the subscription button and drop me a comment and have a look at my other episodes even though they're version 16 there's some very relevant information in there. And let's get on with the rest of this episode. So that's the hue saturation there's also in here chroma luma. So we've got two grids here grid one is this side and grid two is this side. So you select which one you want to affect. And what you've basically got is brightness luminance and we've got color shift. So basically you're going towards yellow and blue and green and magenta. Now this is in HSL so be aware that there are other color spaces. So let's just up the grid let's put on to 12 and basically if I take the sky here and I want to lift it up I just push upwards to brighten it. And if I push to the right it will get cooler and if I push to the left it gets warmer. And if I select a different grid we can do the same with the greens. So let's take our green here make it brighter push it towards green this way. And you see what's happening is it affects the whole grid. So when I make these movements let me just change back to grid one the whole grid is being moved. So what it's a good idea to think about is locking points. Now you can either use the draw tool and draw the points like we did earlier or we can use this thing called auto lock. So what that does is it automatically locks points either side of the point that you're selecting. So in this case it will lock one point either side. So let me just grab this guy. So you can see I'm only moving one column here. So let me reset that and set that to two points and now you see the point I grab has been locked two points either side. Now this is because column is selected so I'm just going to reset that. Now if I set this to be row it does the same but not for brightness but for the color shift. So you can see there I'm locked two points either side. So without the auto lock on it moves the whole grid and then use the auto lock to select columns rows or this one is column and row. So basically what you get now let me just reset that is we're going to have two points either side of the point that we select locked. So you're just controlling the region of interest a little bit better. You can also select range here. Let's set the auto lock off. So after now selected three columns and we can just move that up and down quite easily. So the color warper really is going to change the way that you do color grading. It's a really organic tool. It gives a really pleasing look and it's very simple to use. So I hope you've enjoyed this quick insight into the color warper and enjoy using Resolve 17.
