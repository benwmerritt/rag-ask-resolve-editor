Device rendering, transform, DRTs, what on earth are these? I'm going to demystify that for you in this episode. Everyone's talking about them on YouTube and with very good reason. Now I've changed my DRT workflow in the last few months, particularly on the last few broadcast jobs that I've done, I've changed my workflow. So I'm going to share that with you in this episode and explain exactly what I'm doing. But first I'm going to explain what is a DRT, how to install them, where to get them from, what are they doing, and I'm going to show you four different DRTs across four different shots. Now I've got a test chart in here, I've got some indoor footage, some exterior footage and some night footage. And it's really important when you're changing your workflow that you test this on various types of footage just to check that your workflow is not going to break. So I've done that research for you, I've got a new one that I'm just trying out as well. I'm going to share that with you in this journey. Now if you're a bit more advanced and you know what a DRT is and you know how to install them, use the timestamps below and just fast forward the first sort of five minutes or so and do something more quality with your life than watching how to do that. All right, so let's start off, what is a DRT? A DRT is part of color management. So it's the end part of the process when we take a color managed image, usually in a wide color space, something like DaVinci wide gamut and we make it look correct on your display. So we're bringing it down to Rec 709, gamma 2.4, in my example 2.2, P3, something like that. So it's taking in that large working color space and it's the end of the color management pipeline where we bring that large working space down to display space. That's all a DRT is doing, device rendering transform. Now, why these are popular at the minute is because third party developers are creating their own. The DRT that you've seen me use for a couple of years or longer is my CST. It's my end CST in my no tree. That is a DRT, it's a device rendering transform. It just happens to be called color space transform in DaVinci Resolve. Now, third party developers are creating their own and I'm gonna look at three third party ones and compare them with the DaVinci Resolve color space transform that you're used to seeing me use. So these are the four images that I've got in here. I've got this Arri test chart, this is Arri Luxe 4. I've got this which is shot on red. I've got this shot here which is black magic design and I've got this shot here which is shot at night Sony S-Log 3. So we've got three different flavors of footage, four different flavors of footage in here. Now what's important when you're using new DRTs is that you test them and I've done extensive testing for months on these DRTs before I committed to using them actually on a broadcast job. And my last two jobs at least have been with third party DRTs. So let me show you what's going on here. I've got a very, very simple no tree here. This is our Arri Luxe 4 with a color space transform on it going from Arri Wide Gamut, Arri Luxe 4 to DaVinci Wide Gamut, DaVinci Intermediate. This is my classic workflow that I've been using for years. If you don't understand that, I'll put a link to it in the description. You want to look at something like My Best No Tree or how to use CSTs in color management. Up here we've got three blank nodes. This is where I would do my grading. So once I'm in that large color space up here, then I start doing my grading. And at the end, what I want to see is what I'm seeing on my display. I can't see DaVinci Wide Gamut on my display. There's no such thing. It doesn't show me that wide color space. So what I need to do is use a device rendering transform, DRT, to bring that large space down to Rec 709. So to do that, the first DRT I'm using is called Color Space Transform. And you've seen me do this for years on YouTube. I'm going to go from DaVinci Wide Gamut and I'm going to go DaVinci Intermediate because that is what's being fed from this node here. And my output color space wants to match my monitor, currently set to Rec 709, Gamma 2.4. That is a DRT. Now the new third party DCTLs that are coming in have been designed by Color Scientist and they do a fantastic job of doing exactly what that CST is doing. But sometimes they do an even better job than that CST. Now I wouldn't say one fits all. I try various ones on various projects just to see which one I prefer. But you do get more pleasing results in certain scenarios. I'm going to show you exactly why that's happening in here. Now if you want to use a DRT from a third party developer, you're going to need to have access to what's called DCTL. So in my library here is a thing called DCTL. And if I drag and drop that on, you then in this list have a list of all the DCTLs that I've bought. So DCTLs are allowing third party developers to write their own code and access the tools within DaVinci Resolve. And what some of these Color Scientist are doing is creating fantastic DRTs. So the three that I'm going to look at today is one called JP2499. There's one called Print DCTL, which is from Mononodes. And I'm going to look at another one, which is newly introduced to me called Open DRT. Now to install these into DaVinci Resolve, you need to go to your project settings. If you go to your color management, and down here you'll see under lookup tables, a open LUT folder. Also just bear in mind, your 3D lookup table interpolation should be set to tetrahedral. It's probably set to trial linear as default. So if it's a tetrahedral, you're going to get better quality. Now when you press open LUT folder, it will take you straight to the directory that you need to install the DCTL. Now the DCTL, you've probably downloaded it from a website. You might have gone to GitHub. I'm going to put links to the three DCTLs that I'm using in the description, and you basically put them straight into that folder. And you see the ones that I've got are installed in here already. So there's JP2499 DRT. I've got my Mononodes LLP. It's called Look Lab Print. That's the one you need to download from the Mononodes site. And it's actually a full look development tool, but I'm just using the print element of it in this exercise. I'll show you exactly what I'm doing. And I've also got another one here, open DRT.DCTL. Then you go back to resolve, which you put them into that folder, and you need to press here, update lists, and just restart the Vintage Resolve, and they will appear in that list. So for example, if I want to go in here and put on the JP2499, just click it on here. Now I'm going to go in and explain exactly what that's doing in a minute. So just don't worry just yet. All right, so that's how they work. Let's put that back to being a resolve CST. Now what I've done is I've created four single nodes here that have got these settings on already by default. So it means I don't have to keep pulling down that DCTL menu. So let's go back to the resolve CST. I'm going to put it on. And you see here, I've got Vintage Wide Gamma, Rx79 Gamma 2.4. Now the reason these third-party ones are so useful is because I get asked this a lot on my channel as well, is what is this tone mapping stuff? So once you apply a CST, you've got to start messing around with this tone mapping and people get a bit confused. This bit's pretty straightforward. We know we're going from DaVinci Wide Gamma to Rx79. But what tone mapping do I use? I've got so many different options in here and they all do a different thing to the image. So by default set to DaVinci, then I use this checkbox and I set this up to 10,000. And there's another option down here called saturation compression. Now depending which footage I'm using depends how the image looks. So I've got many different options in there and it can get quite confusing. What I like with the custom DCTLs that people are making, the custom DRTs, is they get rid of this tone mapping. They do give you other options. And what I want to do in this episode as well is show you the different options that are available in the different DCTLs. But this is an area of confusion. Often I have to change this during the project as well. What I want to be able to do is put a DRT on the end and just leave it. So let's have a look at what's happening. So we've got our regular CST. This is what we're used to and this is giving us a really good image. Skin tones are looking great. As you'd expect, it's an Arri test chart. So they should look good. Let's put on the first one. This is JP2499. Now I'm not going to grab it from here. I'm going to do it as a DCTL just to show you first of all how to do it. So let's just grab our DCTL. That's overridden my CST. And I go down here and in my list is JP2499. This is a free DRT available from Juan Pablo Zambrano's GitHub site. I'll put a link to it in the description. Now I've been using this one for quite a few months. I love what it's doing, but it does have quite a look. So I'm going to compare these for you and show you what's going on. The first thing it's doing is getting rid of me having to worry about that tone mapping. It's doing it all for me. It does a fantastic job, often better than the inbuilt Resolve CST. Down here, we've got various options. So we can rotate hue. We can rotate the highlights hue. We've got parity. We've got all these different sliders, but I don't actually know. I do know what they're doing, but let's imagine I don't know what they're doing. You're looking at those sliders going, I have no idea what's going on. This DRT is going to be a great starting point just by simply placing it on. Only thing you've got to do is check your input. So we've got DaVinci Wide Gamut, DaVinci Intermediate, and our output, Rec79 Power 2.4 or 2.2, whatever you want to choose, all right? So I'm going 2.4. That's all you need to do. You just drop it on and start working. It gives fantastic results. I'm going to show you the three separate images and show you exactly what it's doing. So the next DRT I'm going to use is from mononodes. It's called LookLab Print. And I'm just using the print element of it. Since version three of LookLab Print, it's changed the way it works. And it's really fantastic for me to use as an end DRT only because I do a lot of my film emulation in the Hansa, for example, but you do get all the film emulation tools built into it. So if you don't have the Hansa, this is actually a really good choice. So let's have a look at that one. So it's mononodes and it's called LookLab Print. And I just want to, you got LookLab Look Print and I want to take the print element of it. Now by default, you get this really strong look and that's because it applies the Kodak 2383 lookup table that I use a lot in my work as you know I do. So I need to change that. I wanted to just take it off. I'm going to take off the look here. And just while it's on, let me show you, you can actually dial back the amount of color with that look and you can dial back the amount of luminosity. So if I actually set that to back to zero, we've effectively taken that LUT off, but we can also just take it off here. And it's using the inbuilt LUTs that are built into DaVinci Resolve and it's doing them in a fantastic way. So you don't have to change it to Cineon Film Log and all that stuff. It really is a great tool. Now it still looks a bit weird and that's because our input needs to be set to DaVinci Wide Gamut. Output set to Recton 9 Gamut 2.4. Here's all the different film looks that you can have and obviously I've switched those off. And you can also play around with the shadow. So the tones and the shadow as well. I'm going to take that off. I just want it straight. I do all that stuff myself on a separate node. I just want my end DRT, my DRT to just behave as a way of coming from large color space to Recton 9 in a nice clean way with all really nice tone mapping. That's what I'm trying to achieve. This looks fantastic. So this is great straight off. Now the next one I'm going to show you is open DRT. Now I've only just been introduced to this. This is done by a developer called Jed Smith. And I've heard about it, but I haven't actually seen it. And Cullen Kelly did a YouTube episode a few weeks ago where he explained how open DRT works. So I thought I'd download it and have a look. So this is the only one I've not really tested extensively. The other two I've been working with for months. So I have really power tested it. I know it works. I'm not going to start a broadcast project with a DRT that I've not tested. So I'm kind of doing open DRT live for you. But I just want to give a shout out to Cullen Kelly for introducing me to it. Check out his channel. I'll put some links to those episodes in the description as well. And he goes into it much deeper than I'm going to. I'm literally going to give you a comparison. I'm going to give you my thoughts on these DRTs and just show you practically what's happening in with the tools that I've got here. So check that out. But it's by Jed Smith. It's on his GitHub site. It's another free DRT and let's go and apply it. So open DRT and on it goes. Now it says JP2499 here, but it's not. It's open DRT. We can see that here. And what this one does is give you quite a strong look to start with. So we're getting our wide color space down to our Rec 709. But Jed's DRT here actually gives it quite a distinct look. It's quite contrasty. Let me compare that to Resolve CST. So that's the regular Resolve CST that I'm used to seeing. This is open DRT. And so you can see we get quite a lot of contrast in there. You can override that using these settings here. Okay, so we've got different settings here. You'd have to worry about tone mapping or anything like that. You can basically go to these look presets. This is the default one, which is quite high contrast. And if I get to base, I can actually take all that look off. So again, it's still got quite a distinct look, but it's doing a very good job of mapping everything correctly to Rec 709. All right, so that's an introduction to the four DRTs that I'm going to be working with. Let's have a look at it on real world examples. So the first one I want to look at is this one here. This is our interior shot. This is shot with red. So I've got my first CST here going from red, wide gamut, red log 3G 10 to DaVinci wide gamut. That's all I want to do. Now I'm going to take the tone mapping off here at the beginning and I've done a little bit, not a lot, but I've done a little bit of grade on here just to brighten the image up a little bit. So it was there. I've just put a little bit of stuff, nothing too heavy because I don't want to detract from what the actual DRT is doing. All right, let's take our first one. This is CST. This is DaVinci Resolve regular color space transform that we're used to. This is a DRT. I've set it to DaVinci and I've got saturation compression on here. Let's have a look at what happens if I go to Luminance Mapping. You see that what's happening with this light changes quite dramatically and the candle up here. So the Luminance Mapping is trying its best to tone map that correctly for me. Let's try it on DaVinci. So they're both good. I actually prefer the DaVinci look in here, but often I'll have Luminance Mapping set on as a preset. So then I've got to try and get that looking correct. This is why I'm moving away from using color space transform as my end DRT. I still use color space transform at the beginning to get me to DaVinci wide gamut, but I'm changing how I work at the end. Let's have a look at the JP2419. I can see what that does. So I'm gonna drag and drop it on and there it goes. So just by default, I'm not changing any of the settings at all and we get a really nice look. The way that it's handling the Luminance in this light and this candle is really pleasing. You do get quite a warm look on it. So if we look again, let's just have a look at with the Resolve CST on it. If you look at the vectorscope here, it's all pretty even on that line. When we apply JP2419, the spread comes out. You get a lot more warmth in the image, okay? But it's got a kind of hue shift going on here as well. The reds are changing. Again, let's put the CST back on and then go to JP2419, have a look at the red wall at the background. You get a big shift in that red. That is nice. I like what it's doing. It's a good look, but it is quite a distinct look in there. All right, let's have a look what's happening when I apply mononodes. I'm just gonna drag and drop it on here for speed. So there's mononodes. Now, again, we're getting really nice toe mapping in our highlights here. These are very high highlights. And you can see that up here. These are almost hitting 1023 on my chart. And the candle, again, the toe mapping's been handled really nicely with the mononodes. Again, I've just taken the defaults, but I have saved this one with that LUT off. I'm not gonna want this LUT on because I'm using other things for my film emulation. All right, let's have a look what's happening with OpenDLT. So let's drag and drop that on. So OpenDLT, again, we're getting this quite strong look. So let's bring it down to base level. Okay, that strong look by default is a little bit too strong for me. But if we bring it down to base level, we can see a bit more what's going on. So it's handling the highlights well. Maybe a little bit out there. But let's have a look at that compared to a CST. Okay, yeah, it's a little bit clipping on there. So let's have a look at, so JP2499 again. Here's mononodes and here's OpenDLT and I'll set that down to base level. Okay, let's have a look at that now on an exterior shot. So this is Blackmagic Design. This is their footage. You can download this footage for free from the Blackmagic website. Okay, so what I've got on it in a minute, let's put the Resolve CST on there. So we can look at our default starting point. This is what we've been used to using for a couple of years now. Really nice. Again, I've done a little bit of a gradient here, but nothing heavy. I'm just boosting the shot a little bit, which helps us see what's happening with the DRT. So let's have a look what happens when we put JP2499 on. Let's drag and drop that on. And immediately I noticed that the sky, the hue in the sky changes. Now that is because in here, the overall rotation hue in here, if you look at blue, has actually by default got a hue shift of 0.23. Now if I put that back to zero, you see that sky goes back to the same color it was in the CST. So the JP2499 DRT has quite an inherent look built into it, but often that is pleasing. Now I can do that on my own manually as part of my color grade. So it doesn't really worry me too much, but just be aware there is quite a shift in there. All right, let's go back to our regular CST so we can reset our eyes. I'm gonna put the mononodes print. This is from the Look Lab print. I think it's Lab Look print, but whichever way. And drag and drop that on. And again, we get a very similar look to the regular CST that we're using, that we're used to. And that's a great starting point. Nothing wrong with that at all. So our whites are staying good. The tues and everything are staying natural, they're staying as intended. And let's have a look at the open DRT once. I'm just gonna reset that to the regular CST. Let's have a look at Jed's open DRT. Drag and drop that on. And as predicted, we get that contrasty look. We get a nice shift in the sky. But again, this is the sort of thing that I would want to do in the grade process as opposed to maybe as a DRT, but it is giving really great images here. Let's have a look at that at base level again. I should have saved that as a default. And there we go. So we're getting nothing to worry about there. That's a really good DRT taken us from wide color space to Rec 709, gamma 2.4. So before we test these DRTs on the night shot, let's just have a look at them side by side on this shot. Now what I've done is I've pre-made some stills here. So these are our four different DRTs. What we're getting out is our CST with our JP2499, mononodes and open DRT. So if you find this information useful, please think about subscribing. It takes a long time to prepare these episodes and it really is appreciated. So let's quickly take a look at the individual properties of these DRTs. I'm not gonna go into too much depth, but I just want to show you what sort of control you do have. So regular CST here, we've obviously got to mess around with our tone mapping and our saturation compression, all these different types of things. We've already looked at that and this is where it gets quite tricky. Let's put the JP2499 on. Okay, very simple controls. Most of this look we're getting is because of this overall rotation hue. We've already looked at that. So the blue is already rotated. If we reset that, then of course, we get rid of that blue cast that's going on in there. So you could set all these to zero. The highlight rotation here is allowing us to adjust our sort of white point. So how cool or warm the whites are looking. And your purity down here, I'm not exactly sure what it's exactly doing, but if I press this, it's kind of like saturation and contrast. So in the blues there, so you've got control over that as well. The beauty of this, it's nice and simple, just drop it on. All right, mono nodes. Let's have a look at the print section of mono nodes. Now, what this is doing is a straight DRT. No sliders needed at all. The sliders are only for when you've got apply-lut or apply-shadows on. So by default, I take those off. I'm just working with it absolutely straight and I know that I'm getting fantastic transformation from my large color space to my Rec.709. However, if I do want to put those on, let's apply the LUT and the shadows will just show you what they're doing. So this is applying now the Kodak 2383 D55 LUT. Now that is quite a warm look. If I go to D65, you see that my white point changes. So you've got control over the color temperature as well. And you can just dial in as much of this LUT as you want. All right, this will give you a really good starting point for getting a really good film emulation going on here. All right, and then the shadow slider, the amount of shadow and then the color that you're working with, the RGB in the shadows is adjusted here. You could just have the LUT if you want to take the shadows off but what I like with the mononodes is and with all of the mononodes, they're always really simple operations. It's really simple sliders keeping things nice and straight. I don't want to think too much about this. I just want to apply these DRTs and crack on with my work. All right, let's have a look at JED's open DRT one. Let's click on here. Again, nice and simple, some HDR settings in here. Our input gamma, DaVinci wide gamma, our input transfer, DaVinci intermediate, obviously we need to set that correctly. Our look preset by default is giving us these tone scale presets here. So we look in here, you've got high contrast. This is the default one it's set to. And then there's a few others in here. So we can have a look at these different tones going on and they each give us a very different look. Now the other thing you can do is change the creative white point. So if you want a different, if you want a warmer, you go to D50 and if you want cooler, you go to D65. And that's a really good setting to have. So the final image I want to show you is a night shot with lots of lighting going on. Now this is one of the hardest things for DRTs to handle. And well, let's just go and have a look at a practical example of this. So this is from an actual job I graded and have worked on. And we've got our regular CST going on here to start with. So without the DRT, we're obviously in our DaVinci wide gamut. This is shot Sony S-Log3, just so you know what we've got going on here. I've got no tone mapping going on at the beginning, which is how I'd like to set it. Let's have a look at what's happening with the CST. So this is regular DaVinci Resolve. And you can see it's handling it really well. If we look at these neons here, this is where a lot of DRTs struggle. This is where you've got to play with this tone mapping stuff. And this is where people get confused. So let's try it with luminance mapping on. Now with the luminance mapping on, we get a much more accurate representation of what these lights should look like. Keep an eye on the blues down here as well when we're comparing and this signage here. And also the yellow in here, how natural it's looking. So that's a great image. It's looking better on luminance mapping than it is with DaVinci mapping. But that means I've got to change it on a shot by shot. Actually, I don't know. Maybe that does look better. Let's take the saturation compression off and show you what's going on. Okay, actually it's handling it pretty well without, but that does normally help. You can see it on the scope here actually. It's definitely bringing it down into a more pleasing space there. All right, so that's the CST. Let's see what JP2499's doing. Let's drag and drop that on. And it's making a big change to the image. So this is without doing any grading. This is just straight with the defaults. Now what it is doing really well is handling these neons. Look at this trace here on the vectorscope. We've got no clipping going on. It's really nice, but it has skewed it around. Let's put the CST back on. Our reds were going up here. This is the natural color of the reds. Let's put the JP2499 on. And you see it all starts leaning over to one side. Actually, if you look at the blues here, this is slightly shifted. Let's put that CST back on again. You can see the natural color and the natural color of the red. So the natural colors are definitely changing. But I would say in a pleasing way, that looks fantastic. So we've got a little bit of a hue shift here and here. But that yellow looks really good. So for me, it feels like it's giving it a bit more density. It's a really pleasing look. So let's have a look at what's happening with mononodes. I'm just gonna reset it. So it's our Resolve CST that we used to. And let's apply mononodes. So we drag and drop that on. And this gives us a really good accurate. If you look at the scope, it's a really accurate representation of the true colors that are in the image. So if we look on here, our neons look really clean. We're getting really nice roll off in there. The toe mapping has been handled really well for me. And the blue is keeping its natural blue as well. Again, let's go back to the CST just to show you. So our reds are good. There's our reds and our blue here. Let's put the mononodes back on. And it's definitely giving us a much more pleasing image than that. This DRT is the one that I've been using on my last couple of broadcast jobs. And I just love how it's handling the neons. I love how it's handling interiors. I love how it's handling daylight. Let's have a look what's happening on the Open DRT. This one is the one that's new to me. As I said, check out Cullen's video on this. But I'm going to drag and drop that one on. Again, as I expected, we get this quite contrast. I don't think the neons have been handled that well in here, but I'm just going to take that down to base level. It might help quite a bit. There we go. So now we've got a much better looking image in there. Now for me, this is so important. These color scientists have spent months, if not years, making these DRTs absolutely incredible for us. The fact that Resolve allows third party developers to access the code is fantastic. You need DCTLs, which means you need the full version of Studio to do this. I apologize, my voice is a little bit rough in this. I did actually record this entire episode yesterday. I played it back. I wasn't happy with my delivery, but I was pretty exhausted after living it. This is quite a long one. So I have come back into Studio today. So think about subscribing. It's the hottest day of the year and it's gorgeous sunny day out in Brighton. And I'm here in the dark, re-recording this for you so I can give you the best I possibly can. I do appreciate it. I hope this has helped demystify what DRTs are. They've really changed my workflow. I'm using, I've used the JP2499 and I'm using the Mononodes Print One without the Kodak LUT on it. It is part of Look Lab Print. So you get lots more elements with it as well. Check it out, links in the description. Don't forget, I've got 10% discount code with Mononodes as well. Look after yourselves, enjoy your DRTs and I'll see you in the next episode.
