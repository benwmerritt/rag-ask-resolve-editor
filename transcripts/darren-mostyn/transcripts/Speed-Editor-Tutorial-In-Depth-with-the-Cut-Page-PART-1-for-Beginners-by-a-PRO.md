So, this is hopefully going to be the definitive guide to using the speed editor and the cut page. I'm going to show you how to get efficient with your editing, why the cut page is different to the edit page. I'm going to show you a couple of issues that I've had and how I get random and how I fix them and we're basically going to go through the whole thing and every single function on the speed editor. So, here it is. I'm going to show you all the buttons. I'm not just going to point to each button and tell you what it does. We're going to go through a proper exercise and show you how to use it properly but essentially this side here is your transport. So, this is how you navigate through your clips. This is where you choose between source and timeline and I'll explain to you the difference between that in the edit page and the cut page. This is our sort of multi-camera area where we choose different camera angles to work with. This is our trimming area and our main mark in and mark out. Up here you've got your different ways of bringing your clips down onto the timeline and over here we've got some extra features. So, let's take a look. So, oh by the way, to charge this up there's a USB socket on the back so you just plug it into USB. This works via USB connection to your PC or Mac and also works with Bluetooth so it can stay here and the battery is last for ages. And to check the battery level, if you go into the preferences up here and go to control panels you see there we've got our battery level currently set at 87%. So, we're in the cut page at the minute and what you see here is two timelines. These are permanently set on the interface. They're not customizable but what they are doing is the top timeline is showing you all my timeline. So, it's the entire program whether that be one minute or one hour, two clips or two thousand clips you always see the full view. So there is my full timeline. So, you can always get to the beginning really quickly, you can get to the end really quickly, you can navigate around your program really easily. The bottom timeline is a zoomed in version of the top one. So, if I go to this edit point here, this is a fixed playhead. So basically the timeline runs through that playhead. So, it's permanently fixed here and the timeline just runs through it. But this is a zoomed in. So, if I'm here you can see the edits just before the playhead here and you can see that here. There's the edit point and there's the playhead. So, it's a permanently fixed view. Now, if I go to the edit page you'll see that the timeline is exactly the same. So there's our playhead, there's our cut point just before it and there's our same number of edits. So, anything I do in here if I just adjust this a little bit that has followed into the cut page and done exactly the same thing. So, there's that edit point there. If I just trim it back again and let's go to our edit page and it's supplied the same trim in the edit page. So, the two pages talk to each other. So, you can work in the edit page and the cut page at any time you like. The two are talking to each other. The difference between the two, the main difference and this is where people get a little bit confused. So, unless you come from Final Cut Pro you might not find this obvious to start with. If I'm on my edit page and I take a shot here, okay, what I can do is trim, sorry, if I can trim this side here and when I trim that it's basically in a freestyle mode, okay, because we're in this arrow here. So, I'm not rippling my timeline. So, let me just undo that. If I go into this mode, if I do the same thing, it now ripple trims my edit. So, it always keeps the gap closed. If I shorten the edit point here, the rest of the timeline is going to come up to fill the gap. So, in the cut page this behavior is different. V1, Video Track 1 is always in ripple mode, okay. So, if I trim the front of this clip here, actually let's do this with the speed editor. So, if I just jog through a little bit, if I go to here. If I just trim in, it takes the incoming point here and allows me to trim and you see that that ripples my timeline. Everything else is moving up with it. Now, I can't change that mode. I can't do it like I did in the edit page where you can trim and leave a gap. It doesn't work like that. The video layer 1 in the cut page is always ripple delete. So, it's ripple timeline, sorry. V2, however, I can run independent. So, I can just run it freestyle and it doesn't ripple up the timeline. It's just regular trim. So, if I get my trim in on here, I can trim away and that doesn't affect my timeline. So, all the timelines apart from V1 are non-ripple, okay. And that's where people get confused in the cut page. I have done an episode on the cut page so you can have a look at that. So, essentially, V1 is a magnetic timeline. So, one thing you need to look at for getting quick and efficient editing with the speed editor is you have to embrace the cut page. There are several features in here that are designed to work specifically with the speed editor to get you editing quickly. And I know I get a lot of comments from people saying they wish that all this functionality works in the edit page, but it doesn't work in the edit page because the edit page has different functionality. So, for example, the edit page doesn't have source tape. So, if I press source here, it takes me into a source tape mode, which I'm going to explain shortly. If I go to the edit page and press source, it just highlights my source viewer. So, it's a completely different functionality that you don't have source tape in the edit page. That's the main reason why. So, really just embrace the cut page and do your main body of editing and then go over to the edit page and finesse it all in there. That's what I did. So, in the cut page, there's three main areas that are going to get you editing quick. There's the source tape, which allows us to look at all our B-roll in one hit, which I'm going to show you shortly. There is, I think, a smart insert. So, when I'm insert editing into the timeline, I don't have to be absolutely accurately on the edit point. So, smart insert is this button here. And what it does, if I just take a shot here, so let's go to our B-roll and let's have a look at our arrivals and we could take a shot like this. And I'm going to use the speed editor now. So, let's go to our jog first. So, jog allows me to just move through nice and accurately through the shot. Scroll goes a little bit quicker through the shot and shuttle allows me to just leave the jog wheel in a certain position and it will just move in that speed. So, depending how far I turn that depends how fast it goes. I don't tend to use shuttle as much as jog and scroll. Okay, so we've got a shot here. Let's just go to the front of our timeline. Okay, so I need a different shot than that. Here we go. So, we're going to go in and I'm just going to mark an in point there, mark in, press play. You've got nice big mark in and out buttons out there. And to insert that into my timeline, if I press timeline now, okay, I don't have to be exactly on the edit point. Okay, so what I can do, as long as I'm near an edit point, you get this indicator here. This is a smart indicator and it's telling me which side of the clip it will insert the clip to. I don't have to be exactly on that edit point. So, I'm just going to do smart insert and it's going to drop it exactly where that indicator was. So, it's put it right here. Let's play that back. Okay, so we've got our edit point. So, let's just see if that works. I think we need to just trim a little bit off the front of that. So, I'm going to go to trim in on this side of the clip. Then we go trim in and we're just going to take him just when he comes past that window and that's done. That's our edit done. So, if I press smart insert on the edit page, it literally inserts where my playhead is. So, if I press play, so in the cut page, it edits to the nearest edit point. Whereas in the edit page, if I press smart insert, it literally inserts at the point where the playhead was. So, I'm going to undo that. To undo, if you press this button here twice, it undoes. So, you've got escape and undo here. So, each of these buttons has a, or not all of them, but a lot of them have another line of text. So, it has a double functionality. Some of these buttons have a double click. Some of them have a triple click. Some of them have a click and hold function and I'm going to show you what all of them do. So, let's go back to the cut page. What I want to do now is edit another bit of this interview. So, at the moment, we've got, we've got three or four clips at the front, just a little bit of B-roll stuff and then we've got this interview here. I'm going to edit that up anyway. I'm going to be in the shop by certain course of events. So, don't forget, if you want to zoom in and out on the cut page, you don't do that. You basically would grab the top timeline here to go near the end or the beginning and let the bottom timeline just work in itself. So, I'm going to go to the end of this interview. The bicycle. A certain course of events. We found out that Rosebud was really a bicycle. Right. So, after that, let's go back to the interview. Now, if I click on here, we've got interviews bin here and this interview is a two-camera shoot, but we're just focusing on the first camera. Now, normally, traditionally, you would line these two cameras up to start with before you do any editing, but I'm going to show you a really cool function here that allows us to not have to worry about that. So we're in our interview. There's some markings and outs on there already. To clear those, if you just press in and out together, that clears them. If you want to just clear an in, double click and double click an out to clear an out point. Okay, let's play that through. So I'm just using, I'm in Jog mode at the minute. So let's go through scroll mode. If you look at the audio waveforms on here, okay, when I'm in scroll mode or shuttle mode, you see the entire clips audio. And when I go to Jog mode, it automatically zooms in. So you can really get precise on your endpoints. It's really good. So let's play that through. I want to edit this bit of interviewing here. Well, here at Citizen Chain, we'd like to try to fix challenging bikes. We'll fix older bikes that other bike shops have refused to fix. Either they don't have the knowledge or they don't have the tooling. Okay, so let's take that there. So I want to drop that down to my timeline. I can just press append and that will put it onto the end of my timeline. There we go. If you want just video or just audio, you press these two buttons here, one of those two buttons. Okay, and if they're off, obviously it brings down the video and the audio. Now that just comes down onto one track down here. So let's have a listen to the interview now. We've got our first bit of interview here. Let's play that through and let's just tidy it up a little bit. So that is the brainchild of my partner. He named the shop. I was a big... Okay, so let's get rid of that beginning bit. I don't really need that. So let's jog through. Yeah. I'm going to do an out point there. I'm going to go back to the beginning of that shop. Now if I put snap on, so it was already on, the snap function here will snap to an edit point. You just get a little bit of a breeze on the jog. So I can move the jog, but it doesn't actually move the timeline. So you get a little bit of a moment. So I'm going to mark in there and what I'm going to do is press ripple delete and that is going to delete the mark in an out point and ripple everything up in the timeline. So there we go. So that's our first edit done. Let's play that back. I was a big fan of Orson Welles. I had done several projects on him going through school and stuff like that. So I appreciated the pun and the play on the word of citizen Keynes, citizen Shane. And then only after we named the shop by certain course of events. Right. So let's get rid of by certain course of events. I'm just going to back that up. And then only after we named the shop. So I can do that in several ways. What I'm going to do is split the clip at that point. So I press split. Now if I trim in by certain course of events and I can actually hear what's going on. Now the nice thing is I've got this really nice enlarged waveform going on here. You don't see that unless you're in trim mode. But that's because this icon here is on. Okay. So if I take that off, let me just show you. If I go to trim in, you see then all you see is a very small waveform here. But if I put that back on and you enter trim mode, you get an enlarged waveform. So it's a really nice tool. So there's our enlarged waveform. Okay. Let's play that back. The play on the word of citizen Keynes, citizen Shane. And then only after we named the shop, we found out that Rosebud was really a bicycle. Well here it's citizen. Okay. Let's take off that. So again, I'm just going to literally go into trim mode. And that's done. So you can see how quick, flexible and easy that is. And it's really nice control using the speed editor. You get really, it's really tactile. You get a really nice feel for the edit points. Now I also want to adjust his audio level a little bit. So what I can do, so I'm just going to grab these three shots. And if I press here, my audio level button and keep it pressed, as I move my jog, can you see the audio levels adjusting there? So you can actually lift or lower the audio level. Now I'm not trying to do precise audio mixing here by any stretch of the imagination. I just want to get a base audio level. So I'm sort of roughly balanced. But I'm going to do fine tuning of that in the edit page or the fairlight page. So if I get to the edit page, just to show you, there's the edits that we've just done. There's our raised timeline level. And that audio feature works in here as well. Now you can see I can adjust the audio in the edit page as well. And back to the cut page. And we're done. So that's our interview starting to come together. What I want to do now is focus on the front and get a bit more B-roll down. And to do that, I'm going to use what's called source tape. Let me go to the master here. I've got several bins here at the top. And one of them says B-roll. And if I go into that one, I've got three subfolders in here. I've got clips of him arriving, clips of him riding, and clips of him working. I want to have a look at all that footage to make a little montage at the beginning. Traditionally, what I'd have to do is go into the bin. Let's have a look. And then double click each of these shots and have a mess around in here and see which shot I like. So you're sort of doing this sort of thing. But that is quite time consuming. So what I'm going to do is go back one level. So I'm in my B-roll. And if I press this function here called source, which is actually going to activate the source tape. So in the cut page, it activates the source tape. So I'm going to press source. So what it does is allow me to view those three bins at once. And that's represented by one clip, one sort of virtual clip in my source viewer. So what I can do now is use my scroll to navigate through. And you see at the top here, as I move through these clips, the shot is updating in my media pool. OK, so that is all those shots there. Now, as I get to the end and move on to the next shot, there you see now we're in the next bin and that is still on the same clip. So it's really cool. Source tape is just like one great big virtual clip. Now, what you can also do to navigate to it quickly, you can either use the jog shuttle or you can use your up, down, left, right arrow keys on your keyboard. So you see that I'm going up and down between each of the bins. Now, these bins, the order that they appear on here in the source tape is determined up here on this list. So at the minute I'm sorting by bin, you can sort by time code, camera. You could assign a color to each clip and it would be organized by clip color in this instance. So I've got mine set to bin and we're basically just looking at the bins in order. So it's alphabetical order arriving, writing, working. OK, so let's have a look and find some shots to get the beginning. I'm just going to move my time and play head roughly to the beginning. So we've got a shot going down the hill. Then he's arriving to the shop. It comes into the shop and locks his bike. OK, so let's get one more shot of him actually riding in general. So I'm going to go to my source tape. The temptation is to just double click a bin, but I'm not going to do that. I'm going to go straight to my source tape. So if I want to focus just on what's happening in the arriving section, if I press source tape again, it takes me just into that section. So I've now got a more refined view that I'm looking at. So I can go and choose another shot. Let's get that shot of him coming down there with the dog. Mark in. Something like that. And my smart indicator here is showing me which side the edits going to go into. Just press smart insert and that's the edit done. I don't have to be accurate. I didn't have to get to the edit point. Smart insert will go to the nearest edit. So that is four shots on our front now. So we've got this shot. We've got this shot. OK, so this needs trimming up a bit. It's all a little bit loose at the minute. So I'm going to trim out this time. So I'm going to trim the end of this shot up. Grab my scroll, grab my jog wheel, just trim that back a little bit. This shot here is quite long as well. What I want to do is slip it. I want to make sure that we haven't got excess on the end when he comes off the frame. So if I press slip source, that will slip this side. Slip destination slips the second shot. OK, so let's go to slip source. And what I want to do is just make sure that I just get the point where he leaves frame. So I'm looking at this side here. And all it's doing is slipping the clip. So I'm not changing the duration. I'm not changing the edit points. I'm just slipping the shot inside that framework. And let's trim a little bit off the front because it's a little bit long. OK, let's play that through. So he goes off, leaves frame still a little bit long on there. So let's just trim the out point. There we go. That's the exact point he leaves frame and we're getting there. Oh, another thing in the source tape. Let me just show you this is if you have we've got three bins open at the minute. If I get a source, that's going to show us our three bins. What you can actually do is mark an in and an out range. Let's just scroll that right down. And if I press source now, it will do the in out range so you can span multiple bins in. So that's another really cool feature. Let's just escape that. I don't need to do that. I'm going to clear the ends and out double press. OK, so what I want to do now is put a little bit of music down on that. So we've actually got an idea of how long this little sequence needs to be to come out of source tape. By the way, just press time. Then go to my audio. Just here. And I'm literally going to throw that underneath now to put that into the time and I can just drag and drop it. And throw it on like that. Or if I undo what I could do is load my source viewer and literally press place on top. So obviously in video that would put a video layer on top of the next video layer. But in audio, obviously it's coming underneath. That throws that down underneath my audio layer. So again, I'm using my top timeline to navigate. Don't navigate using your bottom time line because you'll be pulling and pulling and pulling for ages. What you need to do is just grab the tape right here, straight to the front and you're good to go. Right, so what I want to happen is I want the interview to start on that drumbeat. So what I've got to do is shorten all these edits so that when the drums start, we literally hear the first part of our interview there. So we need to lose a bit of this dog shot. That's trim in. And what I want to do so that it doesn't ripple and damage our audio edit, I'm going to lock the audio track. Right, let's have a look at the next shot. We can tighten a bit of the back of that up. And this shot needs to tighten up a little bit as well. And the next shot. How far are we off the drums? There's the drumbeat. So we just need to shave a little bit more off. What you can do off this shot here. And there we go. We've got the interview now starting. If you look here, you can see by the waveforms that the interview is going to start just on the drums. I, was the fact that you can put a little bit back on this shot. Let's trim it the other way so it lines up perfectly. Now what I'm going to do, obviously this is going to be really loud against the interview. I, was the interview. So what we can do is go back and say yeah. I'm going to say split. I'm going to unlock my audio track. I'm going to split that. And then I'm going to go to this side. And I'm going to drop that audio level down using the audio tool. Remember just press and hold and drop that right down. I was a big. So obviously we need to put an audio mix in there. So I'm going to go to my transitions. I need to audio and I'm going to add a crossfade. Now let's play the crossfade. I was a big fan of horse. Okay, so if you want to adjust that, what we can do is go here. We can go to transition duration, which is this button here. So you see we're slowly getting through all these buttons. So there I can change the duration. And if I double press that, that sets that to be the default duration. Okay, so that's a really quick way of making a default duration. And what else I want to do is just roll it back a little bit. So if I go into roll mode, I need to just click on here to make that happen. Press roll. And what I'm actually doing now is just rolling the edit point. So we're not trimming it. We're just rolling the edit point off. So you see how accurate I'm getting this. I was a big fan of horse and wells. Okay, it's not perfect, but it's a lot better than it was. And like I said, you would go into the edit page. Let's just show you what's going on there. There's our clip. There's the transition that we've just done. And we can just keep tweaking that. So let's have a listen to the interview and get this a little bit tighter. He's a big fan of horse and wells. I had done several projects on him going through school and stuff like that. So I appreciated the pun. So let's get rid of the going through school. I've done several projects. I've done several projects on him going through school and stuff like that. So. Okay, so I've done a mark in and a mark out on a little section I want to remove. Ripple, delete. Make sure our audio soundtrack is locked. And let's just have a listen to that. I was a big fan of horse and wells. I appreciated. I just need to trim off that little bit we've got left. Horse and wells. I'll put it back. So I'm going to go to trim out here. And I'm going to trim the in just to get rid of that bit as well. It is a big fan of horse and well. I appreciate it. I've just missed off the wells. So I'm just going to go and trim that out. You see how really quick I can do this. You can get this magnification of the audio is fantastic. I appreciate it. The pond. Great. So we've now got an edit, but we've now got the jump cut. And of horse and wells. I could do is use this function here, smooth cuts, and that will do a sort of morph on it. Let me just adjust the duration of that because that's definitely going to be too long. So just go transition duration with the smooth cut. You want it to be nice and short. So that is currently that's 10 frames. So I've been looking at it. Big fan of horse and wells. I appreciate that actually works really well. But it doesn't always. So what would we do if that didn't work so well to change that from being a smooth cut? You just press cut. You don't have to be exactly on it. If you just press cut, it will change the nearest transition to be a cut again. So how can we get round this jump cut? So what we can do is go to our second camera. So let's have a look at the second camera, which is in interviews. So we've got a camera one and a camera two. So how do we get those synced together? Normally you would do that at the beginning of the edit. You wouldn't do it when you're halfway through cutting interviews. But there's a really cool feature in here called sync bin. So what I'm going to do is take the two shots here. They're in their own bin. So I don't have to highlight them. I'm going to press this icon here. Okay. And that brings up this sync view. So what we do now is determine how do we want DaVinci Resolve to sync these two clips together? I can sync by timecode. So if they've got timecode, in fact, if they've got timecode matching, you don't even have to do this process. These clips don't have matching timecode, but they do have both have audio. So I can sync by audio waveform. If you haven't got audio waveform or timecode, you can sync by a mark-in. So you just literally put your own mark on there and it will sync by the markers. All you've got to do then is press sync. Let's get it analyzed the two clips. Oh, sorry. I need to be in audio mode. Press sync. Okay. And there's two camera angles and now sunk together. So I'm going to press save sync. So what we can do now is switch automatically to the other camera angle. So let's play that through. I appreciated the pun and the play on the word. Okay. So all I've got to do is go into this mode here, which is sync bin. Now I choose which camera I want to be. So I want camera two at this point. So I'm going to press camera two. And all I've got to do now is press one of these buttons here. So I'm going to press source overwrite. And what that will do is match the source. It's going to put a five second clip down for me. It's defaults to five seconds. And that will be perfectly in sync with my into. So let's have a look in wells. I'm going to go to timeline so you can see full screen wells. I appreciated the pun and the play on the word of citizen canes, citizen change. So there we go. We're perfectly in sync with the other camera angle. All I've got to do now is trim that back so we can go to trim here. It's got trim in. Trim that back to any point. It was a big fan of Orson wells. I appreciated the pun and the play on the word. So what I need to do is just be a little bit nearer the trim out point. I'm going to press camera three, which is going to select track three. Trim out. I'm going to pull that back to somewhere around about here. I appreciated the pun and the play on the word of citizen canes, citizen change. So let's just do it exactly where it says citizen cane. And we did the pun and the play on the word of citizen canes, citizen change. That's great. Okay, we can even take out that if we want to. What else I can do is use another feature. There's a feature here called close up. And what I'm going to do is at this point here, I'm going to press close up. What it will do is automatically it's going to put the same shot on top of itself, but it's going to close up on it. I'm just going to trim that back a little bit. I appreciated the pun. But you can see what it's done is it's not quite aligned. So to realign that, if I just press and hold this, I can now adjust the Y position. It was a big fan of Orson Welles. I appreciated the pun and the play on the word of citizen canes, citizen change. Great. So we're really quickly and easily showing you what all these buttons do now and getting our interview looking good. And I think just to finish this panel off, this one here is dissolved and that's pretty much all that then covered. So just to show you what's going on here, if I move over to the edit page, you can see we've got exactly the same thing happening. So the two are talking to each other and I can adjust this at any point. So if I want to get rid of that, if I just highlight it, delete it, go back to my cut page, it's gone. So let me just quickly show you some of the other little features that are in here. If I go to the top of the timeline, let's bring in, let's put a title in here. So I'm going to go to my titles, I'm going to grab a text here, just drop it on top, let's just trim it back. And let's go to our inspector. Okay, now if you want to choose a different font, what you can do is go to here and press and hold. The first one does your transitions, okay? If you double click and hold, it does your fonts. You can go through all your different fonts that you've got on your system. So it's a really nice quick way of having a review of what font you want it to be. So one click changes the transition. So let's change that back. I don't really want that to be that. Let's make it a clock-wide, why not? Okay, let's change the duration again. Bring that right down. There we go. The other thing we've got on here is the ability to put markers on there. So if I go to here and double press the audio level button, it adds a marker. And if I carry on, let's say you want to add another one, if I double click and hold, you can then choose a different marker color. And then the next time I press marker, it will stay that color. Now if I triple click, you get the colored marker and you get the dialogue box here, ready to just type in whatever notes you want for the marker. And then to get rid of that box, just press escape. And if you want to do place on top, let's just go back here. What else we can do is go to our source, go to our logo here. And if I press press place on top, that just throws it on top of the whole thing. So I'm going to switch into the color page and just show you what works on the speed editor in the color page. So in here, we've got the things that main things that work is obviously your jog and scroll and shuttle. That all works really nicely. And if I do a mark in and a mark out and have my loop play on, this becomes my loop. So you can define an area so that could span multiple shots. Let's take that out off. A big fan of Orson Welles, I appreciated the pun. So maybe I want my loop play to be both of those things. I was a big fan of Orson Welles, I appreciated the pun. So that works. You can clear those with a double click. Markers work. You can't do the colored biomarker, but the marker will do work. So you can add a mark here like that. The split works. So what's nice with the split is if you're doing a conform and often if you work with a flattened file and you use an EDL to do the pre-conform, what can happen sometimes is it misses a shot. So in the color page, you need to split that clip. Otherwise you're grading two different shots with the same color grade. So in order to split the shot, what you do is you come in. So let's imagine this is two shots, but it's represented as one icon. If I just press split, it splits it into two. Normally you would have to go into the edit page and cut that in the edit page, but you can just do it straight here with the split button. So that's really useful for conforming. Anything you do, you can undo in here. And the other thing that works that's really nice, if I just grab this still, is the jog shuttle acts as a wipe. So when you're comparing stills, or when you're comparing a still to your live footage, the jog shuttle works as a wipe. So that's really cool. In the edit page, you've got pretty good functionality. The cameras don't work on multi-cam. Okay, so the cameras are working in something different, which I'm going to show you shortly. But the roll, ripple, all that sort of stuff works. All the trimming features work. The source button will just highlight your source viewer. It doesn't work as a source tape. Timeline is obviously going to highlight your timeline. A full view works. This red button here will take us into full view. That works in the color page, the cut page, and the edit page. So you get a really nice full view there. And things like the dissolves and cuts work as well. So after editing all this together, I realized I actually missed off a few buttons off the speed editor. So let me show you what they are now. First one is an important one. It's ripple overrides. And this allows me to very easily change a shot on my timeline. So let's say for example, I want to get rid of this shot here. I'm going to go to my source tape. I'm going to find a new shot. So there we go. Let's just mark in there and mark out there. The new duration, this in-out point that we've just done here, will replace this clip's duration. So I'm just going to press ripple over, right? And you see that it's inserted the new clip in and adjusted the duration. So it's rippled our timeline up. So it'll either extend or shorten your timeline to accommodate the new clip going in. So it's a really quick and easy way of just replacing shots without having to worry about the duration. Okay, the other thing we've got on here is the ability to zoom the timeline. So if I just press this button here, you'll see that I can adjust my interface really easily. We have a full view button. So it's nice and good. That works in the color page and the edit page. And down here we've got slides. So underneath the roll, we've got slides. So if I double click and hold, you'll see now that I'm sliding my clip along my timeline. So I'm not changing the in and out points. I'm literally changing its position in the edit. So that's slide. And the other one is move. So underneath split, we've got move. So if I press it once and hold, I can now move the clip along my timeline. And the other one up here is underneath smart insert and append. You've got clip. And what that does is it will bring in the entire clip. It doesn't matter about the in and out points. So again, if I go back to my source and let's choose a new clip. So we want this clip here. If I press the append button twice, it will bring the entire clip down to my timeline. You can see that's brought that down there. Now if I undo that, you can also append to a different track. So if I press camera 2 here, you'll see that video track 2 is now highlighted. And if I append again now, that's my source viewer, and double click, that now appends it to track 2. So the camera angles also double up as being a track selector. So camera 1 and then camera 2. So that's another really useful function. So in part 2, we're going to look at the sync bin in far more detail. And I'm going to show you some sync issues that I've had and how to fix that. So if you've enjoyed this episode, think about subscribing, look after yourselves, and I'll see you in part 2.
