Right, so I've recently discovered a little hidden gem in DaVinci Resolve. So I'm going to show you what it is. I'm creating a brand new project and as usual, as I've had to do for many, many years, when I create a new project, I have to go in and change a few of the parameters. Now the main reason for this is in my project settings. First thing, it's set to 24 frames per second by default. I work in 25, 99% of the time. And my playback frame rate, I want to be 25. My video format, I want to be 1080, 25p if I'm working in HD. Obviously that'd be Ultra HD if I'm working in 4K. And the other thing I have to change is my color management settings because they default to Rec 709 scene. Now I'm going to bring that down to be Rec 709 Gamma 2.4. And my timeline color space, I often work in DaVinci Wide Gamma Intermediate. So what's the big deal? Well, what I have to do is make all those changes each and every time. Now I have created a preset. So if I go to my presets here, I've got one called Darren 25p Rec 709. If you want to create your own preset, just set all the parameters that you want in the settings and the color management and any of these other options. And you simply then say save as and you can create your own presets. So all I've got to do really is double click this one preset here and say apply. And then all those settings are done each time. But I've just discovered this and this is courtesy of my very good friend Chris Roberts. So I'll give you the acknowledgement there, Chris. And basically set all your settings how you want them. Let me just check my color management is correct. And I'm going to click on these three dots up here. Just check my 25 frames per second. Yep. These three dots here reveal this menu set current settings as default preset. That means I never have to do this ever again. So I'm just going to press that, say update. And that setting is applied by default. So I never have to even change the preset. So this is fantastic. So thank you very much for that one, Chris. If you want to know why I've set these settings as they are, check out this video here and that will go into some detail about why I work like that. And look after yourselves and hit the subscription, hit the notification and I'll see you in the next episode. Hi, Lulu. Yeah, I can't give you a lift. Can I? I've got broken ribs. Yeah, they do still hurt. Yeah. Yeah. Ask mum.
