Okay, so if you're wondering whether the investment in the new Mac Pro 2019 is really worth it, you're in the right place. I'm going to do a comparison between the Mac Pro 2013 machine and the new Mac Pro 2019. So I'm Darren Mostyn, I'm a colorist and what I've done is create a project in DaVinci Resolve. I'm going to run the same project on a 2013 machine and then on a 2019 machine and compare the actual results. I've had a real true comparison of the playback speeds and render speeds. So before we start, let's just have a look at the specs. The Mac Pro 2013 machine is an 8-core 3 GHz machine, 32 GHz RAM and the graphics card in there is the Dual AMD D700. So that's 6 GB of VRAM on each channel. The Mac Pro 2019 is a 16-core 3.2 GHz machine with 96 GB of RAM and one of the Dual Vega 2 graphics cards, that's 32 GB on each channel there. Also has the Apple Afterburner card installed. To keep the comparison true, we're going to connect both machines to the same RAID. So we're running off of Pegasus 2 R6 RAID, it's a Thunderbolt 2, so generally about 700 megabits a second and both machines will be running on Resolve 16.2.2. Okay, so let's have a look at the project we're going to use on both machines. We've got a series of clips here. Our master timeline is set to Ultra HD resolution. So we're going to render out at Ultra HD. The first few clips on the timeline, this is a one minute timeline by the way, it's exactly one minute long. The first few clips are taken from a TV commercial we graded. This is 4K Canon RAW footage and regular kind of grade going on here. So we've got about 19 layers going on on that one, similar on this one. Bit of keying, bit of tracking, that sort of stuff. Here we've got a HD shot. This is 1920 by 1080 ProRes 422HQ shot. And what I've done is I've made a duplicate of the shot, 16 layers and I've done an individual grade on each layer. So it's a really easy way to just test how it performs with multiple layers. I've then grouped these together and added one more effect on top just to give it a little bit of stress. The next three shots are from a corporate shoot that we worked on. This again is C200 4K. Regular kind of grade going on here. So we've got a bit of keying, we've got some effects going on. There's a colour space transform here as you can see. The next shot is a GoPro so that's quite a good little test as well. And in here what I did is I've taken the grade and I've actually added some stuff in fusion just to really push the processing power. So we've got a soft glow going on, a colour correction, there's a title coming in with a bit of defocus on it and that should really push the system to the max. And the final clip on here is a B-Raw. It's a Blackmagic 4.6K film clip in RAW. And again we've got about eight or nine layers going on there, a little bit of keying and window stuff. Let's see what sort of frame playback we get. So on the first clips this is the 4K Canon stuff, 4K RAW. We're getting nearly 25 frames per second. There's quite a lot going on on this first shot, there's a lot of keying going on and tracking. Let's see if it gets... Yes, we're getting up to nearly 25 frames per second then. So it's an almost real time playback but not quite. Okay, so let's move on to our 16 layers of HD ProRes 4 to 2 HQ and see what playback we get there. So I'm pressing play and we're getting nowhere near real time. So about 5.5 frames per second. We've been down to three there. So it's coming up a little bit. So between five and nine frames per second playback there. So not amazing but that is 16 layers of video layers and also has a OFX on there. It's the Vignette OFX I put on as a group. It's the C200 4K. We've got a colour space transform, we've got an OFX going on there, we've got film grain in here. So we're getting...that's what's really killing this one, here's the film grain. So we're down to eight frames per second here. Let's see what happens when it moves to the H264 GoPro clip. That's a 2K GoPro coming up. So yep, so we're easily getting 25 frames per second there, no problem. And then we're into the last clip which is...sorry, the second to last clip which is again from the Canon C200. A bit of colour grading going on but it's also got these fusion effects. So we're getting 13 frames per second, 15 frames per second, it's not too bad at all actually. And finally our B-Raw clip and straight away 25 frames per second, no problem there with what we've got there, 8, 9, 10 layers going on. That is a good example of showing us what sort of playback speeds we can get with that. But let's go and render this out. First thing I'm going to do is delete the render cache just to check that there's nothing pre-rendered in there. So that's done, I'm going to go to the delivery page and we're just going to render this one minute sequence out, various formats and resolutions and we're going to render it out as a ProRes Quad 4 Ultra HD file. So this is the Mac Pro 2013 in UHD. Add to the render queue and let's do it. So for the render speeds of the 4K Canon Raw we're getting nearly real time playback there, that's pretty good, there's quite a lot going on in that one. Ok so we're coming up to our 16 layers of HD, let's have a look at what that does. Again we're really slow here so we're down to 3 or 4 frames per second processing. Then on to our C200 4K footage, remember this has got film grain on it so that's why we're looking at about 7 frames per second on this shot. So I can hear the fans kicking in on the Mac Pro 2013 now. There's the GoPro clip, now we're into the Fusion clip so we're down to again to now to 4 frames per second, 4.5 frames per second. The last Blackmagic clip is running at just about real time. So there's the job done, that's completed in 2 minutes 56 seconds, so it's a 1 minute clip rendered in 2 minutes 56 seconds. So one last test, I'd like to now render it out in HD resolution and just see what sort of render speeds we get. So I'm going to go to my timeline settings, switch that to 1920 by 1080 HD, add to the render queue and let's see how quick that goes. This should be much faster than the 4K. Yeah so we're getting faster than real time now. And that has completed a HD clip ProRes Quad 4 in 1 minute 5 seconds so let's take a look at what the 2019 Mac Pro does. So here we are on the 2019 Mac Pro, we've got the same project loaded just to make sure I'm going to go to the cache and delete all the cache to make sure that nothing is pre-rendered. So that's deleted. And the other thing I want to do is just check that we're on our metal settings. So if we go to preferences up here, system memory and just check the graphics card so we've got the Radeon Pro Vega 2 Duo, it's set to metal and the second channel is also set to metal. This is going to give us the optimum performance. So let's check the playback speeds first. Let's go to our first shot. This was the 4K Canon RAW regular sort of TV commercial setup so we've got about 15, 20 odd nodes going on here and this is all playing back at 25 frames per second. Absolutely no problems at all as I'd expect. Let's have a look here at the, this was the 16 channels of ProRes 42 HQ each one with a different grade on it and again, it's taken it's time but yeah 25 frames per second so we're getting full frame playback there. This is the C200 4K RAW with some OFX on it and a bit of grain. Again 25 frames per second no problem. This is the GoPro stuff, again 25 no problem at all. This is the Fusion stuff so let's see how this does. 25 frames per second, 25, 25 all the way, look at that, 25 frames per second all the way. This is with Fusion added effects as well. And this is the B RAW Blackmagic 4.6K film and again 25 frames per second all the way. So very happy with that, everything's playing back at full speed. So let's take a look at the render speeds. So over to the delivery page and we're set to Ultra HD which is great and we'll call this Ultra HD Mac 2019. I'm doing ProRes Quad 4 again exactly the same as we did before and I'm going to add that to the render queue and let's see how quick it renders this. So remember before we were at about 2 minutes 56 for this sequence, definitely rendering faster than real time. The 16 layers is rendering just under real time, 17 frames a second, all faster than real time. 58, 59 frames per second then. This is the Fusion stuff and finally our B RAW is going at 70 odd frames per second then. So that rendered out in 40 seconds. So on the 2013 machine that rendered in 2 minutes 56 on the 2019 machine that is a staggering 40 seconds. That really is a huge speed difference. Let's try it in HD. So just go to my settings here. HD, save, let's do the same thing. So on the 2013 machine this rendered in 1 minute 5. Okay off we go. So we're getting frame counts of 87 then, 47 frames per second. Let's see what it does on the 16 layers. 16 layers is going at 50 frames per second, 100 frames per second. The Fusion stuff is going at 45 frames per second then. It's just slowed down a little bit at the end and the B RAW is going at 88 seconds. That has rendered in 25 seconds compared to 1 minute 5. So that's more than twice as fast. That's incredible. So I hope you found that useful. Let me know what you think in the comments below. It would be good to hear from you and let me know if you have any specific tests that you want me to do. I will try my best to accommodate that. Hit subscribe. This is a new channel. I'm trying to build it up so that I can give you lots of tips and tricks for DaVinci Resolve. I have a Facebook page which you can check out which is Killer Tips DaVinci Resolve, full of little useful tips for Resolve users. Thanks for watching. I'm Darren Mustyn. Take care of yourselves and I'll see you on the next video.
