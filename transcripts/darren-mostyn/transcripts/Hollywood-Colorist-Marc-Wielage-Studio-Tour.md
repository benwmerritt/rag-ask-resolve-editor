5 o'clock in the morning, very peaceful, bright and on my way to the airport. So I'm here at the airport, I had to get here stupid early because my Covid test wouldn't upload properly on the website yesterday, that was the most stressful day I've had for a long time. So I've come here hoping to get a nice massage in the lounge but they don't do massages now because of Covid and instead they do helisop bikes, which is hardly the same thing, going to get some champagne instead. Cheers. So I found a little roof garden at Heathrow Airport, I wouldn't say it's exactly peaceful but it's the sunny shiny, it's actually really nice. There you go, that plane is absolutely kick-off now. This is great. Right sir, have a good flight. So I just boarded in the flight, about 12 hours to go. Hello, my name is Amanda, I'm the flight attendant and I'm a jet on today's flight. I only got one beer and my flight doesn't work and my seat is broken, so I'm going to go a bit of a shame because I want to watch the magic design live stream. Finally at the hotel room. Day one Los Angeles, let's go. Good flight bro. Now we're just driving in the front side of the road because in only about a week right, we'll go on the right. You guys don't know how to fucking drive, you're still on the left. What the hell is that? It's the front way. So coming through I just had a beautiful lunch with Walter and he's a busy man so I'm going to leave in the middle of the night. We're going to go back. So I'm back in Hollywood, I'm at the original Technicolor building and I'm meeting Mark Village for lunch. Right, off for lunch with Mark Village, we are going to encounters on Fairfax which is a very exciting venue. I should be more excited about this portion that's about to hit us. So right behind me you should just be able to see Quentin Tarantino's cinema so they show everything on film only in their Strictly film. Sometimes I get a little weary of people who are obsessed with analog and film looks and so on but I have to admire Quentin Tarantino because he has such an almost religious devotion to preserving film and keeping the tradition of showing film prints and theaters going as he has over here at the Beverly Cinema. So Mark, we've met before, I just wanted to move studios. Yes, we are in a new room, we're in about a 400 square foot color room. Yeah, it definitely seems bigger than your class room. It is, my business partner, another color, Henry Santos, he and I were determined to have the exact same color experience in our private office that we did for many years at Technicolor Hollywood. So we have the full advanced panels, we have the two display Resolve setup, we have a dedicated display just for scopes and a 31 inch color monitor which is technically approaching Dolby Vision levels. Okay, what's your I-O box for that one? We are using the Blackmagic 4K, is it an Ultra? It's an Extreme? One you were 3. Two you were 13. We have two of them, we have one that's an Extreme and one that's a regular 4K. And one of them is used for actual monitoring and the other one is just used for scopes. So this little monitor is pretty cute, you've seen my scope setup this a lot before. This is a widescreen, I'm not sure if it's a Samsung or an LG model, we've replaced it a couple of times because they tend to burn out. But I like the idea of seeing all the scopes and a widescreen display and to me it's better to separate the scopes out from Resolve so it's that little bit less of a strain on the overall system. All the scopes are being handled in another box. So what sort of stuff do you work on? We do a variety of stuff, the majority of what I do here is restoring old movies and when I say old movies, it's movies from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s for home video streaming and archival purposes. We also do the occasional commercial, some specials, we do shorts, we did a dozen sketch comedy pieces for Wycombe CBS just a couple of months ago so I think those are out now, little five, six minute sketches. So the answer is we sort of do a little bit of everything. Yeah, like maybe we all have to. I mean we have a very simple business policy, we don't turn down work. So everyone knows you, obviously in the Resolve forums, you're very, well, probably the most helpful person I know on those forums. I think you and Jim Robertson did that a lot of time and I know a lot of people are very appreciative of that especially with the Mac experience you've got in Resolve. So you clearly resolve addicts with us. Yeah, I would say that's true and part of what I'm bringing is the experience I had, I've been a colorist for more than 40 years in Hollywood and managed to survive and one thing I loved in the 80s and 90s and early 2000s was the camaraderie we had where I would work for a company that had, I don't know, 10, 12, 15, 16 colorists in one building and in general, we all got along together. We were all part of the same family, we looked out for each other. So if one person found out a cool new feature in DaVinci, they would run down the hall to the other guys and go, hey, look at what I just discovered, DaVinci will do this if you hit this button. And we would go, wow, I've got to try that on my phone. It was the forum before forums. Yeah, so basically the deal was we weren't necessarily competitive with each other. We weren't trying to step and claw on the other guy to get up the Hollywood ladder. We were actually interested in working together to help the whole company. And I missed that spirit. Yeah, I've got a few contacts, a few friends that we kind of help each other. It's a very isolated world, isn't it? And I'm always interested in color for the community. Well, there is a community thanks to forums, but it's an isolated job. And I keep my eyes and ears open. I'm always interested in something new. And I think the reason why I've been able to last so long is I try to always be aware of what's happening, what's changing. We're eagerly looking at Resolve 18 and looking at the new features and trying to decide, what can we do to incorporate that in the way we work here? So you mentioned even when you said like, you and me and you both go back to Resolve, you're six and seven. Sure. The resources, we thought were good at the time then, but nothing like you've got now. Now it's that was Tinker Toys. We can find out anything now. Which is great, but do you find it's, you're on it all the time. I mean, you just don't know how it goes, a 48 hour day I think is. Well, I mean, I do work long days in this room. Surprisingly, I'm actually only on the internet, maybe an hour a day. Everyone wants to see kit. I love looking at the studios. Give us a little tour. Obviously it's Resolve centric, but sure. Can you give us a little tour of your favorite things that are here? Love the panels. I tell people who get into Resolve for the first time that really Resolve is so much more powerful when you combine it with a control surface. And Blackmagic gives you the choice of three different panels. I've had this one from day one. I've had this since about three months after we started this office, which is almost been five years. I was about two years until I went for it. What I have to say is the little dirty secret of Resolve and Blackmagic may not agree with me saying this. This is just my opinion. But I think Resolve was really made for the big panel. When you try to use Resolve with anything else, it's a compromise. Now we have other panels. I have the Tangent Wave 2. It's a backup. It sits on a suitcase over there in case we need to do something in a client's office. We have the Mini Panel and a big case over there, big rolling case. And I used the Mini Panel for a long time since it came out. I love the Tangent Element Panel. That was a great panel too. And there are advantages to that. It's very low. It's very flat. It's got a lot of buttons. You combine it with something like the Stream Deck for macros and stuff. There's almost nothing you can't do with it. But then you step up to the Resolve Advanced Panel. It's a whole new world. And I find I can fly through sessions with this thing. It's a lot of money. It's $30,000. But what I have to say is I can go hours and hours. I can go two or three hours and I never look down at the panel. I've memorized where every button is. So all I'm doing is looking at the screen in front of me and worrying about the color. So I'll look at the sky and I'll go, oh, you know what? I need to pull a key off that sky. And I'm not looking down at the panel. I'm maneuvering the mouse, grabbing the blue, adjusting the qualifier, and doing everything you need to do. And boom, I've got what I need and I've moved on to the next shot. And ergonomically, I think, just a little bit, a long session, you know, doing that with your arms a little bit more. Yeah. Then, you know, I did one on the tangent element recently, which is a great panel, but it's very small controls. I feel that way with the Resolve Mini Panel. As good as it is, and it's a great value for what they're doing. $2,000 used to be $3,000. The buttons are very small. The track balls are a little bit smaller. And I find I'm constantly looking down and going, where is that again? Oh, I have to hit this button three times for that menu to come up. Yeah. Although I think with people like me, what people are doing is stream decks now. And I see you've got one as well. Yeah. I've got one. And multiples. I think the Mini, obviously, wasn't around when I bought the Event Power. I think I'd keep my $25,000, just spend $5,000 on the thing and have a few stream decks. You know, there is that. I don't regret buying that kind of thing. I've seen a bit of $5,000 option then. I think I'd have gone back. Yeah. I've seen a few people that have three or four stream decks combined with a mini panel. And I go, well, yeah, that's great. And, you know, I guess that would probably be under $3,000 nowadays. It's still not the equivalent of those. It's not quite the same thing because you have dedicated buttons. I think it's, what is it, 160, 170 buttons? I'll just do an episode of this. I'll shoot it now. I think it's 250. Is it real? Yeah, it's something. Wow. Even more than that. Well, and then. I think you could have put in the soft buttons at some point. And then each button does truth through things. Yes. So you go, my God, it's the equivalent of 700 or 800 buttons. So I mean, it's massive. And I think there is a client factor that you can't overlook. That's true. So when they walk in the room and the clients see the big panels, they go, wow, this is a serious guy. He must know what he's doing. So talk to me some of the main bits of cake. You've got it. Some of the stuff we have is sort of subtle. Like we have, we used to use lit lights, which are very popular in the recording industry. We're using these lights, which I should have known. The media lights. The media light. Thank you. Media light. I've got these myself. The media lights are wonderful because they are 6,500 degrees. So it's real whites. I love them so much. We bought five of them for the room. So I've got one for the client. I've got two for the console. One for me way over here and one for the desk on the other side of the room. Well, I love about these. You can give them, I've got mine set to literally it's like 2%. Yeah. And they don't, that's what we do. I can't buy any lights that go with that. I'm really like, I'm not this little thing. Yeah, yeah. Little thing. I mean, they did everything right. It's great. Plus it's $99. It's fantastic. I just said, so it doesn't lean, doesn't fall over. Yeah, yeah. We're not trying to sell media lights. Yeah, yeah. But I was so pleased with them. I bought them. I didn't even ask for a discount. I said, no, no, no, I will pay less price for these because these are so good. And it's the same company who do, if you've got the same as me, the backlighting on there, which is the strip that you put on. Exactly. And it's really important, the lighting. Obviously we've got your house lights on here just for the video. Yeah, because normally we don't run with the house lights. We got that up for the camera. But it's amazing the number of places in LA. I freelance for four or five different companies in LA on occasion. And it's amazing. They'll usher me into their color room and they're a closet with no lights. And they've got some bad mini panel that's all beat up and cracked. There's a lot of stuff going on. There's dust blowing around and bad monitor for the scopes. And I'm 15 feet away from the color monitor. And it's just a very uncomfortable, awkward place to work in. So we wanted a place where we would be really comfortable. The clients would be comfortable. And we could relax to do the work so it would be that much less stressful. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think this is probably bigger than my suite. I haven't set anything with my suite because you've got a little more kit in it. But it's comparable to this. And I think this is a nice couple of things. The kind things in this area, it's nice. These are important things, not just about the kit. It is. I mean, there are things I wish we had here that we don't have. And the next time we move, we're going to be looking into that. Which is to have a machine room. We have a quiet box over here which is out of view of the camera. The quiet box holds more than 400 terabytes. I will shoot some B-roll after this. Yeah, there you go. 400 terabytes of fast storage. We're big users of GTEC. So we've got G-speed, oh god, what are they called? G-speed shuttles. G-speed shuttle drives all in a RAID 5 configuration. All with Western Digital Red drives. And we recently upgraded one of those to, I think, 120 terabytes. Is that all on at the minute? It is up at the moment. I mean, I can hear it obviously just like background, but it doesn't even have the AC. Yeah, the quiet box encloses quite a bit of that. And it is open to that. And I've actually got to do a crack as I reached into opening it earlier. But what's interesting is we made the decision to go with a G-RAID 0 using SSDs for the everyday project. So each week we go through what we did before, delete the old projects after making sure it's backed up to an actual hard drive. And then we load the new project onto the SSD. The SSD is absolutely bone quiet, incredibly fast. It's over 200 megabits per second. Maybe megabytes, I'm going to have to double check. And it's fast as lightning. We can do 8K, 6K, any kind of KAMD. So I was thinking about transitioning to this sort of work, because you just keep it on there and dump it later. Yeah, that's exactly what we do. And from the viewpoint of heat and noise and speed, it's great. The only thing where it's bad is cost. Cost is ridiculous. We have people that are going out and shooting 20, 30 terabytes. Yeah, I've got to say we were a little bit more selective about what we actually back up now. Because I used to buy a 2 terabyte drive and I could get 10 projects on there. Oh, those days are gone. So what are you using for monitoring? First, for the GUI monitors, we're using Dell Ultra Sharks, which are by far my favorite GUI displays for computers. We actually use them on all our Macs. And even though they're not an Apple brand, we actually prefer them to what Apple sells. Yeah, most ways. And the center monitor is, I believe, an LG. And I want to say it's an odd resolution, like 1200 by 3000 or something like that. It's an odd number. It gives us a super wide display for seeing all the screens. It's really nice actually, because I've got a 34 inch Dell Ultra Wide, which I know, I think you're one of the guilty ones who said, why have you got such a big screen? Do you know what the only reason I've got it is lying around doing nothing. And I've not been bothered to actually change it, but I would like something like that. Yeah, I mean, it's very nice. And I can tell you at most of the commercial facilities in town, all the big guys, Deluxe, Company 3, what used to be Technicolor and related companies like that, a lot of them use a similar configuration where they have the main color monitor in the middle and then scopes immediately below it. I'm kind of an old school guy and then I come from the world of tele-sending back in the days when we actually ran film live and color corrected with computers and external panels. And so I come from a world where we believe and trust the scopes and we use those as God to tell us when we're in trouble. Absolutely. I do as well, but it's, I think there's a little bit of a hype thing because I've got my client monitor up on the wall and I've got my hero monitor. So I don't know how much room I've actually got because I'm only just sort of sitting over the back of this. That's true. I mean, that's always a problem when designing a room. You've got to put your system in based on the limitations of the size of the room, the place in which you have to sit and where your client you're going to sit. We have gone with a smaller monitor, this 32 inch monitor, and we're anticipating getting maybe an FSI or Sony BVM, Dolby Vision monitor at some point in the near future if work demands it. You've got a nice big desk as well, like I am. The desk was incredibly expensive and a lot of trouble and I have to thank our friends over at Simple DCP, which is a local DCP company. It is called Martin and Zeagle. Martin and Zeagle. Okay. Yeah, so I mean, I think my desk is actually an audio console desk. I love, I want a big desk. I want to go to the cook, take the work out. I want to, you know, just, I just want space. That's exactly what we said. And rounded edges. Yeah, the guys at Technicolor, the consoles we used in the old Technicolor building were custom made. And we thought, well, we need something about that good, but maybe not custom. That would be a bit more expensive. Those were three or four thousand dollars. This desk, I want to say was about 17 or $1,800. Yeah. So it was expensive. We did do some custom modifications to drop it a little bit, to make it a little bit lower for our purposes. What I would love to do, we have not done it yet, would be to take the advanced panel and cut a hole for it so that it drops down another couple of inches. A few places around town do that. It's just one of those things we haven't gotten around. I wouldn't come at you. I'm sure you've got the back with the... I think that's, I think that's what my partner Henry said. He goes, oh, you have no idea how complicated it is. It does panel. Yeah. Oh, is this to set the reflection? Well, also it's to cover up the ugliness. No, no, no. Right. I thought you were being smart. It had a nice cover for your thing, because I think at 30,000 dollars, they should come with a cover. You know, I talked to Black... I've been watching that, yeah. I talked to Black Magic about it, and they said, you know, we would rather you not cover the advanced panel because we're worried that it'll get hot. I said, we had somebody who... I wasn't going to use it with a cover on. Well, they had, they had somebody who put a vinyl cover on it, and the LED screens got very hot over a weekend, and they came back. I don't think it melted, but it was starting to malfunction because of the heat. I switched my mouth. That's what we did. Well, actually, a screen saver kicks in. Are we hearing something? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I could speak. Oh, that's possible. This is a weird old... It's because you always have colorists and not audio. This is a weird old building. There's all kinds of strange things. So, apologies for the little squeaky, weird noise, but I'm not going to be cutting that out. I'm editing this in my hotel room, so you're going to get what you get. So, what am I spying over here? A bit of new kit. Yes, we have a new Mac Studio, which we're going to be using to replace two Mac Minis, which are hidden behind this monitor. We use the Mac Mini as a PostgreSQL server as a project manager, and the second Mac Mini is used for scopes. So, what we're going to be doing with the Mac Studio is doing both things in one computer. Now, it's kind of overkill to use a Mac Studio for all that. I'm going to say it's quite cheesy. You're not going to be using it for running results. But you know what? It's a good backup system, and we are going to put Resolve on there just in case we run into a trouble. We're running into a bit of trouble. We also have the old Trashcan Mac from 2013, and believe it or not, we still use that for conforming and for creating H.264s for uploading to Frame.io and things like that. Well, that's now my beta machine, so that's what I use. So, that's what version 18 has just come out. That's what that's come out. For our beta machine, I have a MacBook Pro M1 Max, which is on the opposite side of the room, and we are running the beta of Resolve 18 on that. And I have to say, I don't think the MacBook Pro would be my first choice to run Resolve, but having said that, it's amazing for what it does and for the amount of money it costs. And for small tasks, for little projects, it's okay. I wouldn't trust the screen, but there's a lot of controversy on the net as to whether or not you can believe and trust the monitor that Apple gives you on the MacBook Pros. For my money, no, they are not good enough. We spend a lot of money on calibration and getting good color monitors. I don't think the MacBook Pros are quite there yet. And there's a lot of reasons not to trust the GUI. But then I get people saying, well, I'm only doing stuff for YouTube and for my high school or for this thing or that thing. And you go, well, try it and see if it works for you. It would not be my choice. I could do 20 episodes on this. Well, I mean, it is sad. And unfortunately, there are people on the net who don't want to hear the truth. No, I think as long as you are aware of the limitations, you are aware that this is not 100% true necessarily. So you have quite a fine array of movie posters here. And I noticed many of them are signed, actually, by the looks of them. Yeah. And my joke is these are reminders of the huge struggle and strain and stress of getting through all those projects in the color room. And I mean, on the one hand, we think of the fun and the entertainment and the joy in seeing these things on the big screen. But I also remember every pixel, every blemish, every screaming argument that went along to get these movies done. But if nothing else, it's a reminder, this is part of my career, at least the posters for which I could get some living examples. And I was able to get some of the directors and DPs and so on to autograph them for me. So if you could only have one, for whatever reason, which one would you take? Well, I got to say Don Coscarelli over here on Beastmaster. I've got to say I'm loving that one. Don Don was very nice and practically wrote an entire paragraph. I said, hey, can you autograph this for me? And he goes, oh, I'm going to do a lot more. He said, you were responsible for making this movie the best it's looked in 30 years. So he was very complimentary and a sweet, wonderful guy. But that was another 100-hour project. It just took forever when we were pushing pixels around for a while. But end result was worth it. And as long as the movie looks better than it ever has, I'm happy. Well, Mark, it's been brilliant talking to you. I know you're a busy man. Oh, thank you. It's really good to see you. And it's been three years, I think, since the last time. Yeah, at least. So, you know, Chrome is growing each time I come. I hope the next time you visit, we have a machine room, which we desperately need, and maybe a second color room. Fantastic. Now, we'll check your hand, but it looks like you've got a bit of it. Oh, yes. Carpal tunnel syndrome, which is an occupational hazard. Any of you colorists out there who are independent and so on, take frequent breaks, don't lean on your hands and listen to your doctor. You hit fast, folks. All right, pleasure. All right. Well, thank you so much.
