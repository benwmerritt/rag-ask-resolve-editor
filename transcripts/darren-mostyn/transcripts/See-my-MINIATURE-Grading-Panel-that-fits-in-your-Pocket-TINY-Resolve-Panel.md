So it's been seven years since the micro panel and the mini panel were introduced for DaVinci Resolve and with NAB literally next week, this is when the big announcements get made. So what we're looking for is really an advanced panel that's cheaper, smaller and with all the functionality and I think I might have found it. So this must be the most portable control surface yet for DaVinci Resolve. All the features of the advanced panel and it fits in your pocket. Hey there, great to see you again. You too. Second time you've been to my studio. Yeah. First time was to measure up my advanced panel to make this fantastic miniature model. I absolutely love it. You absolutely smashed that. Oh great, honoured to be asked to do it. So we met at a party. We did. Friends party and when people ask what I do for a living, they normally think it's a little bit weird. Yeah. When I find out what you do for a living, it's different league. What's different? What tell us what you do. It's quite niche. I'd like to say I'm a miniature model maker or a miniaturist. So how does one become a miniaturist model maker? It was just during lockdown. I started making a few things and wanted to learn more about it and just pored over YouTube tutorials and just taught myself every day I'd make something. In fact, I still do, actually every day. Well, you absolutely know that. I've the attention to detail on this. You've got the T bar, all of the little rings are all raised. You even got the USB and the power connections on the back. Yeah, it's the little things that make it. So I know a lot of your commissions are people's houses. Yeah. That's one thing. So how does a technical piece like this compare to doing someone's house? The houses, obviously, people adore their houses. That's why it's quite a difficult commission to do because you have to make it perfect. But also with this one, talking to you beforehand and seeing how passionate you are, it had to be exactly right. And it did take a few takes. I must admit, because I was like, you're so passionate about what you do. It had to be perfect. I'm absolutely thrilled with it, honestly. And then you even added a little Da Vinci Resolve for Dummies. In case you get stuck. Written by Darren Moss. In case I get stuck. Yeah, thank you. I'll look into that. So this piece, I asked you to bring this in today because I saw this on your Instagram. I love it. This is my favorite piece you've done so far. I mean, all your work is amazing. But for me, there's something about it. Like we're both from Manchester, we're both from the north. People don't know where Manchester is. North of England. And this is an actual road sign off the M1, which is the main motorway up. And just seeing the words, the north just like really warmed me. It's like made me, to be back to my childhood almost, you know. That's what I love. That's my passion is nostalgia and to be able to shrink something makes you feel like, yeah. And as soon as I see the north, even though we live in Brighton now, yeah, there's something about seeing that. Yeah, I mean, Brighton's great. The north seeing the north makes you feel a certain way going on. Yeah, going on. So where can people find you at my Instagram account, which is little papa underscore dollhouse. I'll put links that in the description. Check it out on Instagram. It's a fantastic account. Thanks so much for coming in. Thank you. As always. Thank you. Take care. Next party. Yeah. So I'm flying out to NAB next week. Anyway, this is where all the big announcements are made. So who knows, maybe there will be a new panel in the meanwhile. This one's going proudly on display in the studio. If you ever passing by, come and have a look at it. Check out if it's Instagram sites, look after yourselves and I'll see you in Vegas.
