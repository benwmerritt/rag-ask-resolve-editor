## Transcript
So this is a really exciting episode. I've just discovered a brand new tool in DaVinci Resolve. I've just used it on a job. I can't wait to show you how it works. So let's get straight into it. All right, the shot you're looking at here, this has been shot on 16 mil film. We get that beautiful tones in here. We've got that beautiful rich reds and this is really only achieved using analog film. So we are always trying to in our digital world emulate that and get as close as we can to this gorgeous look that we've got here. But you get these really beautiful dense reds. I'm going to show you how I do that traditionally and I'm going to show you this brand new tool that I've just discovered. This has been shot S log three. So this is Sony S log three. I've got here my traditional sort of workflow. So I've got a CST at the beginning taking me from Sony S log three to DaVinci wide gamut. And then at the end I'm going to DaVinci wide gamut down to req 709. And everything in the middle is basically working DaVinci wide gamut color space. All right, so we're working in a nice large color space. Now there are many ways to achieve that sort of film look at the end here. I've got my Kodak 2383 LUT. I'm using a enhancer to do that. You can use the one that's built into DaVinci Resolve. And the best way to get those reds looking not like this, but more like this is start using the curves. So I'm going to go down to my curves here and I'm going to go straight to this one, which is hue versus loom. And let me show you what I would do here. So we want a nice broad selection. So I'm not going to actually sample her red coats here. I'm going to take the red here and I'm just going to start pulling this down and we get that really nice dense red that we're kind of getting on the phone here. So you can see that's working really well. But we also need to be careful in here because our hue versus loom curve here is actually affecting skin tones. But I have now discovered a brand new tool. So let me show you the difference with this. What I'm going to do is I'm going to create a brand new version of this. If you don't know how to do that, what I'm basically doing is going to hit color and say grade version. I'm going to say add. What that will do is it will copy the node structure that I've got already and do a new version so I can compare them side by side. What I'm going to do is I'm going to get rid of that hue versus luminance movement that we've just done on the curves and I'm going to apply this new effect. All right. So what is this new effect? If we come to our effects, which you'll find just here and down here, there's one called DCTL. Now DCTL stands for DaVinci Color Transform Language and it basically allows programmers, developers, particularly color scientists to access all the tools in DaVinci Resolve and make their own effects. So this is what I've just discovered. So this is fantastic. So a DCTL is installed a little bit like a LUT. So by default, if I drag this on to a node, it would just say none because I haven't got any DCTLs installed. Now what I've done is I've downloaded a DCTL from a site called mononodes.com. I'm going to put a link to that in the description and a really smart guy called Stefan Rhingeschwantner has designed this fantastic DCTL called ColorShift. He's got two or three on his site actually, but ColorShift is the one that I've been playing with. So let me just show you quickly how to install it and then I'm going to show you how fantastic it works. All right. So I'm going to go down to my Finder. So I've downloaded the Zip files from Stefan's site and I'm left with these two files. So I've got Mono, ColorShift, Version 2 and Mono, ColorShift, Version 2, NE. Now the NE stands for non-emoji. The icons, when you install this as a DCTL, the icons that are there are actually emojis. And Stefan's found a small bug that some of the panels will disconnect if you use the emojis. So he's got a non-emoji version, which works 100%. I've been using the one with emojis and it's not doing any problems with my panel. It's all my panels working absolutely fine. I've done a full job with this already. So anyway, you need to install these in the LUTs folder. These are not LUTs, but that's where they sit. So how do you find the LUTs folder? The easiest way is go to your settings, go to your color management and down here you've got Open LUT folder. And then what you can do is literally drag and drop these into that folder. Now I've already done it, so I'm not going to do it again. And then you need to restart DaVinci Resolve. You must restart the system. And then once you've restarted DaVinci Resolve, your DCTL list will be populated. So down here I've got all the ones that I've downloaded. So the color shift pack that I've downloaded has got about 10 different DCTLs in there. The first main one that I've been using, the one that I'm excited about, is this one called Density. All right, and this is a really quick way of getting these reds look like this. All right, so let me show you. I've got two. I've got Monodensity T, this is version 2.1, and Monodensity just straight. The T stands for Tetrahedral. So that is the color maths, the color model that it's working in when it's doing its calculations. Okay, now there's no right or wrong one to use. I've checked this with Stefan and you basically, they both have a slightly different effect. You choose the one to suit. All right, so I'm going to go for Monodensity T and up comes this. Now these are the emojis that was talking about. Okay, they look like just regular icons, but they're actually emojis. So what I've now got is these fantastic, easy to use six vexus sliders. Okay, and all I've got to do is go to my red density and literally start moving this down and look at those colors going. So I'm matching this phone. These look absolutely fantastic with just one slider. So this is allowing me to do what I was doing with the Hue Viscous Lume and some of the other tools that I'd have to do, but it just looks much more natural. It looks like film. So this is what I was getting excited about. Now the other thing that's happening, if I just get rid of the phone now, I think you'll all agree that this is a very good dense red. You're not losing saturation. You're keeping that really rich filmic look. Now I'm going to take that off and what is happening if I just enable and disable this node is it's actually affecting her face here. Okay, so we need to be careful of that. So what you can do is come down to the bottom here and you've got this thing called Deep. And if I move this slider up, it basically starts excluding highlights from the maths as it were. So as I move this up and then I can adjust my density accordingly. And now if I enable and disable this, it's not affecting so much of her skin tone. So we're getting this beautiful rich deep red. Now if I compare this to the version that we did with our Hue Viscous Lume, you'll see the difference. So I'm just going to use my panel to do that. That's with Hue Viscous Lume and this is with the DCTL. There's a big difference in just how this actually looks on here. It's fantastic. And this is just one of the 10 different DCTLs that you get in here. Stefan has also done a full episode on his YouTube channel that explains exactly how each of these sliders work. So go ahead and have a look at that. You can also download a free demo version of it so you can try it out. It is Watermarked, but you can try it out and see if you like it. And Stefan has also given me a discount code here, which I'm going to pass on to you at the end of this episode. So if you're interested in buying it, you can get yourself a discount. But let me just show you another tip with this. I'm going to go to my next clip and again, I'm going to take this DCTL. I'm going to drag and drop it on here. It's best to work with the DCTLs in a wider color space. You want to be working in a large color space. You want to be working in arry wide gametes, aces, DaVinci wide gametes, something like that. It will work in Rex 709 color space, but the sliders tend to be quite aggressive. So you really want to be in a larger color space. So again, here I've got my input. This is area Alexa going to DaVinci wide gametes. My nodes in the middle are all working in DaVinci wide gametes. And then I'm going to DaVinci wide gametes back down to Rex 709. If you don't follow this, have a look at my episodes on using CSTs. All right. So let's have a look at one of the other ones. So if I come down here, we've also got this one called Hue shift. All right. So what we can do is we can look at his jacket here and maybe make it a little bit more cyan. So I've got here, I can do a cyan hue shift. Just moving this like this. But there's a more intelligent one than that. So I'm going to reset that and I'm going to select this one here. Now what this one does is it gives me all the options already. So I've got cyan to blue, blue to cyan. This is the one I want to use. So I'm going to move this slider and you get a much more pleasing look than I would if I use the Hue versus Hue tool. So let me show you that. So this is using the blue to cyan. Okay. I'm going to do another version. I'm going to disable that one and I go to my Hue versus Hue tool. I'm going to sample his jacket. And I'm going to move it up and you can see that the jump to cyan, you actually get this almost greeny. You get a sort of much more green tint on it. Let me just spread that out a little bit more to be fair. But the cyan is not quite as pleasing as it is using the DCTL. So these DCTLs have been designed with color science in mind. Stefan is a color scientist. He knows what he's doing. He's a DaVinci Resolve master trainer as well. And they are designed to also work with look development. So the nice thing with this is you would have your DCTL somewhere near the end of your notary and you would be working underneath that. So that would be part of your look development. So you can see why I'm getting so excited about this new tool. That density feature is absolutely fantastic. Now Stefan has given me a 10% discount code to pass on to you. If you type the word Darren, D-A-W-R-E-N at the checkout, you'll get 10% off any of his DCTLs. So I just want to say a huge thank you to Stefan for actually developing this DCTL in the first place and making all my projects look so much better moving forward. Give it a try. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
