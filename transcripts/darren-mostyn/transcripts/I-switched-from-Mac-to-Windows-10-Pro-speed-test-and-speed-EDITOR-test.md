So this episode is a little bit different. I get quite a few comments on my channel about why do I spend so much money on a Mac Pro 2019 when I could have got a Windows machine for a fraction of the price and The answer is I like using Macs basically we do have Windows machines here I've got a HP Z4 here, which we use for our Avid But it's not got enough power in it to use with resolve really it does work, but not not that powerful So scan pro video got in touch with me and said would I like to road test one of their 3xs machines? That's their sort of high-end computers and give it a go with resolve so they've sent me one really nicely specced out and I'm going to run the exact project that I ran for my original YouTube back in June 2020 Where I tested the performance of the 2019 Mac Pro versus the 2013 Mac Pro. So here's the spec This is the scan pro video 3xs system. It's running Microsoft Windows Pro 10 and This one is built on their website basically you go to a configurator I'll put a link into the description and you choose which application you're using so we're using DaVinci Resolve and it will then give you various options that you can choose from and You build up the system that you want the crew at scan will then build that they tweak the BIOS for best performance They get it all tested and shipped out to you So the version we've got here is not quite the maxed out one, but it's it's of good specs So we're running the AMD Ryzen 9 5950 X 16 core processor Sitting on that is an RTX 3090 graphics card. I've heard a lot of good things about these cards So I'm looking forward to seeing the performance of this It's got 128 gigs of RAM inside it comes with a whole box of cables and things as well So if you want to upgrade in the future, there's a whole ton of cables and connectors and stuff in there One of the nice things with the chassis the chassis is really large on this system. So it's got lots of ventilation in there It's much bigger than my HPZ 4 machine that we're running here But one good thing I noticed is the amount of connections that you've got it's got really good connectivity and when I got my Mac Pro 2019 I had to go straight away and buy two cable adapters because it was quite limited on the connections on the back So on the top here you've got two USB 3s. You've got USB C You've got four display ports on the back six USBs on the back two than about threes You've got HDMI out and you've also got an inbuilt 10 gigabit ethernet connection So you wouldn't need a dedicated card for that So I've been running with this for a couple of days now and it's been rock solid So let's have a look at some of the performance tests now. I've got several shots in here I've got these four shots here, which are ultra HD. This is Canon C200 Canon C300. This is a Sony a7s 3 and we've also got a GoPro in there again running at ultra HD so I'm going to run these as a kind of multi cam sequence using the speed editor and That'll be our first test and the second test I'm going to do is the exact same test that I did on my first ever YouTube video Which was a test of the Mac Pro 2013 and 2019 I'm going to see how well this performs using exactly the same project. So let's start off with our multi cam sequence so I'm going to go into my cut page and What I'm going to do is sync these up first So what we have to do is highlight all the clips in The bin if you have other clips in this bin you need to put them into its own bin So you can right-hand click and say create bin with selected clips What I'm going to do now is hit this button here and it's going to sync these clips up now All I have to do is press sync here I've got audio on all four of these clips and it should automatically detect that and line those clips up accordingly So I'm going to press sync and let's see how quick it does it Okay, that is miles faster than my Mac Pro did that. I'm quite amazed at how quick that did that My Mac Pro has to think about that quite a little bit So that would probably take maybe five ten seconds. That was really quick These are about three minutes long these shots about three and a half minutes long So that is now hopefully Sinked all those up and what we can do now is just say save sync What I'm going to do is select just the a camera because this is the camera that had the correct audio on it from the shoot and I'm going to deselect this because that's video only and I'm also going to apply this button here I'll show you why so I'm going to take my a camera I'm going to append that to my timeline and let's just have a little scroll through And that's behaving really nice and smooth and what I want to do is trim off the front before Gem actually starts speaking so I'm going to press trim in and because I've selected this icon I get a nice enlarged view of the waveform. So this is really cool So you can actually see the start of the video. So that's now perfectly lined up press play So I'm going to show you how to make my Ultimate bowl of food perfect, right. Let's get some extra cameras in there. So what I'm going to do is press sync bin And that allows me to see my other angles. So let's strut away going for let's go for angle to So there's several ways I can work with this. I can now press. I want video only I'm going to press Camera to and I can press sync over right and what that will do is add five seconds of that shot to video layer too So let's have a quick look at that I need to play on my time line Right now at that point there, let's have a look at the ingredients So I'm going to go to my sync bin and that is shot three now what I can do is Do this in a different way. I'm going to do live over right. I'm going to press camera three and you literally Paint it on so this is really nice because you can choose how long it's not five seconds It's however long you want it to be and press timelines come out of there Scroll that back and now we've got three layers Which isn't only nutritionally balanced And at that point there we're going to cut back to her there in fact what I'm going to do I'm just going to stick on this track here just so we build up four layers I know back to my sync bin and let's choose camera One which is the Sony a7s 3 I'm gonna press live over right again camera one And let's just paint that on back to my timeline scroll back You see how really quick this is the systems behaving really well. I've got my speed editor going So let's say I want to trim this shot here I'm not happy with where that comes in what I can do if you press the camera angle for the layer that you want to affect That will affect the trim so if I press camera three that affects level level three And then I'm gonna get to the beginning of that press trim in and We can adjust that trim point So just to show you again if I want to select layer two I press camera to Trim in and I can just pull that in or trim out So there we have our four layers playing back really smoothly 4k our project is set to ultra HD So just to show you that we were working in ultra HD and I'm really pleased with that So let's have a look at the other sets in fact what I'll do on here Let's just play an 8k clip just before I go and do the proper test So in the media pool if I click on here, I've actually got an 8k clip in here. So this is red weapon And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna edit that in Let's just take a few moments of that so I'm gonna do a mark in And mark out that's playing that really nice and smooth and what I can then do Is get to my timeline Let's just put that on top of those four tracks. So I'm gonna do place on top just here That's my time line. So we've now played four streams of 4k and four streams of ultra HD. Sorry and an 8k Perfect so no problems at all. It's playing back really nice Now what I want to do now is run the test that I did back in June on the Mac Pro 2019 I've got that loaded up already so I'm gonna do this performance test here and I'll just give you a recap if you haven't seen that video, but basically we've got a series of clips It's a one-minute timeline. The timeline is set to ultra HD and I'm basically doing various different things on here so these are Canon raw clips and I've basically just done regular style grading on them There's 16 17 odd layers going on there on each one a bit of keying that sort of stuff on This shot here. This is a compound clip on what I've done here if I get to the edit page I've taken a Pro res 42 hq file and I've duplicated it 16 times So if I right-hand click in here, I can decompose That compound clip and just show you there I've got 16 layers of video and each layer has got its own different grade on there So the sharpening blur that sort of thing if I go to the color page You can see there's my 16 layers and each one has got its own different property on there so that's hopefully gonna stress the system out a little bit and Give us a true idea of its sort of performance and the next clip down here. Let me just put that decompose back in place Just right-hand click and say new compound clip and The way that I can see all these layers neatly is by clicking on here and you can expand or Reduce your video track height, which is quite useful Then let's go to my color page and look at the next shot here. This is just Canon raw again I've got some open effects going on here. I've got color space transform So this is my regular style sort of grading just to test the system out I've got a h264 gopro clip here as well just to help and I've also got one here that's got some fusion work on it So if we go to fusion so not only has it got the CSTs and some grade But if we go to fusion you'll see I've got glow color correction. It's a text file There's a defocus all that sort of stuff So again just to test the system and finally we've got a black magic 4.6k raw file with What looks like about 10 12 layers of grade on it? So we're gonna render this out now to the deliver page. So I'm gonna set this to be DNx HR I'm gonna do it DNx HR 444 10 bit which is comparable to the ProRes 4444 that I did on the macro 2019 test I'm gonna call this 3x that's Windows test and let's just add that to the render queue and let's see how quick this does this This is the moment of truth. So I'm gonna press render and let's see Okay, so that completed in 48 seconds So this scam pro video system is quite clearly up there with my Mac Pro 2019 and it's coming in at a third of the price So this system is just under 5,000 pounds including VAT. So that is a third of the price of my Mac Pro 2019 The crew at scan video been really helpful as well. They know their stuff There's a guy called Alistair there who used to work for black magic design. He's part of the scam pro video team So you're in good hands. I've put a link in the description to scan What else the Windows experience overall there's a there's quite a cool feature in Windows 10 Pro that is called bit locker and basically if I have my laptop on set and it got stolen Unless you know my particular login all my files are encrypted automatically So that's quite a nice little secure feature and obviously the whole Windows system with the chassis you can upgrade You know, I've got much more choice of Graphics cards and fine-tuning the performance exactly how I want over the Mac system I'm gonna go and rush out and replace all my Macs probably not we've had them a long time I've just invested quite heavily in the pro 2019, but I have enjoyed using this I hope you enjoyed that little performance test and look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode
