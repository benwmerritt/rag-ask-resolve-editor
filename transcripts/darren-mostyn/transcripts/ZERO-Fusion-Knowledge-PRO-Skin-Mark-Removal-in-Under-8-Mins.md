So, I've been a professional colorist for many, many years now and occasionally you get a client request that requires you to go beyond your regular sort of color grading duties. And this has just happened to me this week. So I thought I'd record this episode and share with you the techniques that I used to get around this issue. So the problem we had was it was a music video and the lead singer, the lead artist, had a scar on her lip and she wanted it removed for the whole video. So I needed to find a technique that was going to work reliably and consistently. And I'm going to share that with you in this episode. Now I can't show you the actual music video that I worked on because it's not even been released yet, but I can show you exactly the technique I did using another clip. Now in order to remove this scar, I make it look convincing across the whole music video, required me to go into fusion. Now I'm no expert in fusion at all. I hardly know anything in fusion, but I have learned a few really good techniques that I can use in situations like this. Now usually this sort of thing would be sent to a VFX artist, but because I already knew how to do it in fusion and we agreed on time allocation in the color grade, I was able to do it really quickly and keep my client happy. So I'm going to use this shot here and what we're going to do is remove this tattoo. I'm going to use exactly the same techniques that I used to remove the scar in the music video. Let's first of all check the shot. What's happening? So as we play through, you'll see that the arm moves, which means we've got to track the tattoo. And just to show you what's going on with color management, I'm going from Canon to Canon log. We're going up to DaVinci wide gamut here and then I've got a couple of nodes just to keep it simple. And then we're going DaVinci wide gamut down to Rick 709, gamma 2.2 in this instance. And then I've got a balance node here just taking me from here to here. And then I've got one spare node here. Probably the easiest way to get rid of this tattoo, there's several different ways you could do it is to go to the patch replacer. So I'm opening up my effects library, come down the bottom here and you can't find it. The easiest way is just to go to the search bar, type in patch and there it is. And then drag and drop this onto this empty node. Now there's many tools in here to get really good accuracy, but I'm just going to do this quite quickly and just show you what's going to go on. So this one here, we can change the shape and the size and all that sort of stuff here, but this is going to sit on my tattoo itself. So that's the object I want to remove. And this is the patch that I'm going to sample in order to make it look convincing. So that's what's happening. So if I switch that off, there's the tattoo and there's the patch replacer. So let's just press play and you see obviously it's moving. So we need to track this. So what I'm going to do is go to my tracker. I'm going to use the effects tracker here. So by default, it will be on the window. I'm going to go to the effects tracker here and I'm going to use the new IntelliTracker actually not a point tracker. Let's use the IntelliTrack. And what the effects tracker allows me to do is to track effects that have been placed on. So I'm going to press this here to give me a tracking point. I'm going to drag this onto the tattoo. Now the tattoo will be a really good thing to track, but we can't actually see it at the minute because I've got my patch replacer set on top of it. So I'm going to switch that off just momentarily. So all I've done is disable it, put that on the tattoo and then just press track. And that has given us a really good track on there. Put the patch replacer back on. And as you can see, we've done a really good job of removing that tattoo. So why did I do it in fusion? Why not just use the patch replacer because it's nice and simple and fast. The reason being, during the whole music video, there's obviously a lot going on. So I needed a bit more accuracy than something like this. This is quite sort of large area. You can make it a bit smaller, but the shape and everything, I wanted to use more of a paint type tool to do some proper cloning. So that's why I went into fusion. So let's have a look at exactly what I did. So over to the fusion page. And as you know, fusion is a fantastic compositing system, but it is a very heavy application. It takes hours, if not days, to learn what it's capable of doing. If you want to learn more in depth on fusion, I suggest on YouTube, you have a look at Patrick Sterling, Casey Farris, Burn Climbed, people like that. They absolutely know fusion inside out. I definitely don't. So I'm going to show you just a few little things that I do know. And forgive my terminology as well. I don't even know what the tools are called correctly, but just follow me step by step. All right. So we've got a media in and we've got a media out. Actually, the first thing you'll notice is from the color page, we're not actually getting the color information. And that is because the fusion page is processed before the color page. So a quick trick with this, if you want to see it in full color, if you go to the edit page here, you can right-hand click on here and say new compound clip. And that then puts a wrapper around it, which puts the information into the fusion page. And to undo that, if you want to do some more editing in there, you can right-hand click and just say decompose or open in timeline. There's two options in there. Okay. Back to the fusion page. What is my media in and my media out? So that's basically fusion in, fusion out. And anything we do in the middle is our effects work. So shift and spacebar brings up the selector tool. And I've already typed in paint because it's the paint tool that I want. And it's the cloning capability of the paint tool that I'm particularly after. This is how I got rid of that scar. That's how I'm going to get rid of this tattoo. So in order to do that, I need to change the tool up here, not to be paint up here, but to be this one, which is clone. And I'm also going to use a single brush stroke from up here. Just check my brush size. So I want something, I've probably wanted about what is a default, actually. I think for the scar, I had that a little bit smaller. And I'm just going to zoom in here a little bit as well. Now, in order to do the cloning, what I need to do is press option to choose my sample point. So I'm going to do it from very near the tattoo to keep it convincing. And then let go of option and just start painting. Okay. And I'm going to do the other side. So I'm going to press option again from this side. And the softness is what's helping blend it. So something like that. Now I've just actually gone a little bit too far and I've added a bit of tattoo back in. Because obviously it's sampling from the source. Something like that. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to select all the brush strokes I've just done. I did three or four different brush strokes there because I need to track this. Obviously this arm moves. So I'm going to group these together. So if I click up here and press this, it's going to make a paint group. So I've got paint group one. And now all I need to do, if you right hand click on the center here, you can say modify with and I'm going to go to my tracker. This is giving me a tracking point now. And if I go to my modifier, because the tracker is a modifier, then I've got all these tools in here to start doing a really good track. Now the tracker infusion is absolutely fantastic. And we've got the IntelliTrack as well. And at the moment, there's nothing actually selected. So I just need to tell the tracker where to get its information from. So I'm going to type in the tracker source. You can type it in or in fact, I need it to be meted in one. You can just drag and drop that word into there. And now you see it's going to track the tattoo. So I'm just going to press track. And it's going to go ahead and do that. And all being well, that's going to look fantastic. And that is done. So that's all I had to do. So I'm going to go now to the color page and have a look at it. I'm going to take off this. And we've got the patch replacer gone and we've got a really good job on there. I could make that a little bit more accurate if I want to. And just one tip, actually, if I press this button here, that gets rid of the grade and you can see the tattoo. But if I put that back on, what you can do is right click here and remove color from the bypass. And now what it's going to do is just bypass the fusion. So you get a really good way of seeing what's going on here. And if you press shift and D, that will show you what's going on. So that's how I was checking all the scars. So the reason I did all that removal in fusion and not using the patch replacer is because I get much more accuracy. I can fine tune with my pen down to pretty much pixel level, whereas the patch replacer is more of a shape. So if you've got anything out of this at all, please think about subscribing. It's really important to me. It means that I know I'm delivering the right sort of content for you. If you want to see some more of the effects videos, there'll be appearing somewhere around about here. And if you want some more of these, like using fusion without understanding fusion type videos, let me know in the comments what you'd like to see particularly. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
