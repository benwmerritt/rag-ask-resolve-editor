## Transcript
Hi, hope you're all having a good holiday and festive break so far. I've just popped into the studio for a few hours to prep for Wednesday. So this coming Wednesday, the 30th at 7pm GMT, I'm going to do my first ever live. So I'm going to show you all the kit that I've got in the grading suite, every single piece in detail, and open up the chat for tips and tricks and just general banter and questions. So I hope you can join me. And so 7 o'clock this Wednesday, and just to leave you with another little tip, I've been playing with the speed editor today. I couldn't resist just having a quick go on it. So I'm going to leave you with a quick tip that I found in that. So I've been playing with the speed editor for a short while and some of the keys have a double function. So audio level, for example, if you press it twice will be mark. So in the edit page, if I just press, if I just double click that, that will give me a marker. But what's really cool is if I go to the cut page, play along a little bit, if I do the same thing, but hold it down, if I use my jog wheel, I can actually change the color of the marker, which is really cool. So I hope you enjoyed that little tip. I'm going to do a full detail speed editor, full review, full overview of all the functionality. And that will be probably my next episode. So hopefully see you on Wednesday and look after yourselves.
