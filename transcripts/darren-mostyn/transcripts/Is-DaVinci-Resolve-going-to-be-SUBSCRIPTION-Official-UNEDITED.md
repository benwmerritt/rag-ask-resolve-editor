So I'm Stuart from Blackmagic Design Europe and I just want to ask you a quick question about the subscription update thing that was announced. As you can see this is a really big release and there's even more features than this. So DaVinci Resolve 20 is free to download. The paid version of DaVinci Resolve 20 is also free. We'll probably eventually charge some kind of upgrade for this but for the moment we're still doing the DaVinci Resolve 20 upgrade free. Now as you know I've been on Resolve for 15 years and I think when you introduced the first subscription model I bought my license then. I've never paid since which has been a real major plus point for Blackmagic, no subscription model. So what's he, what do you think he's talking about? Okay so there's two different things. We've got subscription and then you've got upgrade fees. There's no intention to go to a subscription model. That's not something that we've talked about. What ground we're talking about was that at some point in the future there may be a small charge for an upgrade fee. So at the moment we're in version 20 there's no plans in the near future to go say okay we're now going to upgrade 21 is going to be x 22 is going to be y. This is really just a, just a, oh something that Grant is trying to do to be honest and open about people moving forward. I think when you look at the volume of tools that have been implemented into version 20 and we're also looking at a number of engineers and the team that we've built to really support these new features all that obviously comes at a cost. And I think that for us what we want to try and make sure is that we continue to deliver the best possible features for all of our customers and if we were to do an upgrade fee it would be very very small. But certainly also at the same time what we wouldn't want to do is alienate existing users who've already purchased the software. So it wouldn't be a case of going okay we're going to charge an upgrade fee and everybody has to pay that amount. If you don't want to pay for that upgrade fee then clearly you won't have to pay for it. I mean to be fair I've had probably 10 new versions of software out of that original fee so I don't think it's that unjust but obviously one of the big sales has always been that you're not a subscription model. So you so it wouldn't be necessary subscription you're talking about one off fees. Exactly it'd be one off fee. I mean for us we've always been about keeping everything open as possible and making sure that everybody has access to these tools. I mean obviously the free version does 80 90 percent of what the full version does. We've been running this under the black magic name since version 7 it's version 20 now. So you know there's been a huge amount of investment time put in it. So for us it's about making sure that we can continue to deliver the best tools if we do put something in place in the future which is an upgrade fee as I say it will be very small. Cool I appreciate your time. No problem thank you very much. I'll see you at the bar later. Cheers.
