So Resolve 17 has been out for nearly a week and the reaction has been fantastic. My name is Darren Mostyn and I want to show you some of the more subtle things in there. I've got about six or seven things that I want to show you that I think will really improve your workflow and efficiency in Resolve 17. So let's go and take a look. So in the edit page if we go to the inspector and if we want to do some cropping, what do you find if we just set a crop up here, as soon as you then want to reframe that, so we go to our zoom tool here, then the crop moves with it and that's because it's transformed first and then cropping. Now if I reset that, if you press here retain image position, it virtually swaps the order. So now cropping comes first and the zooming is second. So now you can reframe your shot inside the crop. So the next feature is really useful. I've got a whole series of timelines here and when you're viewing them above the viewer, you see them in the order that they were opened and this is the same in the color page. Now I've seen lists that are much longer than this and sometimes it's quite hard to find the sequence that you want to work on. So what you can do now is go into your preferences and you've got a timeline sort order. This is in your user preferences UI settings and you see defaults to recently used but I can change that to be either creation date or even more useful to me is alphabetical order. So if I save that now. So this list is now in alphabetical order and if you move over to the color page, you've got exactly the same thing. So when you're toggling between different timelines, it makes finding your sequence that much easier and I've worked on projects where there's been 30 or 40 of these in a list so it really does help. So this next feature is really going to help you if you don't have a control surface because you're relying on your pen or your mouse to make moves in, for example, contrast here. So this is the actual grade from this job but I've just added an extra serial node here just to demonstrate this. So you're either moving left and right to just contrast here and if I reset that by double clicking here, this new feature allows you to double click inside and then use your arrow keys to increment up and down in small steps and also you can use your left and right arrow keys to move decimal points. So I'm now making broader strokes. If I click here, I'm making much broader strokes. So that's a really cool way of making fine adjustments without having to rely on your pen and mouse. So if I reset that, I'll also show you that that works with the open effects as well. So if we go into here and I'm going to add a contrast pop. I find with contrast pop, you only need a small amount of movement in here to get quite a lot of effect. So if I just disable that node, you see already we're affecting these steps quite broadly. So what I'm going to do, this is a great one to use this new feature with. So if I just click in here, I just want to show you that it does work with the open effects as well. So it's great. So let's just bring that down to maybe there. I'm just going to disable and enable that node. And what I'm finding here is it's a little bit too strong on her face, maybe even her body as well. So what I'm going to do is use a power window to isolate that. So let's go into our window. And I'm going to choose a curve. What we can do is draw around us. Now this is another new feature. You've got much better control on the curves when you're doing this sort of thing, because now you can now go back to a previous point that you've made before you've closed the curve off. So you used to have to close it off first and then make the adjustments. But now. It's much better. You can actually just move back to any point that you want, make an adjustment and then carry on making your shape. So this and then I'm going to close it now by clicking there and that's done. So it's just much more accurate. You used to find it would try and join on to the end and it just became a little bit awkward sometimes. And also now when we're adding softness to this. I'm just going to invert this window because I want the contrast pop to affect the outside, not the inside. So if I click here, that will invert that. So it's now only affecting the steps and the railings and the softness is a finer line than the actual shape that you've drawn. So you can differentiate between the two a little bit easier than you used to be able to. Okay, so this next feature is a new way of marking clips. If I click on this shot here, if we just play that through, what you see is we have a big camera move and that needs a little bit of work in the grade. I need to do a bit of key framing there to change the grade from here to here. You see this is a little bit soft here. So I'd like to add a bit more contrast into there, but I don't want to do it right now. So what I'm going to do is mark the shot up. So I'm just going to literally mark in, press I on my keyboard and go to the end of the shot and I'm going to press O for mark out. So I've now got a mark in and a mark out range. Now what I'm going to do is go up here to mark and say convert in and out to duration marker. And what that does is convert that in and out point to a marker. So if I get rid of my in and out point, which is alt X and you see that I'm left with a dynamic marker. So this is a marker with a duration and I can rename this now. So let's call it dynamic key frame and then I can search for that at the end of the job. And just before we look at the last thing, I know I keep doing this every week, but my channel has literally doubled this week. I can't thank you all enough. Again, I got nearly 4,000 subscribers this week. I'm just about at 8,000 now. So once again, thank you so much and let's go on with the rest of this episode. Now the last thing I want to show you is in the scopes. And if you're new to the scopes, it'd be worth having a look at my dedicated episode explaining exactly how they work. Now if I click here, we can expand the scopes out. So we're currently looking at a 2 by 2 display. You can change this now to be 3 by 3. This is a new feature. So we've now got nine windows in here. This is a floating window. So this can actually go onto a second monitor. And I believe it can actually go into a third monitor. So if you're running a three monitor setup, you can actually have this on a dedicated third monitor now. What we can do here is make any of these scopes anything you want. So that could be a waveform and you could change the settings to be different from this one. But down here, you've got a vectorscope. And inside the vectorscope is a really useful tool where here you can measure just the saturation in the low. So in the sort of shadows or the mids or the highlights. But it's a switch. So you have to switch between the three. So what's good now is you could have three vectorscopes with the first one set to be the low range and the second one set to be the mids and the third one can be the high. So you're looking at the highlights. So I'm now looking at saturation in the shadows, saturation in the mid tones and saturation in the highlights. So this is a really useful tool to have open. And then with this vectorscope, we could leave it set to all and maybe put the skin tone indicator on there. So we've now got four vectorscopes. Obviously it's quite large. So I do recommend you have this on a second or third screen. So I hope you've enjoyed this episode looking at some of the more subtle things that are in Resolve 17. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
