## Transcript
So, I just want to quickly tell you about a really exciting event that's happening on June the 26th at 4pm Pacific Time. That is eight notes, no, that's midnight my time in the UK. And it's called Learn With Masters. It's been organised by TAC Resolve Training and it's a charity event to raise money for the COVID relief effort in India. Those guys at TAC Resolve Training have been running around delivering aid where it's needed. They're doing a fantastic job and this is to raise money. All the proceeds are going to go to that charity. Walter's going to speak to you in a minute and tell you who the lineup is. He's basically gone around and gathered 12 of the world's leading colourists, well 11 of the world's leading colourists and me. And we're going to talk about our insights and what we do and I can tell you that two of those on that panel are actually my favourite colourists. So I'm really excited about this event. Can't wait to hear what they have to say. I'm not going to tell you which ones they are. And I'm going to be talking personally about my workflows and how I keep things efficient but also about balancing shots. So I'm going to give you some tips and tricks and techniques for balancing your shots. And basically look after yourselves, get your tickets now and I'll hopefully see you there on June 26th.
