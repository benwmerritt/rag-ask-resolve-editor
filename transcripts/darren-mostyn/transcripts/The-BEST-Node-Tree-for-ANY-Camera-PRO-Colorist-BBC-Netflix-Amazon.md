So, I get a lot of requests of people wanting me to show them how to grade particular camera profiles and what I want to do in this episode is show you a slightly broken down version of my fixed broadcast notary that I use on every single job. That's for BBC, Amazon, ITV, branded content, whatever it is. I use the same fixed notary. I'm going to show you exactly how to build it and show you how easy it is to grade any camera profile. So, to show you those examples I've got here, this is Canon Log 3. I've got Canon with not logs, it's just Canon Wide Gamut. I've got Sony S-Log 3. I've got, this is red. I've got Blackmagic Design Raw, Arri and even iPhone footage. And if your camera profile is not in this list, I promise you that this fixed notary will work for any camera profile. So, it's going to be a really great way of moving forward. Also, I'm going to show you good solid techniques that I used on my day-to-day broadcast grading that will give you consistently good color grading results. So, stick with this one. So, I've got my first shot here. This is Canon Log 3. So, what I want to do is go to my color management settings and just have a look at what's going on. And these are currently set to the default. Now, I'm not going to work in the automatic color management. We're going to use color space transforms. And I've got quite a few episodes on that. I'll put links to those in the description. But basically, if you follow what I'm doing here and I will put this actual notary when it's finished in the description in a link and you'll be able to download it. But I'm going to show you how to build it from scratch. So, our timeline color space, as you know, wants to be a larger color space. That allows us to take any camera profile and have it comfortably working in a larger color space. So, the one I use, you can use Aces, you can use Arri, you can use whatever you actually prefer. But I work in DaVinci Wide Gamma Intermediate. This is a really good starting point for me. And my output color space, as we all know, needs to match my display, which is currently calibrated to Rec799 Gamma 2.4. That is what my delivery is. So, that's what my monitor is calibrated to. And that's the only output color space that's worth putting in there if you're using a Gamma 2.4 monitor. All right, let's press save to that. I could actually save that as a profile, by the way, so you can have it as a default. And I'm going to press save. The first part of building our fixed notary is to get our color space transformed because we do want to work color managed. But we want to do it manually, not automatically. And this is the key to be able to switch between these different camera profiles really easily. So node number one here, we're going to build it from scratch. There's absolutely nothing going on here so far. And I'm just going to go to my effects. And I've got these filtered actually by favorites. So normally you'd have it on show. All you'd see all your effects. But I've got my favorite showing. These are the ones that I use most of the time. I'm going to take my color space transform here. And what we're trying to build up here is the perfect notary that we can save and apply it to every single job that we use moving forward forever. And you'll slowly start adapting it. But let's just build that notary. Node number one is going to take our camera color space into a unified color space that all our clips are going to work in. And that will be DaVinci wide gamut in this instance. So our output color space here DaVinci wide gamut. And our output gamut is DaVinci intermediate. Keep all these as default for now. I'm going to show you why in a moment. And our input color space is the camera source itself. So the camera color space in this case that is Canon. It is C log three. I'm going to show you what to do if you don't know what that color space is as well. So Canon log three. There we go. So this still looks wrong. That's because we've sent it to DaVinci wide gamut. My monitor doesn't display DaVinci wide gamut. It displays Rick 709 gamma 2.4. So this is still no good for me. So what I want to be able to do before I start grading is see in the correct color space. I want to see my display color space, not the camera color space. Let's put another CST. I'm going to press option S to add a serial. And I'm going to move this over here because this is actually going to be right near the very end of our no tree. And it's like another color space transform. And we've currently sent Canon up to DaVinci wide gamut. At the end, I want to come from DaVinci wide gamut. And DaVinci intermediate. And our output color space is Rick 709 gamma 2.4. And this, by switching this on now, this is going to look correct. This will look what that camera was seeing when they filmed this on that rooftop. 2.4. There we go. So that looks much better starting point for me now. So this node here will always be and will never change. I'm just going to label it now. It will be DaVinci wide gamut 2709. So I'm going to grade underneath it so I can see correctly what the camera was seeing. I want to see in display space, not in the camera color space. This node, number one, is the one that will change depending on what flavor we're working with down here. And all we're going to change is the input color space. So let's build the node tree first and then I'll apply it to those other shots and show you just how quick and easy it is to get good consistent results with your color grading using this fixed node tree. Okay. And this is based on my actual broadcast node tree that I used day to day. Let me just show you something because people ask me, what should this OOTF? What is all this stuff? What are we doing with this? Basically, DaVinci Resolve knows what it's doing with these settings. So it's going to apply the correct transform function. These are transform functions. Depending on whether it's a camera color space or a display color space or a working larger color space. All right. So we've got our DaVinci wide gamut. We've got our Canon log three. These are both large color spaces. So the correct check boxes have been applied automatically. If we look at our last one, this is going from a large working color space DaVinci wide gamut to a display color space. So automatically Resolve has ticked the correct boxes. If I just temporarily swap these around, so we're going to go from a display space to a large color space, watch what happens. The tick boxes move automatically. So basically you can trust what DaVinci Resolve is doing with those tick boxes. All right. So just trust it. It works. What we need to do now is build the node structure, which I'm going to build the nodes first and then I'm going to go in and fill them in and start doing an actual grade for you on these shots. So I'm going to press option S, which is going to give me a serial. And I'm going to call this balance and exposure. Okay. So sometimes I have this on two nodes, but just for this, I'm going to put it all on one node. I'm not going to actually do it yet. I'm going to build the node tree first. So let's add another one. This next one is going to be my contrast and I could build another one. And this one is going to be saturation. So when I get to this point here, I would have got myself in a really good starting point. And what I want to do then is build the node structure. There's going to be my fine adjustments. So things like temperature, adjusting highlights, doing anything with the warp at all curves, that kind of thing. And what these are going to do is come from parallels and I'll explain why. So I'm going to add a serial first and then I'm going to add some parallels. I'm pressing option P. Let's just do four for now. You can have this as big as you want, but these are basically going to be my sort of fine tuning nodes. Okay. This is fine tuning the look that we've got when we get to this point here. But we're always grading under this CST and you'll always be grading under any film looks that you've got going on, which I'm going to do in a moment. So let's label up these some examples. So this could be, for example, temperature. This one here might be HDR. It might be highlights in the HDR tool, for example. This one here, for example, might be anything I do with the warper. And this one here is curves. And you can have as many of these as you like. So if you use lots of different curves, you might want to split those up into extra parallel nodes. But the point of this is that when we've graded up to here, we've got a really good solid foundation and we then split off. So this one will go and feed our temperature. But when I do my highlight work here, I want it to come from this here, not from what I've done with the temperature. When I do my warper, I want it to come from this point here, to come down here, because this is a really good solid grade up to this point here. So this one feeds, this one feeds, this one. And then we're feeding off into these various branches. This gives us a really good solid consistent grade. This is kind of one of the secrets to my grading being very consistent. The next thing I'm going to do is add another serial after this. I'm going to call this one, I'm going to run out of room a minute, but I'm going to call this one trim. And what this is, it's just an extra node on the end that allows me to fine tune all of these grades that are going on here. This is all working in Da Vinci wide gamut, remember. All these little tweaks that I've done here, I can then do an overall little tweak in here. That might just be an extra little bit of contrast. It might be just lifting shadows. It could be anything like that. So that's just there. I remember you don't have to use the node just because it's there. The idea of the fixed node tree is this is a reminder for me to grade in a good methodical order to get good consistent results. The next thing I'm going to do is add another serial. And then I'm going to make a parallel off that. And you might want two or three parallels here, but these are basically going to be my power windows. So any work that I'm doing where I'm isolating an area are going to happen in this little parallel node tree here. So I'm going to call this one power window one. I'm going to call this one here power window two. And I'm going to call this one here power window three. All right, I'm going to run out of room here. So let me just close down my gallery for a second and move that over. So you can see what's going on. That's our end node tree. And then what I want is another probably one, maybe two more serials here. And these are going to be things like my grain or textures and things like that. So let's just put in here. Let's call it texture. The next thing I need to add in here is any particular looks that you might be doing because what you're going to do is grade underneath those looks. So the classic one is the Kodak 2383 film look that's built into DaVinci Resolve. As you know from my episode, again, I put a link to it in the description on how to correctly build these film looks, but they need to be working in a different gamma than 709. So let me show you that. And again, I've done a whole episode on this. So check that episode out if you're unsure what I'm doing here. But what you need to do is add another serial here. And I'll do another serial as well. And let's just apply the film look. So let's take any one of these built in, but this one, Kodak 2383 is a very popular one. I'm going to drag and drop that on. And as you can see, the image goes a little bit too strong. Okay, it's not that good. And as explained in that episode, it's because the input into here needs to be a different color space than what's currently feeding it. And what's currently feeding it is this. I think that's where our effects here. Rec 79 gamma 2.4. That's wrong. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to stick onto this node, another color space transform. Now I can't actually see that node to apply it. So what you do, middle mouse click, I'm using a pen, but it's the same thing. You just middle click and you can drag this around then. So now I can see the node, drag a color space transform on it and only do this if you're going to use this Kodak film LUT or any one of these LUTs. You've got a Fuji film LUT, but they're expecting Cineon film log, not gamma 2.4. So what you need to do is say, Rec 79 up here. This is as quick as I can. And it is the input is gamma 2.4 because that's what we've fed it. And the output color space here is going to be still Rec 709, but in a different gamma, which is Cineon film log. Now that Kodak film emulation looks a lot more usable. And what's covered in that video is the fact that I highlight these together, right click and create what's called a compound node. So this is two nodes inside that node. And what that allows me to do is adjust the strength using this key button here. Basically using this key output tool, I can adjust the strength. So at zero, that's effectively not applied. And at 100, you're at full strength. I'm going to call that Kodak. If you wanted to use a different one, of course, what you can do is right hand click on here. You can say show compound node. And then all you've got to do is right click here and you can change that LUT to be any one of the other ones. Okay, you just simply switch and then click on here and you're back out. So we've now got the foundation of a good solid node tree. This is a slightly simplified version of my advanced one that I covered in my master classes. But this is a great node tree to be working with, to work with any camera color space that you've got going on. All right, this will give you a good disciplined solid grade workflow. So I'll probably save this at this point here. Okay. And I'm going to save it with this disabled. That way it's not applied unless I switch it on. So I'm going to go to my gallery here and I'm going to right click on here and I'm going to say grab still. So what we've got basically is a empty node tree, but with our CSTs ready to go. And I'm going to show you how I would actually go about grading this now. So we've got the correct input color space. I'm going to switch my film print emulation on. Okay, so this is if I want to work with a bit of a look and I would grade underneath this look because as you can see my scopes have already changed what they're doing. Let's just switch that off. So because I've got this going on, if I'm going to work underneath it, I need it on all the time because it's affecting my overall look. And then I'm going to grade underneath this. So we're going to grade underneath these two effectively. I'm going to dial it back a little bit because it's a bit strong. So let's just do, let's say, half mix of that, something like that. And now I'm going to start balancing. So we go to our first node, which is balance and exposure. So to do that, I'm going to keep the scopes open so you can see what's going on. But I'd probably go to the HDR tool, have a look at our exposure. Let's just bring that down a little bit, something like that. I would be looking at our balance. So let's see what's going on here. It's actually really nicely balanced, but let's see what happens in our primaries if I go to my offset tool. And you can grade this however you want now, obviously, but I'm just trying to get a really good starting point. There we go, something like that. All right, the next thing I'm going to do is apply contrast. Several different ways you can apply contrast. I'm going to just do it quickly here, just adding the basic contrast tool, or you could even go into the HDR wheel and add contrast down here. OK, many, many different ways of doing it. So I prefer to work in the primaries with my contrast. I'm just going to increase contrast here a little bit. Like I said, there's many, many different ways of doing it, but I'm not going to cover that in this particular episode. Let's go to our saturation. Does it need any saturation? It's actually looking pretty saturated to me, but let's just add a little bit anyway. That's why HDR tool for that. Add a little bit of saturation in. And we should have here now a really good starting point, which I think we have at this point here, if this should look good, and if it doesn't look good, you shouldn't move forward. This is the point at where you want this good, because what we're going to do now is branch off into these different nodes and make our fine tune adjustments. So for example, top one here, temperature. Let's just go to our kind of temperature. I like to do this in HDR tool. Let's just have a look at what's going on there, something like that. And then if I go and make change, let's say I want to use the warper here. Okay. I might want to make a change to the hue on address. I can go to the warper, but I don't want it to be affected by what I just did on the temperature. I want to take the feed from here, from this saturation point. So we've got balance exposure, contrast, saturation is feeding the warper directly. So I'm going to get the best possible outcome that I can. So I could go in here now, maybe do, I don't know, you might want to do hue versus saturation. And yeah, let's just make sure that's wide and that's wide. And there is, so just desaturating a little bit of her dress there. And that is a good example. The trim here would be any adjustments I want to make to the overall look that I've done so far. So I might want to just lift up, maybe I just want to lift up the shadows a little bit so we could do that here with lift, something like that. All right. So this is where I'd make shapes and windows. If I want to start isolating anyone in there, I would do that on these nodes here to create some power windows. So let's just have a quick look at that for an example. Something like that. And then we can again increase our, maybe increase our gain a little bit and our offset, something like that. I'm going to switch that on and off just to see if it's looking better, which it is. And I don't want to do anything on these. These are just going to stay there as empty nodes. So we've done it. We've got a really good look going on there. And I've just followed this methodical workflow. So let's do this now on another image. So I'm going to take this one here. This is Canon, but Canon wide gamut. So it's not log. The fact it's not log means we don't use one of the log profiles. Okay. I'm going to go to my gallery and I take our fixed node tree. I'm going to right click and say apply. And this looks wrong. And why does it look wrong? Because it's currently set to Canon C log three. So we're going to change that. The only thing we have to change is this. All these nodes are empty. There's no balancing going on and our Kodak LUT is off. I'm going to leave that off. So we're going to, you don't always have to have it on. So I'm going to go to my effects with this node active. And we're going to put in here the correct color space. Now, because it's not log, we actually want to set this to be rec 709. Okay. So what it's actually expecting is it to be rec 709, but slightly wider profile. So I'm not going to get to gamma 2.4. I'm going to press rec 709. Okay. And now it looks a lot better, but it's a little bit flat. And the idea of this profile is that you do add a bit of contrast and saturation to it yourself to taste. Okay. So we're going to go to our balancing exposure. I'm doing this all underneath the 709 node. So my display looks correct. And we're going to balance exposure. So bring up our graph here. Let's see what's going on. So I'm going to go to my HDR exposure tool. Let's just boost this up a little bit, I think. And I'm going to go back to my primaries. Let's bring our shadows down because they've lifted a bit. Bring our game back up. Okay. I could be doing that as contrast as well. Okay. So it's a very similar tool. Bring our contrast up like so and go on to our saturation. Let's see if it needs any more saturation. Again, I'm going to do that in the HDR tool. So it's global saturations here. So I'm used to doing this on the panel. That's why I'm moving around a little bit. And we've got a bit of a cast going on here. So I'm going to go back to my balance tool. There's no reason why you can't just keep moving between these. Okay. You don't have to move linearly forward because as I make a changes here, this affects this one and this one. So I'm going to go here. I'm going to go to my primaries here and I'm just going to adjust my offset a little bit. Something like that. Now I need to add a little bit more saturation. So this is kind of how I'm working. Let's add a bit of HDR saturation. And there we go. Something like that. So that's looking good. And I didn't use the Kodak film print emulation on this. I wanted this to just be a clean look. So I'm just going to leave that switched off. I can then go in here and do the temperature and all the other adjustments. But you can see how I've got a really good start straight away. Again, let's go to this one. Let's go to the Sony one. I'm going to drag and drop my fixed no tree. Again, it's going to be wrong to start with because we've currently got it set to Canon Z log three. What I'm going to do is if I right hand click in here, I can say clean up node graph. Okay. And then we've got now my node graph. Nice and clean. Click on here. Go to my effects and let's change this to be the correct camera color space, which is your Sony S log three and it's Sony cinema gamut three. That okay. So now we've got our really good starting point. And now we go ahead, balance exposure, contrast saturation as we did before. By using the fixed no tree, you'll stay disciplined and you can switch between your different camera profiles really easily. So let's just have a quick look at these. I'm going to go and drop this on. All I've got to do on here is say, in fact, what I'm going to do. Let's click on this node graph. Let's do this properly. If I take this one and set it to a blank. So I'm going to just say use timeline, use timeline. That way it won't come in in the incorrect camera space. It will come in with no camera space. So I'm going to right and click and save that. This will be our new fixed no tree moving forward. This is the one that I'll save as a link in the description. And basically when we apply this, the first thing you have to do is apply the camera profile. So in this case, this is red. Let's go to red wide gamut at red lock 3g 10. And now we've got our great starting point because we've got the CST already applied under here. All right. So we've got the CST bringing us from DaVinci wide gamut back to 709 2.4. Now we can just start grading. So it's really quick and easy. Okay. Same with this one. Let's use our new default one. All we've got to do is change what's on node number one. And go in here and just show you how easy it is to change all these camera profiles ready to start grading. This is, oh, I always forget which one this is. Pocket 4k film 4. And again, pocket 4k film, Jim, 4. There's our great starting point. Ready to start grading. Let's get again to this one. Now another one. Go through here. Let's go to Ari wide gamut 3 and Ari lock C3. There we go. Brilliant. And now what do we do with the iPhone footage? I've done that again. I've done another episode fully explaining this. But if we click on this one, let's take our blank. Our blank tree and all we're going to do on this one is convert it into Rex 7 and 9. So our profile, our camera profile. I can't quite see that. Let's clean up here. Yeah. There we go is Rex 7 and 9 because that's what it was shot in. If you're working on the new iPhone 15s, you might find this is rec 20 20 and you want to be working in HDR. But this one shot on an iPhone 14, Rex 7 and 9 and Rex 7 and 9. Don't put gamma 2.4 because it's not got a gamma. It's Rex 7 and 9. So the gamma 2.4 is a display gamma. Okay. It's not a source camera source gamma. So we've got the 7 and 9 gamma 2.4 identified on this node here and we're ready to start grading. So that shows you how quick and easy it is to apply this fixed node tree. This is the only no tree you're going to need. It's absolutely brilliant. I'll put a link to it. Use it and then elaborate on it. If you find you need more serials on the end, add those serials and then save it as your own. Now, if you want to see how I apply that to drone footage, have a look at this video that's appearing here and there's also a tip in there on how to correct auto exposure, which is a real problem sometimes with drone footage. You get that auto exposure. So it's a really good tip in that video. Show me on that. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
