## Transcript
So just before I give you this quick tip, I want to let you know that I'm going to do it live on Tuesday, June the 1st, that's this Tuesday, 7pm, British summertime, and it's really just to say thank you for getting me to 20,000 subscribers. I'll have a little bit of a chat and a bit of banter. Let me know in the comments if there's anything particularly you want to see, but let me go and show you this quick tip now. So this is a music promo that I graded recently, and we have a title sequence going on at the beginning. So there's six main colored scenes throughout the promo, and at the beginning each one had a title, a colored title. So what it was quite useful was to be able to see the title, but I didn't want to see the clips sitting here. I just want to see the actual grade. So what you can do is instead of just shying the layer by clicking on it, obviously then the title disappears from up here, so that's no use to me, I can't actually see it. But if you just click on here, let me just put it back on, and using your option key, what happens is the title stays, but it just disappears from the actual clips in here. So it's just a nice quick tip to share with you. Look after yourselves, and hopefully see you on Tuesday.
