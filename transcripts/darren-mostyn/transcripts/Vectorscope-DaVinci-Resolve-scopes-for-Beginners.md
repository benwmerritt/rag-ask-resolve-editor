## Transcript
Hi, my name is Darren Mostyn and in this episode I'm going to revisit these scopes. So I did an episode on the scopes when I first started the channel and it's proved to be one of the more popular ones that I did. So I thought it's worth revisiting now that we're on version 17 because the scopes have changed quite a bit and this episode is going to focus particularly on getting the best out of the vectorscope. Now just to warn you the first couple of minutes also are for absolute beginners. So I'll do a real beginner's guide to what a vectorscope is. So I'll put some timestamps in the description and you can forward that bit if it's not relevant to you. So let's go and take a look. So just before we go and take a look at the vectorscope I just want to clarify that the gray scale we've got here represented on our waveform is showing our brightness level so it's luminance. Now if we go on to the vectorscope all the vectorscope is reading is saturation and hue so it's looking for color it's saturation and hue only. So the gray scale doesn't matter how bright it is it's not represented at all on this vectorscope it's just seen as a dot in the middle because the very middle of the vectorscope is zero saturation so it's got no color at all. So the further out we go in the vectorscope the more saturation we're seeing and hue is going around the outside. So let me show you if I put some color into this gray scale let me push it towards magenta you'll see that our vectorscope is now increasing in saturation and hue and pushing us towards this box here which is represented by magenta. So we've got red magenta, blue, cyan, green and yellow so these are represented around the outside. So let's have a look at a color bar. So this is a standard ebu color bar so this is a broadcast color bar and the colors in here are set to 75 percent amplitude so they are 75 percent of the total output they could be and each of these boxes in here is sitting at a 75 percent value and that is quite important because in broadcast 75 percent amplitude is your broadcast legal range so you can't go outside of that for rec 709 HD broadcast so we need to be sitting inside these boxes. I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to open up this vectorscope if I press command shift and w I can actually open that out into a larger scope so it's now in its own window so this could actually be set on a separate monitor allowing me to have full screen scopes all the time which is how I work. So here we can see all the colors sitting exactly in the 75 percent mark that we've got here and if we go into our settings up here and go to vectorscope we can actually save these settings to be something else so we could set it to be 100 target. Now if I go to 100 targets in fact what I'm going to do is put on 75 percent and 100 targets so our ebu bars sit safely inside 75 percent now if I move on to these bars these are simpty bars so they're slightly different in the fact that they have four 100 amplitude boxes so you can see these red blue cyan and yellow sitting in these 100 marks and all the other ones are sitting comfortably in the 75 percent bars. So these four outside ones are illegal for rec 709 broadcast so just to show you there are other ways of displaying this as well you don't have to have just this view you can change the view so if I go in here this is standard view you can go to a simplified view or you can go to this one which is quite interesting which is the hue vectors view so these colored lines on the end are appearing because we have 100 view on so if I take that off and go back to 75 percent you see that we've got our red magenta blue etc and the line here the little cross line here is our 75 percent point so this is quite an interesting scope but I do prefer to work with this standard one. Also down here you can take off the labels if you want so let's move on to an image and analyze it in the scope I'm just going to finish off this menu so we've also got in here the ability to display qualifier focus and what that does is allow me to if I just select a qualifier it allows me to just go around my image and I can see it represented on the vectorscope by that circle so you can see here if I go to the blacks obviously it's going to be central and if I go to this warmer area it's pointing up more towards the red and yellow on the scope so that's quite a useful tool and also in here we've got the ability to enable a low pass filter which basically takes out any signal noise that there might be that's not recognized on the scope and finally down here we've got the quality so we can choose a low medium or high quality trace and that will just update on a scope if you've got a lower powered computer you might want to just leave that onto auto as it does rely on gpu power so what's happening here on the trace on the scope all it's showing the image is not actually sitting centrally on the scope so that would indicate that it's not neutral in balance and we can see on the image here it's biasing towards the sort of red and yellows on the scope and that's because the image is quite clearly very warm now that doesn't mean it's wrong but let's just see what happens if I move offset and try and neutralize this so I'm just going to bring it over and get the image a bit more central in the scope and we can see whilst the trace looks nice and neutral it's actually not doing us any favor on that image so that's really just to point out that the image doesn't have to be sitting centrally in here so let's open up the main vectorscope menu at the moment we're set to all which means we're looking at the low saturation range mid saturation and high saturation these are all combined here and we have the ability to just look at the lowest saturated parts the higher saturated parts and the mid saturation so I'm going to leave that on all for now and looking at our image here what I want to do is just check that there is nothing not being picked up by the scope and to do that if I press extents what it does is it shows us areas that are not being picked up by the trace so we can see here that we're actually got a slight bit going outside of legal so there's a little point here that's not being picked up by the regular trace so in order to see what that is if I go to my saturation tool here what I can do is put on my highlight so what I'm doing is I'm selecting saturation from low saturation and bringing it up to high saturation and quite quickly we can see what's being picked up and it's just that bit of her watch this is obviously showing here because that's the gray background in here but this is this tiny little bit here so let me just reset that saturation so if I just take that down for a sec let's just reset that command shift w so I could probably clean that up using a little bit of desaturation or using my highlights but I'm going to leave it there for now because I just want to make some adjustments so what we're going to do is use the vectorscope to our advantage and I'm going to switch into low mode so this is just looking at the lower areas of saturation it's my more my blacks and what I'm going to do is try and centralize this try and neutralize those blacks so at the minute we're slightly off center I'm just going to come to my lift tool which adjusts my blacks I'm just going to bring that down slightly so it's a bit more neutral so those blacks are looking better already just with that simple move so let's do the same with our highs I'm going to switch onto high mode and I'm going to see if naturally if that helps that legal range so we're slightly warm again so I'm going to go to my gain I'm just going to call it off and it's only affecting the high regions so there that's now sitting more centrally on my scope and I'm just going to switch that node on and off using command D and there so what we've done is neutralized the highlights and the shadows but kept our mid-range now I'm just going to put my gain back a little bit I think that's just going a little bit too cool now what you can do on the scope here because we've only got a very small area showing for our highlights is you can click in here and you can say show two time zoom and what that does is just magnify the trace so we can see clearer what's going on so I'm just going to move that a little bit more see if I can get that literally sitting exactly central and you can see that's clearing up the whites in the clouds so I'm going to put my extents back on obviously I've got to take the two time zoom off so we can see now that we are actually naturally legal again so just by adjusting that amount in the gain we've brought that bit of saturation back into legal range so let's take these things back off you can adjust obviously the amount of scope that you've got here and the brightness of the graphical and we can also adjust the low range and high range so what is determined here where is your low point and where's your high point I'm quite happy with it sat where it is so I'm going to put that back to all and I mean in fact I can actually make this image bigger let's get rid of the clips and let's get rid of the gallery I should have done that to start with really and I just want to show you finally on here we've got the skin tone indicator so this is the line that we use as a guide for the skin tone and it is just a guide and to show you how that works if I just sample some skin using the qualifier there we can see that but it's actually picking up other stuff there so what I can do is just draw a little window oh there we go and that's just isolated skin you can see it's just slightly off so I could pull a key on that skin tone now and just make those adjustments but I'm not going to do that in this episode what I want to do is show you how I can set these scopes up to be a little bit more useful so just before we finish this episode if you've got anything out of it or you've enjoyed it hit the like button for me hit the subscription look after yourself and let's go and take a look at the rest so I'm going to bring the scopes back up and up here you've got these different views we've got two view you've got a four view and you've now with version 17 you've got nine views you can actually view nine different scopes so we could have parade history and waveform but what I want to do is adjust the vectorscope so that we're seeing more than just one vectorscope so I'm just going to four view just for this exercise normally I would have these on or I'd recommend you have these on as nine view on a completely separate monitor if you can afford to do that so I'm going to change all of these to be vectorscopes and what I'm going to do is change each one individually to show me a different region so I'm going to have this one showing me my lows and what I'm also going to do is put a two time zoom on that I don't want the skin tone indicator on the lows I'm going to put a two time zoom we're zooming in to the desaturated areas i.e the blacks okay I'm going to move over to this one and I'm going to make this high again put the two times indicator on there's no point in having the extents on if you're in two time zoom because obviously the 75% safe pots are not moving so down here I might just brighten up when I put a little bit so down here this one is going to be my mids and I'm not going to zoom that one in that's fine like that I'm going to take the skin I might leave the skin tone indicator on that but I really want the skin tone indicator on the all one so I'm going to put the skin tone indicator on this one's on all and this one stays not at two times so I can see what's going on so I can now see my shadows my highlights mid tones and overall view with the skin tone line on there so this allows you to do really quick neutralization of the blacks getting neutral whites and just looking at your overall saturation and hue levels but checking that they're legal at the same time
