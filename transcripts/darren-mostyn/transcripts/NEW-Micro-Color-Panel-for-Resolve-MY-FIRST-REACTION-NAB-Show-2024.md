So I'm just about to see the new Da Vinci Resolve Micro panel. I've not actually touched it yet. I have just seen it, but this is the first time I'm ever going to touch it. So you're going to see first hand what it's like. Okay, cool. Dig in. Let me touch it. So here we go. So it looks nice. Let's see what it weighs. Yes. I don't know what that is. It's actually pretty light. It's like, again, if you design you can chuck it in a rucksack. So it's definitely not as heavy as it used to be. If you go for the micro, you want portability, don't you? Well, this whole thing, this one is designed to be portable. So if you're throwing it in a rucksack, you don't want something too heavy. Alright, so backlit. Yes. That's good. Which is nice. Yeah. Helps my eyesight. Looks nice. More buttons. More buttons. I presume that's a good thing. That is a good thing. We always want more buttons. And, somewhere to keep your pen and pencil. Yeah, somewhere to keep your pen and pencil. Absolutely. Obviously, iPad slot around the back. Yeah. Because it connects via Bluetooth as well as USB-C. So if you want to be truly mobile, you know, we've got guys kind of doing social media, for example, you're going to do a grade in the field and upload it straight away. Yeah. iPad in the back, Bluetooth in, away you go. Yeah. So I would be having that iPad here. Yeah. I'd have my scopes on there. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so take, yeah, color page. Color page. We've got an interface. And if you're in a studio with this, not in the field, you could put an iPad there and have your scopes over it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Just a thought. Yeah, stop. Right. I want to press a button. Okay, go for it. Press. Oh, no, actually, you know what? I'm going to start off with the, with the track balls. Yes. The traditional way. So let's see. So I'm going to add a zero. There you go. Add no. I don't know. Okay, they feel nice. Yeah. Feels a bit different. Actually, they've got a really nice tactile feel, but it's nice. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They do. Because I kind of like the rubber buttons. It's got nice satisfying clicks. Yeah, yeah. But I like the satisfying click, though. Yeah, me too. It's like the keyboards. Yeah. Okay, so lift game again. Okay. Ah, they feel, they feel really nice, actually. They've got a nice little bit of resistance in there. Yeah. Actually, that's really nice. So what I don't like is you reach for a button here and you just knock it accidentally. Yeah, yeah. And it flies. So that's good. Okay. You know, they've been engineered again with Colrest in mind for that exact thing. You want a bit of, want it to be tactile. Yeah. You don't want them. So they're definitely smaller. Yes, they're, yeah. But I don't feel too compromised. No. Yeah. I've actually been on it 30 seconds. Don't let the size deceases. See what it's like after a full day on it. Yeah, no, very nice. Okay, so let's have a look at the rings then. Okay, so again, yeah, they've got a nice little bit of resistance. Yeah, yeah. But it doesn't, I don't know what it's made out of, but it doesn't, it doesn't feel cheap. No, I mean, I dare I say, for me, none of our products feel cheap. There's always that solidity about them, that feeling that they're well put together. Yeah. Okay. All right, so let's have a look at, so the traditional 12 buttons are identical to what they were before. Yes. But the buttons changed. It's not, they used to be a bit taller. So let me see what these feel like. So if I go for contrast and pivot, so I'd normally work these together. Together, yeah. Okay, what's nice about that straight away, oh, that's really nice actually. Yes. In fact, let me test that on saturation. If I'm adjusting saturation, I don't want to turn a little bit and this goes off the charts. Yes. So that's really nice actually. So configurable in user preferences, in terms of sensitivity. Yes, you can, the balls are again, like with all our panels, you can configure the sensitivity. Okay, cool. All right, that's really nice. So reset, I don't, yeah. Very good. So they're definitely, yeah, these feel nice. I like. So obviously, I think the main thing with the keys is this shift up, shift down. Yes. So we're getting added functionality. What's that? Yeah. Times three. Yes. So that's what it is. Yeah. Another one. Down another one. Yeah. So I guess you've just got to learn that. Yes. There will obviously be a user manual coming for it. But yeah, there's a number of functions on there when you do shift up, shift down. So I presume that might be things like if I add a window. Yeah. I'm guessing I can shift up and that can make one of these, can adjust my window is what I'd like it to. Yes. Oh, there you go. Oh, so that's zooming. There you go. So you can adjust the windows, which is really cool. That's pretty intuitive. And that's rotation. Yeah, there you go. And I really like that. Oh, so that's adjusting the actual pitch. Do you know what I'd be doing? If I first got this, I'd just be sitting there, shift up and then just press everything and see what happens. Yeah. Shift down. And you'll get used to the ones that you want to use. Yeah, yeah. I really like it. I love it. So I presume you've not got an iPad here because you're NAB and you'll get through about 400 iPads. No, no, we do. We do have an iPad somewhere down there. Oh, OK. If you would like to see it working with an iPad. I'd like to see how sort of stable it is with an iPad in it. Yeah. But I definitely have my iPad. If I was using this, I'd definitely have it. I'm thinking about some print scopes on it. Yeah. Brilliant. I love it. Good, I'm glad. Well, for the first five minutes, I appreciate you letting me have a... That's all right. You know, I'll be a little play on it. Thanks for coming to see us. That's all right. It was good to see you mate. My pleasure. Thanks a lot. Take care. Cheers. Enjoy your NAB. I know it's exhausting these things. Yeah, I've been here a while already. You'll be good. All right, thanks mate. No worries. Cheers.
