## Transcript
So, in this episode we're going to be looking at Halation and I'm going to show you how to set it up properly, how to use it in DaVinci Resolve and I'm going to show you two different ways. I'm going to show you using the Halation tool itself, which was the new plugin that came with version 17.4 and I'm also going to show you a third party plugin called DeHance, which has a really good Halation section built into it. It's a film emulation plugin. So I'm going to take a look at both of those and first of all, let me just quickly explain to you what Halation is. There's plenty of YouTube videos out there that explain it in more detail, but it's basically, if you look at this image here, you can see that it's basically a visual effect that appears on film. So we're trying to recreate it here digitally, but it's basically when the light bounces back off the anti-halation layer when it enters the camera and you get this red sort of orange halo in areas of high contrast. So and often you'll get a bit of a red glare on mid-tones, so maybe skin tones and things like that. So we're looking in bright light sources. So I've really been playing with both of these Halation tools quite extensively and to find out which one I prefer, you can have to wait till later in this episode. So let's go and take a look at how it works and how to set it up, but before that, I just want to explain that Halation is a very subtle tool. The art of getting Halation looking good is incredibly subtle. So it's quite hard to show that on YouTube. So what I'm going to do is slightly exaggerate all the movements to start with and then at the end I will show you a proper before and after with a few more subtle settings. So let's go and take a look. So I've got a series of clips on my timeline ready to start grading. In fact, I've already started some work on these. So this shot here, really nice shot for applying Halation because we've got lots of nice highlights everywhere and it's good clean footage. And this footage has come from Artgrid. So they're not sponsoring this video just for clarity, but there are some affiliate links in the description. So if you click on those, you can get two months free subscription to Artlist and Artgrid. And it's basically a stock footage site, stock video footage site. It does music as well. But what I like is you can access the log file so it's not necessarily graded footage. So let me just show you. I'm going to reset this. So here's our clip of this guy eating his breakfast. And what we're going to do is have a look at the color management settings. So down here in my color management, you'll see that I'm in DaVinci YRGB and I'm in Rec 79 Gamma 2.4. So I'm not using effectively a color managed workflow. My color managed workflow comes from using CST. So I've used in the past in previous videos, my fixed node tree, and I have a color space transform set somewhere around the middle, which can take me from whichever camera space I'm in into my display space, which in this case is Rec 79 Gamma 2.4. If you don't understand color management, don't worry about it at all. Basically what you need to do is forget the CSTs, forget the color management side of it. You just need to get this first node looking much better balanced than this. So I suggest you have a look at probably offset and maybe lift and gain and probably whack a bit of saturation in there. And you'd be good to go certainly for the purpose of this exercise to get you working with halation. However, if you do understand color space transforms, then I'm going to reset that single node. We've got absolutely nothing going on here at all. I'm going to add two more nodes at the beginning. And my third node there is going to be for my color space transform. So this is going to take me out of the red color space that we're in into my display space, which is a Rec 79 2.4. So let's just go to my effects here. And these are some of my favorites in here. So that's why this list looks a little bit shorter. And just so you know, by the way, the halation tool is studio only. You need the full version of the entry resolve in order to use it. You can use it, but it would be watermarked, obviously. So there we go. So I'm going to change my input color space, red, white, gamma RGB. And my input gamma is going to be red log 3g 10. OK, so that's got me into a really nice state to start working. And what I'm going to do on these two nodes, I would normally have many more nodes than this, but just for the episode on halation, I'm going to do my balance and exposure stuff on these first two nodes. OK, so first node here, let's go straight down to offset. I'm going to use my panel just because it's quicker and more accurate. And I prefer it. And I'm just going to just lift and gain there. I'm keeping an eye on those scopes at the same time. And we're pretty good there. Let me just check the actual clip there. So let's have his skin tone as a reference here. And on this side, we can have a look at just maybe cooling this off a little bit. So I'm just going to get to my offset and cool off just a little bit. Maybe just have a look at what kind of temperatures doing. I think it was good as it was. All right, so we've got a good starting point there ready to start our halation. Now, where are we going to put halation? Now, I've done quite a lot of research on this and halation is typically, obviously, is at the acquisition side. OK, so when you're shooting on film, it's the light is coming in and it bounces a little bit off that anti halation backing layer that you have. And that's what's causing this effect. So it's actually there to start with. So you would think really that the best place to put the halation would be right at the start, but I've been playing with this and I'm getting better results when it's after the colour space transform. In fact, I'm actually getting better results when it's right at the end of my no tree pretty much. I might do a vignette after that, possibly grain. But I'm getting really good effects right at the end. And this also keeps things like my keys clean and just I don't know. I'm just getting much better results with it at the end. So I'm going to go after my colour space transform. In fact, let's just label these up so we don't get confused. That's my colour space transform. These two are balance and exposure. Also. And I'm going to add another node after this. So just to clarify, I would normally have maybe five, six, seven, eight nodes going on here that have some window shapes going on. But this let's just get this going on the halation. Now, I'm going to show you two different types of relation. As I mentioned, the first one, we're going to use DaVinci Resolve's one built into the resolve effects. All right, this is with the studio version. So it's down here called Halation. Let's just drag and drop that on. And immediately you've got some settings coming in. OK, so if I just literally enabled and disable that. It's actually working already. You can see that happening on the scopes. And let's see if we can actually see some halation in the image already. So let's go to a better mode. I'm going to press shift and F and that takes me into a much larger screen. So you'll be able to see what's going on with the halation. And I keep my halation settings open. And in fact, what I'm going to do just to keep it clear, I can show you my no tree. Now let's just label that up just to be clear. So Halation node. And you can see by default, it's already doing something. If I just disable and enable that node, you can see here, we've got halation going on here. Let me just zoom in a little bit so you can see better. And so we've got a nice bit of halation happening just in these areas of high contrast up here, particularly. And we can clearly see that the red is being affected as well. Now the color space we're in at the top here is currently set to the timeline. So it's Rick seven and nine gamma two point four. But I can actually set this to work in a larger color space. And that's just going to give me much more scope for playing around with these tools. So let's just change that now to DaVinci wide gamut or I could change it to red settings. But I'm going to go to DaVinci wide gamut because that's about the largest color space that there is. And you see straight away that red looks a little bit better than it's just taken out a bit of the heat off that. So I'm going to keep these slightly exaggerated so that YouTube can show you what's going on just in case it compresses it too much. But basically we've got our first section here, which is isolation. Now that is determining what part of the image is going to have halation affected or not. So it's pretty straightforward. So the threshold is basically the black levels. Let me just go to a full image for you again. So the further down here we go, the more is included. Obviously we want to keep this pretty restricted. So I'm just going to go around about there. There's a little bit of pushing and pulling of all these sliders to get the optimum halation, but let's let's keep going. And the normalization is obviously going to work out our high threshold. So as we pull down from here, you'll see that our highlights become included up here. So that's not looking too great. Let's pull that back again. And the film saturation level is used for allowing us to increase the brightness through HDR. So obviously when we're moving up into six, seven hundred nits or whatever scale we're going up to, this film saturation level allows us to increase those highlights. So the next section, Dylare Reflections, is showing us how the halation is reflected. So we've got several different tools down here to work with. Strength is pretty obviously going to show us the strength of that halation. Again, I'm going to just zoom in here. Let's see if there's anything else happening actually. Let's just move to the shot. Obviously remember with moving shots, when you're working with things like halation, you really need to be playing that shot back time after time, just making sure that nothing strange is happening. OK, so I'm hoping to get a bit of halation off his glasses. And there's a little bit happening there. If I just zoom in, I'm going to zoom in and out all the time on this episode. But there, let's just take that on and off. So Gamma is really about the spread of that halation. You can see that changing there in his glasses. Saturation is the sort of intensity of the color of that, obviously. Let's just zoom that up a little bit. And if I go there and then desaturate, it goes white. So we're losing the actual color of the halo. And what spread is doing is emulating the light reflecting off the anti-halation backing and it's emulating how far through the red, green and blue elements of the film, it's actually attracting. So as I move this up, you should see that start to go cooler. Yes, it's starting to go green. Pull it back. It goes a little bit warmer again. So that's spread. So I'm going to keep that low. I'm going to keep my saturation up and bring my Gamma down because I want that really subtle in there. OK, even that's too much. I'm going to bring it back in a moment. So the secondary glow section is about bloom. So when light hits film stock, you genuinely get a little bit of blooming happening as well. So it's kind of like a glow effect. If I bring this up, you'll see that by default, everything is switched off because it's got zero bloom or secondary glow, I should call it. And as I increase that, you can see it happening here. If I move down, let's go to that this here or even his shirt here. You can see that happening a lot. I'm going to just exaggerate it so you can see what's going on. All right. So this would be super subtle in my mind. I would hardly be touching this at all if at all. So Gamma is increasing the spread of that secondary glow and spread is determining which part of the highlight is affected and the filter here. You can actually adjust this and change its color. So I'm just going to go to stream here and show you, but you can actually change the color of that effect as well. So I'm going to cancel that. Let's keep it neutral white and down here then basic grain. So the basic grain, obviously we're trying to emulate film here. So there would be some film grain element in there. So this is some of the basic grain settings from Resolve's own film grain feature. So you can append grain internally. Now you can see a nice bit of grain coming in and obviously strength, softness, saturation speak for themselves. I'm going to take that off just for now. And then down here, we've got our global adjustments so we can actually view where our halation is occurring. And again, make sure you play the footage through to check. I want to make sure I get a nice bit on his glasses. I'm just going to go back to fit. So shift Z will do that, by the way. And you can see here, we've actually got quite a lot of heavy halation going on. This is the rim of his glasses. So I'm going to take that back and now let's make it a bit more subtle. So I've shown you what the sliders do, but let's just knock it all back a little bit. So globally, I can adjust my that sort of haloing that I'm getting from the halation. Aspect ratio allows me, if you're working with anamorphics, you can actually change the aspect ratio of the shape of the halo. You're getting a little bit hard to show you in here. And detail loss is an element to, again, film emulation where you would lose a little bit of detail in the image so you can literally just show extreme. Obviously, that is extreme, but you can just pull out a little bit of the detail in there. Again, just give you that nice film emulation. So let me just have a look at what's going on in the rest of this image. OK, and this is too extreme for me. So I'm going to pull that whole thing back. Let's just take our threshold down a little bit. I just want it to be really subtle. That's quite nice there. So let's just play that clip back. Let's do it in full screen, actually. So command F, play that back. And that's looking really nice there. OK, I think it's probably still a little bit strong on his glasses here. So I'd probably knock that back a little bit. But it gives you a good insight into DaVinci Resolve's own built in halation tool. So let's have a look at the halation in DeHanser. So I've taken off the node that we just did for the DaVinci Resolve halation. I'm going to add a brand new one. And these are my favorites here. I've got DeHanser Pro 5.3.0 down here. Now, it's just been released today. I have been using DeHanser for a little while, but 5.3 came out today. So that has now got it's much better film grain in there, effectively. But I will cover DeHanser in another episode. This is just about halation. So by default, you can see when I throw it on, it actually does quite a lot. There's film grain in here. There's all sorts of stuff going on. And that is because DeHanser Pro is not just halation. So the DeHanser model is you can buy the Pro version, which has all the different film emulation things that you're going to need. So you've got film stock in there. You've got film grain. You've got weave, breathe, that sort of stuff. You can buy each of those as individual elements, including halation. So if you just wanted to halation, you can go to the DeHanser website and just buy that pack at the minute. It's $99 or you can buy DeHanser Pro, which has all of the packs in one hit. So I'm just going to use the halation element from here. And by the way, they're not sponsoring this video, but you can get a discount on any of the DeHanser plugins if you go to the checkout and type in Darren 10. So that's D A double R E N capital letters number 10. And you will get a 10 percent discount. So let's have a look at what it does. So I'm going to first of all, I'm going to take off all the extra stuff that's in here. So let's get rid of the film emulation there, the film print. Sorry, let's get rid of this expand. Let's get rid of this print. Let's get rid of the color heads. Definitely get rid of the film grain. And you see halation here is not actually on, but it will be in a minute. We've got a bloom, separate bloom area here. And we've got vignetting. These are all off now. So the gate weave is off as well. So we've only got halation applied. Now, just before I go in at the top here, you also can see that we can change our input source. So our source at the minute is rec 709. And that's because this is sitting after my CST. So I want it to be in rec 709. But you could, if you didn't use a CST, you could actually use DeHanser Pro as your color management. So you can go down here and you could choose either the camera. So I could type in my my red settings in there, or you could just choose DaVinci Wide Gamma if you prefer. So I'm going to stick on rec 709 because that is the input that this is expecting. I'm going to go to my halation down here. And by default, it's actually put a little bit of halation on as soon as I press enabled. So there we go. I saw the scope just lift up a little bit then. I'm going to disable and enable that. You can see that moving. And obviously it's moving the red highlights up, which is what I'd expect because halation is putting a sort of red a red halo around our highlighted areas. But it's also affecting on DeHanser by default a little bit of skin tone in here. So if I have a look, we still got our same balance exposure and offset that we had with the DaVinci Resolve halation. But this one is giving us a slightly different look. And if I just zoom in. Let's get a bit more 100 percent. Sorry. Let's go right in. I hope you can see this on YouTube. But if I enable and disable that. I don't think you can see it. But it is giving a slightly different look to the skin tone. And that's actually a typical property of film halation. Some of the mid tones would be affected as well. So this is actually good emulation by default. Let's switch that back on. So I tend to start with these two sliders here, local diffusion and global diffusion. Global diffusion is allowing for less than highlights to come in. So it's more creepy into your mid tones. So how much of this face do I want to be included? As I bring that up, you can see it getting more and more halation effects. So it's not the halo effect. It's a kind of red glow on the mid tone. Now, the local diffusion here is affecting the amount that you see there. So it's getting stronger. You can see it on the glasses. So it's the amount of the halo. So the more bring this down, the less of the halo effects. Now, to see the halo effects, we need to go on to a slightly different part of this image. Remember, always looking through your shot. So let's go. I want to find a bit where that sugar pop was, which is there. OK, so now if I go to the local diffusion, you can see that we get that a little bit more refined. So that's a little bit more what I'd expect from the halo effect. The source limiter is literally cutting off brighter sources. So as I bring that up, less is included. Obviously, 100 percent, there is nothing included. You're effectively not applying halation. So we can control at which point halation starts to kick in in terms of brightness levels, the background gain. What this does is halos generally appear on areas of high contrast. So you've got highlight and dark and the background gain allows me to adjust how dark the image has to be to include a halo. So as I move background gain down, only the really dark areas would be included with halation. So you can see that now the halation is almost gone. So I need to bring that back up a bit. So it's basically saying how contrasted it has to be to have a halo or halation effect in there. So smoothness is affecting the actual halo itself. And the amplifier section here is is talking about the amplification of the light, the emulation of the light hitting the anti-halation layer and feeding back through the film. So the film is obviously hitting the red layer first, the green layer second and the blue layer after that. So the more it amplifies, the more green and then the more blue you get. So let's have a look at that. So going up and down, you can see it's intensity and its color is slightly changing and you can actually change the hue here as well. So I can actually change the color of the halo. And down here, this blue compensation here is if you've got halation sitting on a cooler background, so it's more blues in the background, you can adjust. Obviously, then the halo will look a little bit more green. So you can adjust that using the blue compensator here. And impact is literally opacity of it. So how much palatial do you want or how less? So let's have a look at the whole image here. And let's just check all of it. I want to check that his glasses have got a nice little kick on them. And maybe check these up here, these highlights up here. So there it is. I'm just going to switch this on and off. And they are indeed being affected. And we've got this real nice glow in his face. And that is a very nice halation. So once you finish with the halation, you would then move on to the other elements such as bloom and film grain to get this film emulation looking just right. But this is really just about halation this episode. Obviously, the DaVinci Resolve one has a little bit of film grown built in and you've got the sort of tools that would do subtle blooming. So just be aware of that if you are looking at the answer. The answer pro includes everything. So in a moment, I'm going to play a couple of clips from the timeline with the dehancer halation and the DaVinci Resolve halation so you can see them for yourselves. These are subtle. These have been set to how I would set halation. So I do hope they come across on YouTube, but they may not. So if you've enjoyed this, please subscribe, hit the like button. I spent a long time preparing this to make sure that you got good insight into how these two fantastic tools work. I'm sure you'll agree that they are giving really good film emulation of the halation. Check out in the description, you've got two free months there with the links to Art Grid and Art List, which is where I got all this footage from. Don't forget the beauty of this is I can work with the log of the footage as well. There is 10% discount on dehancer so you can get dehancer pro or any of the individual plugins from dehancer. Darren 10 capital letters gives you 10%. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode. So I guess the question is, which one do I prefer using? Both of these tools are absolutely fantastic. The DaVinci Resolve halation, drag and drop it on. You're going to get good results straight away. I suggest you just knock it back a little bit. It can be a little bit harsher in its starting point than the dehancer one. But overall, I've got to say, the dehancer one just has the edge for me. It's just slightly more subtle. It gives a much more pleasing look. Obviously, disadvantage is that you've got to buy it. I suggest that just buying it on its own wouldn't be enough. You'd probably want a little bit of bloom in there. So you might want to look at the pro version. But in my opinion, the dehancer one does just have the edge. The DaVinci Resolve halation is obviously a very welcome addition because it's saving us building up four or five different nodes to create that halation look. Both of them fantastic. But for me, the dehancer one does just have the edge. So there you go.
