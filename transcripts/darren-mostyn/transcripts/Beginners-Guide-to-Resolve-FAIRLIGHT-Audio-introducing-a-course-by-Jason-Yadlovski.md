## Transcript
So I've been using DaVinci Resolve for about 15 years now and as a colorist you're mainly going to find me obviously in the color page and the editing side of things I'm pretty good at as well but when it comes to audio I can do basic mixing but some of the more advanced tools are just a little bit beyond me. So I'm pleased to announce that my good friend Jason Yadlovsky has just announced his course called Audio Essentials for Video Editors and it shows you step by step how to go through and build up your audio projects in the Fairlight page. So this is going to be a fantastic course. It's hosted by dvresolve.com so they're fantastic as well and there's a link to it in the description but basically what you're going to get is a portal that you can go to, I'm going to show you that now and I've just started going through this but there are 27 modules in here that's going to give you 4 hours of expert tuition. Jason really knows his stuff. I've heard him do some seminars at ResolveCon and I've seen his stuff on YouTube. He knows what he's talking about with audio. So he's got clips that come with it as well so you get a whole project so he's going to look at how to fix things and what all the different tracks do, how all this works in the mixer. Let me just play through a little bit here. So it really is a full step by step guide and also what you get in here, if I just go up to here and go to the presets, Jason has also given you a ton of his own presets. So you just install these and he's going to teach you exactly how to use them. So check it out. Now I'm going to certainly have a look at it in my spare time, get my audio skills improved a little bit. Link is in the description. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
