So for those of you don't know me my name is Darren Mosten I'm a professional colorist and I run a post production facility down here in Brighton in the UK and I've been using motion VFX for well over a year now You can see that on most of my recent YouTube videos. They are literally full of motion VFX So I was actually really excited when the team at motion VFX reached out to me and asked if I want to curate my top Five choices so these are the ones that I use on my YouTube videos the ones that I use on my client work and It was actually a pretty difficult choice actually because there are so many to choose from this is in no particular order But I'm going to show you why I like them and how I use them. So let's go and take a look. So I'm in DaVinci Resolve version 18 I've got the edit page open. I've got my effects library selected and here you can see all the motion VFX that I've got installed I've got literally tons of these things and I've also got up here this hover scrub preview selected and that allows me to Take any one of these packs and literally just start previewing the templates So it's a really quick and easy way to just select the ones that you might want to use So the first pack that I've chosen is actually the first pack I ever used with motion VFX and that is M title hype I love this one. Have a look at these. These are really stylishly done and Obviously totally editable That's why I've still been using them a year later because they never look the same. So what I can do. Let's just grab on here I'll just show you quickly how it works. This is some images from an episode I made about motion VFX working on their iPad Which it does so I've got my iPad here. This project is shared in the Blackmagic cloud So I can open it on my iPad and still edit my motion VFX templates And not only does it work on the iPad But I've also got it running on my MacBook Pro because I get two licenses with each pack So let's have a look what we can do with this one. I'm just gonna highlight it. I'm going to my inspector This is not a tutorial on how to use them as such. I just want to show you what they kind of look like so let's have a look at this one and The content controls move the main positioning and scaling you can also do that here using the transform tool Which is a little bit easier because I can't you do on screen them? Okay, and what I'm going to do is edit this text. So let's go down to the title controls I'm gonna say I want to say edit anywhere. So I'm gonna say edit Using the outline text and what want to do is put the word anywhere, but in the red. So I'm gonna get rid of You've got what so it's gone. Let's go to here Change that to the word anywhere And you can see how easily I can just literally Reposition this and get it lined up. So you get really nice stylish text. Let's just make that a little bit smaller and Have a quick look at that And there we go, that looks super cool now I'm just gonna change the color because that red is a little bit garish Let's get something like that and we are good So there we go, obviously these effects are talking to fusion so that's the back engine which means these are super smooth They always look really smooth and well animated. So the next pack in my bundle is M title cinematic 2 I use this one all the time. It's a good classic go-to and you can see these are just really nice cinematic style titles Really smooth come on really nicely and I've got one on my timeline already. These are almost opposite of M title hype They're just nice and clean you always gonna need titles like this So I've got one here and on this one it says motion vfx presents cinematic titles I want to split those two up so the timing is slightly different So what I can do is press option on my keyboard and that would duplicate it And I'm just gonna separate the timing on my edits here So the first one is gonna say motion vfx presents It's all I've got to do is highlight it and then I can switch this part of it off These are totally editable and then I go to the second half and I'm gonna get rid of where it says motion vfx up there Let's just switch that one off and then I can come down here as well and Change this to be orange Whatever color I want and the color text here is controlled with the color mask width So again, this is just showing you how much fine-tuning you can do on all of these to custom and get them looking just how you want them So if I just the width here We can make as many characters as we want a certain color. So the third pack in my bundle is MKBHD I use this an unhealthy amount This is in nearly all my YouTube videos and I use it a lot in our corporate productions as well because it's got a lot of things Like I just show you these things that really help you for tech explainers So like this for example and these sort of things are really nice easy made graphics that I can customize really easily So let me show you a few that I use so this one here MKBHD feature 2 I use a lot. So I use this for things like when I want to say link is in the description So let's just do that very quickly. Let's just change that Just scroll down here and go to the shape control and I can switch that shape on and off. So this is obviously MKBHD sort of signature chevron thing I'm going to change the color for sure. Let's make it. I tend to use this blue down here that I've got set as a default So now when it flashes on it'll flash blue. There we go. And what I want to do is just change the arrow direction So it's pointing down and then I'm going to switch my transform tool on and I'm just going to place that down There somewhere where the link would be and I just copy and place that I keep that as a preset because I use it a lot And there's plenty of other things in here as well. So you've got lower thirds There are backgrounds things like that. So let's just go to this shot of the bike here Let's just put another little yeah, let's grab this one. It's like a tech explainer thing Drag and drop that on and in it comes so we can change all the text But you can see it's just got a really nice subtle glow. I love it. You can adjust the glow as well. So down here There's the glow element of it, but I want to change the color here. So let's get rid of that red and Let's match that to be the green off the helmets. So okay to that Let's drag that over there and then I could have this listing all the products on that bike for example So again really slick really easy to do so M keynote. This is the next pack in the bundle This is an absolute no-brainer. This has saved me so many hours in terms of making bar graphs and charts Timers countdown timers calendars all that sort of stuff. It's all built into M keynote. So this is an absolute no-brainer You've got all these boards up here. You've got call to actions You can customize all the colors obviously like you can with all the motion VFX So these are never gonna look the same twice. Here's one that I actually did recently So I use this one here. Let me just drag that on to my timeline All these elements are completely editable obviously and I made it look like from this which is the default into This which is a really nice looking graph showing the time differences rendering out different codecs So really customizable in fact what I did on this one is I've integrated two packs together So I've got M keynote and I've got MKBHD So you probably recognize these from the MKBHD pack and then I'm using the bar graph from M keynote So integrating two packs really good example of that here And I actually got commented on this on my YouTube someone said these that the graphics look really nice They were done really quickly just using M keynote and my last pack really had to be a YouTube one It's Mtuber 3 don't worry. There are other icons in there as well So if you're an Instagram influencer, you've got all the Instagram logos Twitter logos They're all in there as well. Let's have a quick look So there's backgrounds in here You've got all the sort of wacky backgrounds that people have on YouTube all these call to action so like and subscribe I don't like saying it too much in my videos So for me having a little infographic that comes up is much nicer for me So let's just have a look at one of these. I've got this one call to action 5. Let's drag and drop that on I've used this one before So it comes up with a little subscribe thing a little thumbs up and there's a drop zone in here So what I can do is highlight this go to my avatar controls Let's just browse and I can choose a picture of me There's my avatar in there and you can change its positioning really easily and The size all that sort of stuff and I can just move that down over here and that's done It's really is as simple as that so I really like that one down here You've also got here the regular social media icons. So you've got all the ones that you want So I sometimes put my Instagram handle up as well Let's put that on there and that one is actually 3d so any time you see them in 3d you can change them to be 2d I don't really like them being in 3d to be honest So let's have a quick look at that go to logo control. Yeah, and just switch it over there to 2d and That's ready to go. So picking just five was actually quite a task But I've done it based on the ones that I think have improved my YouTube channel The ones that have improved the quality of the content that I provide to my clients the ones that have saved me the most time Some of the ones have even allowed me to do things that would have previously had to outsource So I just want to say a big thank you to the team at motion vfx for letting me curate my own selection This is not a sponsored video. I've done this because I genuinely use this product You can see that on all my YouTube videos. So I hope you enjoyed it look after yourselves and I'll see you soon
