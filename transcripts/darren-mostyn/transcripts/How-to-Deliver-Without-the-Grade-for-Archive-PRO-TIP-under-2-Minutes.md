Hello everybody. Here to say congratulations to Darren for his 20k followers on YouTube. His almost-by-joke-started little bits and pieces of our Resolver works become a very great place where find information, tips, and whatever else you need to expand your knowledge. I mean, even for very successful people like myself, I like to go there. There are so many things that I don't know about Resolve. So thank you Darren and keep up the good job. So I just want to share a quick tip with you. This is a finished promo. This is a job done. It's been rendered out. It's gone to air and the Graded Master is sitting here. I've backed up the project and I've got the footage currently sitting on my server and that is taking up 616 gigabytes. So I want to get rid of the footage but before I do that, just for extra safety, I'm going to render out a clean ungraded version of this sequence. Now in order to do that, let me just get rid of these, you'd think it'd be pretty straightforward because you can go up to here and literally bypass the grade but when you go to the Deliver page, it actually still renders out with the grade on. So how do we get past this? One way you could do it is to go into your Color page, click on every single shot and highlight all the grades and literally press Command D and that would disable them individually but that's going to take a fair bit of time depending how many shots you've got. So go to the Deliver page and I'm going to render out a ProRes Quad 4 single clip and full resolution and what I want to do is go to the Advanced Settings here, scroll down and you'll see this down here says Enable Flat Pass. If I switch that on, what it will do is render out without any grades being included. So I just get an ungraded file which I can then archive off. So I just want to say thank you to Walter for his kind message at the beginning of this, look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
