## Transcript
So if any of you saw my previous two episodes to this, you would have seen me grade a TV commercial and you would have seen me do a grading a scene on a music video and both were shot using high quality cameras. This episode is taking it the next stage further and addressing a question I get asked all the time from people is can you show us what to do when we're grading Rec. 7 and 9, so not log footage, just it's already Rec. 7 and 9, generally phone footage and it's 8 bit. So what do we do? How do we treat it? How do you color manage it? And in this episode I'm going to show exactly what to do, what not to do and how to color manage it and I've got a few good tips and tricks on the way to stick with it. So basically what I did to get some 8 bit footage is I took my iPhone 14 Pro down to the beach, just shot some random footage. I'm no DP so it's not amazing but it does address the question and I've just put a few shots together that will allow me to show the do's and don'ts of working with 8 bit, Rec. 7 and 9, phone footage, drone footage, whatever it is. So let's go and take a look. Alright here's my 5 clips that I've selected. It's all 8 bit, this is all not using the ProRes that I can do on my iPhone but using the H265 codec. So it's much less data size so I can shoot for a lot longer on my phone for the same amount of storage but it is long gop so the quality is not as good as it would be with ProRes and obviously I've shot it 8 bits intentionally to address this episode. Alright so the first thing I want to do is not work with long gop H265 footage. This is not computer friendly. My Mac Pro 2019 is pretty well specced. It will play this footage well but even then I would convert it to something much more resolve friendly such as ProRes 422 HQ or if you're on a PC you might want to look at DNxHD or something like that but H265 which is what comes out of my phone is not resolve friendly. So the first thing we do is address that so let's go to our media page. Here's all the footage that I shot and you can see here that it's H265 and it's 1080 quality. In order to change that to be a more resolve friendly format I'm going to use ProRes 422 HQ and to do that it's really easy to use something like the Proxy Generator. So I'm going to highlight a few clips. I've already done quite a few of these clips already but let me just show you what happens. If I right-hand click you say generate proxy media it's as simple as that. However how does resolve know what to make it into? So if you go to your settings and most people when they think of proxies they think of low resolution but it doesn't have to be like that. Proxies don't always have to be resolution they're just a file that links to the original file. So in my master settings optimize media and render cache. Proxy media resolution is currently set to original. That means if I shoot 4k it's going to be 4k as a proxy so I'm not going to lose any resolution so these will come out 1080 and the proxy media format you can choose from very low files right up to ProRes 444xQ so you can go as high as you want. So I'm going to choose ProRes 422 HQ. There is built into DaVinci Resolve a proxy generator that works in the background but that currently has a limitation of ProRes 422 which is not HQ so I'm going to work with the proxy generator from within the media pool and let me show you how we did it. So all you got to do is right click and say generate proxy media that just happens. Once that's done we can go back to our color page or edit page or whatever you want to work in and we say playback and up here you've got proxy handling and it's currently set to prefer camera originals which is obviously going to be h265 because that's the original camera setting. I'm going to switch it to prefer proxies and now what it does you get a little icon down here and I now know that I'm working with ProRes 422 HQ files so it's going to play back a lot smoother it's going to be a lot easier when I start adding multiple nodes and my computer is just genuinely going to be a lot happier for it. So now that I've switched these into proxy I'm going to get rid of the clip icons just so we get a larger screen so you can see on YouTube a little bit clearer what's going on so I'm just going to close down the clips up there. I've still got the individual clips down here on my timeline level which is here and what we've got for our first shot here is just a shot of the beach. This is already Rec 709 so my output is Rec 709, my delivery is expecting Rec 709, this is already Rec 709 so I don't actually have to color manage it. This is ready to go. All I've got to do is start grading so you can just go okay let's start with my little bit offset. It actually looks really good already there's not a lot I would do to this let's maybe just bring down the lift a bit to get some contrast going in there and let's just have a quick look at the temperature but it's pretty good I did a little bit saturation. What you've got to be careful of when you're doing this is obviously 8-bit footage, its biggest weakness is the banding. 8-bit footage has banding you just have to deal with it and one of the key things I suggest to you when you're grading 8-bit footage is don't push anything too hard okay you really want to just try and keep that banding to a minimum as soon as you start adding contrast in let me show you let's just put some contrast in I'm doing it on the panel actually sorry let me do it on the interface and you can see it that's some contrast a bit of pivot the harder I push that the more you see this banding so there's one other thing I want to show you though before we move on to how to work in a color managed environment and I'm just going to add another node. One thing to be aware of is some of these tools in here such as the HDR tool the color warper for example are what's called color space aware so even if you're not in a color managed environment these tools still behave in a color managed way all right and what they're doing is looking at in your settings at the color management they're looking at this the timeline color space this is what determines how the color space tools will work and the color space aware tool such as the warper is going to look for DaVinci wide gamut as it's working color space so watch what happens when I use the color warper we're not in DaVinci wide gamut we're a rec 709 clip going to rec 709 at no point have I told this clip to behave in a DaVinci wide gamut color space this will all become apparent in a moment so watch what happens when I use the color warper I'm going to take some sky and look it's broken straight away and this is not because it's 8 bit footage this is because the color warper is working in DaVinci wide gamut color space and this clip is rec 709 I've not told it to behave and work in in DaVinci wide gamut color space so I'm going to tell the color warper to work in rec 709 color space because that is the color management that I want to be in so I'm going to go back to my settings here I'm going to make sure my timeline color space is set to rec 709 and press save now by default it will be rec 709 when you create a new project so you wouldn't have had to worry about that but I just wanted to highlight it in this episode so now you see we've got a much smoother behavior from the color warper let me just reset it and grab another one and we can get a nice pleasing result now really easily if we're careful not to enhance our banding so let's take a look at the second shot and what we've now got is a very simple color managed environment I've got my rec 709 to DaVinci wide gamut I want to color grade in DaVinci wide gamut color space so when I use that color warper for example I want it to be in DaVinci wide gamut color space because I've told it to be now and then right at the end I'm going to take DaVinci wide gamut color space back down to rec 709 and these are just csts I've done loads of episodes on this but I'm taking DaVinci wide gamut to rec 709 because that's what my display is my display is not DaVinci wide gamut it's rec 709 and I'm sending it up to DaVinci wide gamut on the first node here all right so these are just two color space transforms and we're grading in the middle now the first thing I need to do to make sure that my color warper behaves correctly because now I've sent everything to DaVinci wide gamut color space is make sure that matches in my timeline color space so I'm going to put that back to DaVinci wide gamut say save and just to show you if I disable this shift D I'm bypassing the entire grade nothing changes it's still exactly the same as the original clip because we've gone from rec 709 to DaVinci wide gamut we've done no grading and we've gone DaVinci wide gamut back to rec 709 so we've changed nothing we've just sent it up into a larger color space done nothing and brought it back down again so I hope that's clear by now this is the sort of probably the fourth or fifth episode I've done on this I still get asked a lot of questions so I'm hoping this episode does finally address those so bottom line takeaway of this you don't have to color manage it at all you can just grade in rec 709 I preferred method and probably a nicer way of working and if you're mixing it with log footage you need to work in some sort of color managed environment I've kept a very simple fixed node tree just for this episode to keep it simple all right so what we need to do now is just start grading so I can take my second shot here traditionally this would be my exposure so just lift our exposure up a little bit let's have a look at our color temperature it's a little bit warm so let's just cool it off a bit and bring my lift down that sort of thing and there we go and I always just switch the node on and off to check I'm doing that I'm actually improving the shot and that's looking pretty good let me just lift the gain up a little bit on that all right that's looking good it's probably quite heavy saturated up here but you get the general idea so small moves it's 8 bit footage let's not break it too early in the chain and this is my simple color managed pipeline so still the same node tree 709 to DaVinci wide gamut I've already done a bit of temperature and exposure on this shot just to get that going similar to what I did remember nice small moves because it's 8 bit footage and what we're going to look at now is adjusting the sky now this is your first point that you mustn't do with 8 bit footage and that start keying stuff you really want to avoid keying as much as possible the temptation here I'm going to move on to my third node is to take our qualifier here key the sky let's so for example I want to change the hue of the sky for example and we're going to go to our highlights all up here there it all is and we're going to come down here and we're going to change our hue just a little bit and it's actually worked pretty well in here but the danger is it's 8 bit footage your keying can fall apart really quickly so avoid using keying there is one exception to the rule in my opinion there's one thing that I do with keying in 8 bit and I'm going to show you that later so stick with it it's a really good tip but in my mind avoid keying at all costs so how do we address that sky well let's reset this one and what you want to do is as it says up here you want to use curves all right so get down to your curves and let's have a look at hue versus hue which is what I would use to change this sky and what we're going to do here is we're going to select the sky and you see we get this quite narrow range in our in our hue we want to make that range as broad as possible we're working with 8 bit footage so keep everything sort of light and gentle and because this is quite a narrow range when we push up extreme you're going to start seeing the edges very quick that's going to exaggerate your banding you just need to be really careful this so what I suggest you do is I'll leave that set there for now but just pull these out quite a bit and that way we've got to smooth the range just smooth the fall off and that's going to help hide that banding as best as possible now obviously I don't want my sky green so I'm going to pull this back and to me these little tiny moves just like that is plenty let me switch that on and off we've really changed the hue of that sky so just nice small gentle moves we're still protecting our banding I can still just see it just so you know by the way I'm using Camtasia as a screen record and it does introduce banding beyond what's already there so I'm looking at it better than you are on YouTube I'm afraid another way of quickly getting these to be broad strokes if I just reset that is you can literally go down here and choose any one of these vectors so if I press this one for example it's already set with a nice broad stroke so we can just push that up and we've got this nice roll off here all right so let's move on to our next shot exactly the same no tree I've got a couple of things going on the end which I'm going to show you but first of all I'm just going to pull my temperature down a little bit let's just bring our offset up bring our lift down a little bit and what's going on on the end here is a print film emulation LUT so this is the Kodak 2383 D65 that's built into Resolve I've done a whole episode on how these work this is a compound node so inside here I'll just show you again very quickly but this node here takes us into Cineon Film Log which is what this LUT is expecting and that's how it's working so well so I'm going to come back out of here and I just want to show you that you can use it with a bit footage so if I switch that on and on it's not doing any damage there whatsoever and that's because I know where this LUT came from there are a lot of YouTubers offering premium LUT packs that are going to transform your footage and make it look like I don't know a feature film just know where these LUTs have come from and know that they've been stress tested because this is going to break your footage really quickly you're going to see little sort of bands of desaturation and stuff if those LUTs have not been created scientifically and correctly just know where your LUTs have come from that's all I'm saying all right so I just want to show you that this does work with this shot so let me go back to here I've done my temperature and exposure I want to maybe just adjust what's going on in these blues here so I'm going to use hue versus hue as it's up already again just broaden out my hue range here and we can just make that a little bit more cyan that is obviously affecting my sky now so what I'm going to do is just add a little window around there you can use windows with 8 bit footage absolutely no problem let's fall let's just go around there something like that but make sure you get plenty of softness on your windows okay 8 bit footage you really do not want to see the edges the banding is always going to be what trips you up so that's now isolated so it doesn't affect my sky let's just check that's working yep so that's much better on there and I could keep adjusting that let's maybe bring down the saturation on the reds so let's sample that red there or what I could do just to recap on that is just hit the red here so I get a nice broad strokes and bring that down a little bit so I'm just bringing down the saturation here so it's not so poppy and the other thing I want to do just to show you that we can use sort of nice shapes and things it's on the end here I've got my classic vignette but if you have a look what I've done with it I've actually lowered it and what I try to do with vignettes that typically would be up here is avoid them going into the sky because the gradient here is going to fight with that banding so what I've done is I've still got it vignetted but I'm pulling it in a little bit closer and stretching out here and I'm just trying to avoid the sky if you're going to put a vignette on your image and you've got a lot of sky just be really subtle okay you need to be really really subtle all right so how do we deal with large expanses of sky where the banding becomes apparent so let's have a look at our last clip here so I'm going to move up this shot and you see we get into a larger expanse of sky and we really can see this banding going on which is caused by our 8-bit footage so how do we address that I've done a little bit of temperature and exposure on here already just to save a bit of time but that's all I've done so I'm going to move onto this note here and I'm going to use an effect called d-band now I spoke to you earlier about when not to use keying because we've got such a large expanse of sky here this is an exception to the rule in my opinion so I'm going to take my effects and I'm going to go to my library I'm going to search for one called d-band I've actually got a few here because I've got sapphire and boris installed on here as well which are fantastic plugins if you want a good recommend on some plugins but I'm just going to take the resolve one throw it on d-band and what it does is it softens all this out in quite an intelligent way but obviously we're losing detail in the clouds and if we go back here you'll see that we're actually losing a lot of detail in here if I press shift and F to give you an even bigger view and I'm just going to switch that node on and off I'm pressing command and D you see that all this detail down here is being lost with the d-band okay so how do we address that this is where I'm going to use that keying now keying is not clever with 8-bit footage so we're going to use it really loosely that is the key for this that we're going to use it really loosely so I'm going to move up here I'm going to take my keying tool I'm going to go straight to a 3d keyer I've got my highlight on so I can see what's being keyed and I'm just going to sample my sky okay let's just see what else has been included in there so we've obviously not including the the 360 tower itself that's the i360 in Brighton but we've got this going on here but it is affecting this logo on the cafe here so I just want to make sure that's not included in our key and there we go so that's looking good so let's take these lines off I'm going to take my highlight off we can now see that the tower stays nice and sharp and as we move down here this is all nice and sharp so I'm just going to enable and disable the node so what we get is nice d-banding in the sky okay but we are losing cloud detail now I don't mind losing a bit of cloud detail in this I can even use the sky replacement tool and add a little bit back in if I wanted to but I've really helped this d-banding going on here what I need to do though first on the key is loosen it up a little bit at the minute it's a little bit tight on the tower so I just want to make sure that there's no banding coming into here so let's just use there's a pre-filter here which really helps with 8-bit footage and I can do this clean back let's go back to our highlights also we can see what's going on and the blur radius let's really smash this in so we've got a really nice loose key on there now let's just check our blacks are good on there there's a bit of de-noise down here there's all sorts of things you can do just to make sure that that is loose you can even put some power windows in there as well if you want to and if you can't get a good key you could even just use a power window with some real softness on it to help areas of bad d-banding so let's have a look at that it's looking okay but those clouds are a bit soft up there so what I'm going to do is use my global blend and just bring it back so we've got a half mix of d-band and the original footage and that gives us a very good compromise for this 8-bit footage to make that sky look a little bit smoother now when you come to deliver this if you've only used proxies for your phone footage for your rex 7 and 9 footage as it were you can actually set a setting in the deliver page to force if I go to advanced settings to use the proxy media when it actually renders out and that way I know it's going to work with the 42hq footage and not the haste 265 it doesn't actually matter if you don't set that it's just going to render a little bit longer but I prefer to have that switched on just don't switch that on if you've used low res proxies for things like your arry footage or your red footage or something like that because then it's going to use the low res media as well right you've mastered 8-bit footage if you want to see how I grade 10-bit footage watch this video here look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode
