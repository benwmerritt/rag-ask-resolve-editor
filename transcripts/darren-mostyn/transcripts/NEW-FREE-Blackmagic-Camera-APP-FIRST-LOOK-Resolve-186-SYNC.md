Okay, so we're at IBC looking at some very exciting tech. This has just been announced. This is the Blackmagic Camera app. So this is effectively turning your iPhone into a Blackmagic camera. This is the interface that you'd be used to if you already own a Blackmagic camera. All the settings, all the functionality that you come to expect. But this is running on an iPhone. This is absolutely amazing. And what's happening is while this is recording, when I stop recording, the clip is being sent to the Blackmagic Cloud and is coming into DaVinci Resolve automatically. This is version 18.6. It's updating automatically via the cloud. Now the beauty of this is you don't need any technical setup at all. You just need a cloud account and it will send via the cloud to your DaVinci Resolve system and you can start working straight away. So this is allowing the creatives to get working immediately. You don't need any technical setup at all. So this is really exciting. We're at IBC all week. We're gonna be showing you exactly how it works. This is the Blackmagic Camera app. This is super exciting. Look after yourselves and I'll see you at IBC.
