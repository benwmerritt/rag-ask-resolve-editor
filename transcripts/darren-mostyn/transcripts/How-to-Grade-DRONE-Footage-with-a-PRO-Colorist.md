So in this episode I'm going to take a look at how to grade drone footage. I get requested all the time. Can you do a video on how to professionally grade drone footage? I'm having issues with it looking oversaturated and hyper contrasty before I've even started doing anything. So I'm going to show you why that's happening, how to fix it, how to grade it correctly, but first I need to get some drone footage. So what I did is I bought a drone and I loaded my van and headed off to Italy. The weather has been absolutely disgusting but I am nearly at the time. So I've got absolutely no idea where I'm going. I've literally just driving south through France and looking forward to a good sleep. I've had a really long drive for it but the satin has brought me to the Swiss Alps. It's absolutely gorgeous and I'm about to get on a train and make candlestick. That is absolutely breathtaking. That is tusky, absolutely gorgeous. So I just want to say a huge thank you to the team at Audio. They very kindly sponsored that section. We've been using Audio for months now as a library. It doesn't even sound like library music. The music on there is fantastic but what I love with the Pro Licence model is it covers me for social media, film and television. So it doesn't matter what my clients want, I know that I'm covered. They've given me a 70% discount for the first year on a Pro Licence. All the details are in the description so go and check them out. It's a brilliant music library and in the meantime let's go and grade this for tonight. As a professional colorist that is the most common manufacturer that I see for drone footage so I thought I would base this episode on that. Obviously there are other manufacturers but it's going to be the same sort of principle. Alright these are all H264 10-bit. Okay so one of the first problems you'll get with DaVinci Resolve if you're not on the studio version is you can't see H264 10-bit. You need the studio license in order to do that. The free version will just show this as media offline so that's a common thing that I see happening on forums. So make sure you're on the full version of studio if you're working with H264 10-bit. ProRes can come in fine. So this first one has come from the DJI Mavic Classic. Alright and these two here are from the DJI Mini Pro 3 which I've just shown you but the images look great out of it. Okay so the first shot we've got here has actually been recorded in D-Log. So the best way to get that to a good starting point is to use either a LUT or to use color management. So let me show you both ways. Now when you right hand click on here I remember the LUT should go nearer the end not at the beginning but just for the purpose of this I'm going to do it straight away and come down to DJI which is in your defaults and down here you have a whole list of LUTs but what you won't have is these two at the top DJI Mavic 3 D-Log to X7-9 and D-Log to X7-9 Vivid which gives you a slightly more enhanced contrast look. These two LUTs here I actually downloaded from the DJI website so I'll put a link to that in the description but have a look at the camera you've got and the profile that you recorded and you can download the correct LUTs. So let me show you what happens if you use the default ones in DaVinci Resolve. So this one's D-Log to X7-9 and it looks great the image is pretty good if I look at the waveform it's not over-contrasty it's not crushing anything the VectorScope's looking pretty healthy but I can get a better looking image than that by using the correct LUT from DJI. So let me show you I'm going to right click on here I'm going to get to my LUT and if I choose the one that I've just installed which is this top one you get a much better starting point all right so don't use the default ones that are in DaVinci Resolve if you're with me D-Log go to the website and check it out now to install that LUT so to show you quickly click on these settings go to color management and here you can say open LUT folder and it'll show you exactly where they are and you literally drag and drop the file that you download into this DJI folder here or you can put it into any folder you like. While we're in color management you'll notice that I've already changed my timeline color space to DaVinci Wide Gamma Intermediate and my output color space to X7-9 Gamma 2.4 so I did that before I started this project. Okay so once we've got the LUT on there we can then start grading and I suggest that you grade under the LUT so let me put a node before and then we're just going to here and we can literally just start adjusting this now so I would give it a little bit I was going to use the panel then I'll do it on the software so you can see what I'm doing but I would just play around maybe bring the offset down a little bit just checking our exposure is good and a bit more contrast in there maybe and it's a little bit green so I'm going to go down here to my printer lights and just pull that down a little bit there and something like that maybe start adding color temperature that sort of thing but the key to this is that you've got a good starting point by using the correct LUT and now what I'm going to do is use color management to do that so there's two different ways of doing the color management this is all documented on other episodes that I've got so I'm going to come down here I'm going to change my settings here to be YRGB color managed I'm going to say save and I'm going to get rid of these and then all I need to do is tell DaVinci Resolve what the correct color space is for this shot I'm going to input color space DJI and it is D-LOG D-Gammit so there we go so now we've got our good starting point so let's just compare that to using the DJI LUT so if I double click this still you see there they're very very similar very similar indeed actually but in fact I think I actually prefer the DJI LUT but genuinely if I can work with a CST or color management I'd much rather do that and that is just going to be a little tweak straight away so if I just go in there add a bit more gain to it and pull out a little bit of green I think we're going to get to a pretty good starting point so I'd be very happy using either the LUT or the color management so the other way of doing it is using CSTs and I've pre-built one here just to save a bit of time so I'm literally going to middle mouse click on this one here and that applies this I'm going to talk you through it so just remember I'm not in DaVinci YGB Color Managed which is going from DJI D-Gammit, DJI D-LOG and I'm sending it to DaVinci Wide Gammit DaVinci Intermediate okay so this is my first CST then we have some nodes where we do our grading okay which I'm going to do in a moment and then the last node here brings us back from DaVinci Wide Gammit DaVinci Intermediate to Rec 709 Gamma 2.4 so we've got a really nice starting point there it's going to work exactly the same as color management but I prefer to work with CSTs and so all we need to do now is start color grading but we've got ourselves a really good starting point and that is the key with grading drone footage is make sure your starting point is correct so let's take this starting point we've got here and apply it to the second shot so if I go to here and literally middle mouse click and that has copied that grade over so this is shot on DJI okay so we've got a DJI D-Gammit D-LOG going to DaVinci Wide Gammit and this one we're coming back again to Rec 709 we've got no grade applied on here but why does it look like this if you look at the scopes here the vector scope we've got our red is going absolutely off the scale here and our waveform is showing us we are black is set right on the baseline here potentially clipping and we've got a very high contrast going on here and we've not even started grading yet this is incorrect and this is because this shot whilst it looks very flat and log is not shot log it's actually been shot in D-Cinny like so what often happens is people shoot D-Cinny like and think that the D-LOG conversion is the correct way to go about it but quite clearly it's not okay and that is because D-Cinny like is not log it's actually Rec 709 so as you can see it's got a very flat profile and the idea is that you grade it okay it's not meant to be sitting like this looking good so let's just fix it so I'm going to put my nodes back on I'm going to go to my first node here and instead of being DJI D-Gammit D-LOG which is incorrect because it's not log we're going to make this Rec 709. Quick shortcut by the way if you just press R it will take you to the top of the R section and again here Rec 709 so just press R and it's Rec 709. I'm not going to use gamma 2.4 here because this is the source footage the gamma 2.4 bit comes here at the end because that matches my grading monitor. All right so we've got this pretty flat looking image now so this is not great but we're not damaging the image so normally what I would do first is play around with the exposure but in this case because the image is so flat I need to get some contrast in there pretty quick so let's go ahead and do that there's several different ways you can do that you've got the contrast tool here so we can play around with that or we can use our lift and gain so I'm just going to do it that way and just to get us in a ballpark really something like that now what I could do is play with offset but I just want to get a bit of saturation in there now I'm going to put my saturation a bit later I'm going to use the HDR tool here I'm going to go to my global saturation here and I'm just going to crank that up a bit in fact I'm going to crank it up quite a lot so it is actually a bright red van so that is going to feel a bit saturated but if you look on the scopes it's not going anywhere near where it was going before so that's a much healthier so now I can go back and start playing with my exposure obviously we're a little bit overexposed here so we can do exposure here as well there's something like that and as you can see that is a much better starting point than what we had a minute ago with that hyper saturation and massive amounts of contrast this is how I want to start grading this shot all right so we can go in now and just starting our refinements in there so again let's get in here we can use curves we can use all the tools that you're familiar with I'm just going to pull down a little bit more green at there maybe add a little bit of blue into it something like that let's just check the color temperature as well again I like to do that in the HDR tool something like that all right so that's how we start color grading and making it look good and there's a couple of other little tools that I use in DaVinci Resolve when I'm working with drone footage if we play this shot watch what happens so as we lift up I don't know how well you can see that but our exposure is changing slightly as we come up so obviously the drone is set to auto because I'm not a very good drone operator for a start but this is very common with drones okay it's got a tiny little camera on it it's aperture 1.7 and as it's coming up the auto exposure is obviously kicking in so I need to compensate for that I could do this using keyframes but there's a really cool trick that you can use so I'm going to add another serial in here okay and what I'm going to do is use this thing called color stabilizer I'm going to drag this over and what I've got is a region of interest okay so what I'm going to do is highlight this onto the region of interest this is what we're interested in using as our example to correct the exposure I'm going to press live region analyze which opens up these boxes and what I want to do is stabilize brightness I don't want to stabilize the white balance I'm quite happy with that I want to stabilize the brightness and the way that I want resolve to stabilize it is not with gain not with level and contrast but using offset offset gives us a much more even spread okay so it's a much more even tool so you're not going to notice it as much I'm going to press live region analyze again and now all I've got to do is press play and what that has done and in order to see that I'm going to get rid of this white box I'm just going to add another node is a very quick way of doing that and you can see now that the exposure has been balanced it's all even across the shot so that's a really good technique for using drones it doesn't work all the time but it works often so often with drone footage they have built-in auto sharpening and that can give a bit of a weird look on there and often you need to just soften it off a little bit and a good use of that is the texture pop tool so I'm going to drag that on I've done a whole episode on how to use the texture pop but what I'm going to do is just go to the advanced settings here and if I click here and show differences what it does is shows you what these sliders are doing but it's shown as an image on my screen as I move these sliders it shows me what's being affected now if you move to the left it's going to do smoothing and if you move to the right it does sharpening all right so we want to affect our sort of medium and small area not too much because I don't want the image to go too soft and if I now put that back on it just takes the edge off the sharpening that the drone has done and if we play that back it's just made that image look a little bit better so let's just copy that onto the next shot I'm going to middle mouse click and play that through and that looks great you might want to take off the auto stabilize here let's just reset that one and then what I could do is go into here and adjust my exposure manually something like that and play that through that looks great so there's a video here that will show you how to use the texture tool in much more detail look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next one
