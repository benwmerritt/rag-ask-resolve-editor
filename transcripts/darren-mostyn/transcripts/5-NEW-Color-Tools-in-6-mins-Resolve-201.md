So, it's been four months since the Blackmagic design team announced DaVinci Resolve version 20. We've had a few dot releases since, but today is an important day because 20.1 is officially out. It's got loads of new features across all the pages. I'm going to install it now. I normally install at a .1 release and I'm going to really quickly just show you some of the new features in the Color Page. Now, I've only had this running for about two or three hours, so I'm not going to go in too much depth, but let's go and take a look. So the main new features of 20.1 in the Color Page can be found up here in the Effects tab. Now let's start with this one, Light Raise. Now, this is not a new effect. This has been here for ages, but it has got a new element in it, which makes it look really smart. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to set up this Light Raise so it's coming out of this window. So let's just change that to be Angle. Let's just bring that over. There's something like that. I'm going to just soften it off a little bit in there, something like that, just for speed. And the other thing I need to check is in here, you can see that there's actually a Light Raise coming off this lamp, which I don't want to happen. I just want it to come out of the window. So let's go to our power windows. Let's just very quickly just draw around that so we can eliminate it. Obviously, I need to invert that window to make that effective. I always just put a little bit of softness on my windows anyway, something like that. Okay, so if I press Shift and Z, we get back to there. Let me take the power window off so you can see what's going on. Right, so we've got our Light Raise set up. Now the new addition in here is down here and it's called Atmosphere. Now this is fantastic because what this is doing, if I press Add Atmosphere, it's giving us particles. So as we play through, that's very subtle now. I'm going to have to increase this a bit. In fact, if I take the softness off just for this, you might want to see it a bit better. I'm going to have to strengthen that up. Just bring these up and you see now that this actually animates. You can just see that moving in there. Let me really exaggerate it so you can see what's going on. That looks really nice. We're getting a really convincing Light Ray coming out of there now. This is also available in the glow. So let me reset that and go to Glow. I love using glow. I use glow a lot. I probably use it more than I should actually. In fact, you can add a secondary glow now. So I need to have a play with that and work out exactly how that's going to help me. Like I said, I've only been playing this for a few hours. But in here, you've got exactly those same atmosphere tools. So really convincing glows. Love that. Next new addition really quickly. If I go into here is the face refinement tool. Now, the face refinement tool had a really great update in version 20 already, but they've added something else. Now, what I'm going to do is just detect her face. Let's just do a quick track of that. Like I said, this shot's already graded and color managed and I've rendered it out. So we can do this really quickly for you. And we just get that face refining going. Much more accurate. Remember, since version 20, you can actually keyframe these. Now, if it goes off, I've done a whole episode on how to do that. Right. So what's that's done? Let's take that overlay off. What I'm going to do just to show you the new feature. If I go to smoothing here, let's zoom in on her face and I'm going to use my middle mouse just to move that round. And what we're going to do is add a little bit of smoothing to her face. I'm going to exaggerate it slightly. I would never go that strong on that. But what we've now got in here is grain so we can actually put some texture back in. So again, another sort of texture tool for us to give us a more convincing smoothing there of the face refined. So just add that in. Let me go extreme so you can see what's going on. And there you can see the grain. Okay, let me take that on and off. On and off. So that is fantastic. Use it a bit more subtle than that, obviously. Okay, so moving on to another shot. What I want to show you now is a new effect. It's called color tone diffuser. This is an ARRI test chart. Let's grab this new effect, color tone diffuser. And what this is doing is allowing us to control the amount of diffusion and its color temperature as well. So how warm or cold that is. So let's just try out some of these presets and don't generally get on with presets. To be honest, so I'm going to go and do clean slate. And that actually looks like it's not reset. I still got an element on there. If I undo, if I bypass that, what else is on here? Image adjustment is like doing it. Now, I've only been playing with this for a few hours, so I haven't quite got my head around that. But I was hoping clean slate would give us an absolute clean starting point. Maybe that's coming in 20.1.1. But let's go down to custom because I normally like to build my own. So in here, what we're going to do is have a look at the diffusion. I need to switch it on. Sorry. So I'm going to be a bit more subtle than that. And down here, you've got control of the shadow and the highlights. So let's take our shadow here and obviously our threshold. The softness is going to adjust the roll off of that. So you can see that happening down here on our waveform. As our increase or decrease the softness, we're adjusting the roll off there. And the same with our highlights here. And this tone light allows us to adjust the color of this. So we can have the color of the diffusion altered just using this. So let's get rid of that. And what we have now is a new effect called split tone. So obviously, split toning is to give us that film emulation, allowing us to sort of cool off the shadows, warm up the highlights or make them any temperature that you want. But it gives us that film emulation. So let's have a look at the presets. We've got natural. We've got strong, which is very strong. That's giving us a really strong warmth in the highlights. And then we've obviously got custom down here. In fact, if I go to strong, if I change the strength, yeah, that does work. OK, so if I get to custom here now, we can adjust our own shadow strength here. And we can adjust the hue. So warm or cool. And again, the same with the highlights. Now this neutrals button, what this is doing is protecting our neutral. So if I put this on, you'll see if you watch here, where we've got colorization on, you'll see that this goes white. So we're protecting our whites and our blacks. So you're getting the nice split toning, but without affecting your blacks and whites. So really cool effect. And let me just show you that on a gray chart, just so you can see what's going on. By the split tone, there is our shadows. There's our highlights. And this is this point here is neutral. This is controlled by the pivot, which is here. So we can move that up and down. And get to our custom. And you can indeed adjust the strength and the hue of the shadows and the highlights. These are all really great additions to the color page. So I've already got an idea what I'm going to do with one of those new features in my next project. I'll do a more detailed episode as soon as I can. Think about subscribing if you haven't done so already. Look after yourselves. Enjoy your version 20.1 and I'll see you in the next episode.
