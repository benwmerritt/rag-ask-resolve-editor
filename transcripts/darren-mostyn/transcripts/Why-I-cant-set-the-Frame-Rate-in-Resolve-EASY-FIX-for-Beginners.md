So, you've been editing away in DaVinci Resolve and everything's going smooth until you realize that you haven't set your timeline frame rate correctly in your project settings. So let me show you. If we click on here and go to timeline frame rates, we are set to 24 and it's locked. I can't change that and I want this project to be 25 frames per second. So how are we going to fix that? So in this episode, I'm going to show you how to fix it. I'm going to show you how to set up correctly to start with and I'm also going to show you that DaVinci Resolve version 18 behaves slightly different when it's defaulting the timeline frame rate than version 17 and previous. So this is a beginner's episode. If you are more advanced user, you might want to check out some of my more in-depth episodes on editing and color grading. But for those of you who want to know about the timeline frame rate, let's go and take a look. So we've got an edit going on here and let's just have a look at what we've got in the media page. We've got some B-roll here. This B-roll is running at 50 frames per second because the idea is I want to slow it down to 25 and it will look nice and smooth. This is all footage that I shot for my vlog that I did earlier in the year. My main pieces to camera are 25 frames per second. So this dictates to me what the actual timeline frame rate should be because my dialogue is the main body of the program. So this is all shot at 25 frames per second and annoyingly, my project is now locked at 24 frames per second. So the timeline frame rate will determine how my program gets rendered at the end. So it's going to be rendered at 24. I've also got in here some stock footage. I want to use a little bit of footage of Vegas. This has come from Artgrid and often that footage doesn't match your primary frames per second. This is 23.976. However, I'm only going to use small bits of it. I don't really mind if that's incorrect, but I do want my program to be 25 frames per second. Right. So how can we fix that? Well, before we fix it, I'm going to create a brand new project and I'm going to show you how DaVinci Resolve behaves and why we got locked at 24 frames per second to start with. So let's do a brand new project. I'm going to click on here. I'm going to right-hand click and say new project and we're going to call this 25 FPS. Correct. And we've now got a brand new blank project. And just to show you in here, if I click on this little icon, our timeline frame rate is 24. And this is now editable. It's still editable because we haven't made a timeline yet. This is the key thing. So I could now set that to be 25 and that would be great. My project was locked at 25 and everything's good. Let's just leave it at 24 because I want to show you the mistake that a lot of people make and why this gets wrong in the first place. So let's press save. So it's still 24. It's still editable. So this is the default behavior. And I'm going to start importing my footage. Now, I want to bring in my B-roll, which is 50 frames per second. And this is a nice little tip. You can just grab a whole folder and drop it into the media pool, which means Resolve can see it. So up here, this is just looking at my hard drive. Resolve can't see the footage until it's down here. And it's recognized that this footage is 50 frames per second. So what it's saying is, would you like to change your timeline frame rate to match? Well, I don't. I don't want it to be 50 frames per second. I want it to be 25 frames per second. So I'm going to say don't change. So let's drag and drop this one in as well. And of course, my stock footage down here. I'm just literally dragging those folders in. And there we go. So what I'm going to do now is make our first edits. I'm going to go into the edit page. And the first thing I want to do is get a bit of dialogue from here. So Sunday morning, the show starts in about half an hour. Telling people arriving and looking forward to getting in. OK. So there's my first clip. And I'm going to drag and drop that down onto my timeline. And I could have done that using the F9 or F10 as well. But now that we've got a sequence, this timeline here, OK, if we go to our project settings, we are now locked. This is the point at which it locks your timeline. Now, in version 17, it locks when you first bring in footage. So at least you have a chance to get all your footage in. And you can still decide what your timeline frame rate is going to be. But now that I've created a timeline, the default project setting was set to 24. Right. So what I can do is undo that. I can click on here and I can now set it correctly to be 25. And I strongly advise that you do this as the very first thing when you create a brand new project. So let's say save. I'm going to change the project frame rates. And let's just add that clip in again. There is on my timeline and it's 25. Go to the project settings and there we go. We're now at 25 and it's locked at 25. So this is great. I can carry on working like this now. And what I actually want to check is when I go to deliver, the frame rate is locked now at 25. The frame rate matches the timeline frame rate. So had I set that to 24, I can't even override it on output. Right. So let's go back to the original project and have a look how we can fix that edit that we've already created. You might have been working for five, six, seven hours on that edit. You don't want to have to start again. So I'm going to show you a quick way of getting around that. So let's go back to that project. I'm going to go to my edit page. Here's our faulty edit. It's locked at 24. So what can we do? Well, we obviously do need to create a brand new sequence, but we can't change the project. But what we can do is have our sequences have an independent frame rate to the project. So I'm going to go to this little folder, critical sequences. Here's our current timeline. If I open up the metadata folder up here, you'll see that's 24 frames per second on that timeline. I'm going to right-hand click here. I'm going to say timeline, create new timeline. Now down here it says use project settings. If I use the project settings, this is going to be 24 frames per second again. So let's undo that. Now we get these headings at the top and this allows me to change all sorts of things. And in format, I can change the timeline frame rate. So let's make that to be 25. I'm going to say create. And I've now got a blank 25 frames per second timeline. So I could just start re-editing now. If I go up here and just start editing, and let's bring that click down again, that is now sitting in a 25 frames per second timeline, which we can see clearly here in the metadata. And if I go to deliver, it's now at 25. But the project setting is still set to 24. So this is a good way out of it. But that means re-editing. So what I'm going to do is go to my edit page. Let's get rid of that. I'm still on timeline two. And what I'm going to do is take that timeline one, and I'm going to literally drag and drop it into timeline two. So timeline one is now playing in timeline two. And I can't see the clips in there. But what I could do is right-hand click and say decompose in place using clips. And there is all the edits that I had in timeline one now sat in timeline two. You can see the little tick there. That is running at 25 frames per second. And that's all going to work really well. The other way I could have done that, if I just get rid of that, is I could go to my timeline one. I can highlight all the clips and say command C to copy, go to timeline two. And I can literally copy and paste. Now with this, you have to make sure you've got the right number of video and audio tracks or else it won't copy in to start with. So I prefer to do it the other way where you just literally drag it in. So this is now saved all the edit that I've done. I appreciate it's only a few edits here, but imagine that was a much longer timeline. So hopefully that has helped you to understand what the timeline frame rate is. Now there's one other thing in here that I just want to show people. And the playback frame rate is still editable. That's because the playback frame rate is independent of the timeline frame rate. The timeline frame rate is what will be rendered out at the end. But the playback frame rate is allowing me, so a good example of this is when I'm doing grading and I grade a long form edit, so you might have five, six, seven hundred edits in there and you just want to watch the grade back, but maybe twice speed. So if my project is set to 25 frames per second and I set my playback frame rate to be 50, I can literally just press play either on my panel or on my keyboard and the timeline by default will play at twice speed. And this allows me to view the program at twice speed. So it's basically allowing me to just visually check it without having to watch the whole hour. So the playback frame rate is completely independent of timeline frame rate. So I hope that's helped you understand why this timeline frame rate graze out. It's basically as soon as you have a timeline on there, it's going to lock how to overcome it and hopefully have to set it up correctly to start with. I have other beginners episodes.
