So, in this episode, I want to show you the quickest and easiest way to import material from any nonlinear editing system into Resolve ready to do grading work or fusion or whatever you want to do with it. So in the previous episode, we looked at how to import from Premiere using an XML, which you can do with other applications as well. But that relies on us linking to the original media. Now, the advantage of doing it the way that I'm going to show you is we work with one single exported master from Avid, Final Cut Pro or Premiere, whatever you're using, and we bring it straight into Resolve and we use an EDL for Resolve to automatically choose the edit points so that we can grave straightaway. So it's a really quick and efficient way of working. So this is the sequence that we want to take into Resolve to do our color grading with. This is the same sequence that I did an XML workflow for in a previous video. And this time, we're going to do it via an EDL. So we're going to really simplify the process. This is Premiere. You can use Avid, Final Cut, any editing system you want. This process will work exactly the same. So let's take a quick look at what we've got going on on the timeline. We've got a graphic at the front. We've got a title here with a bit of a fade up on it. We've also got a bit of color management going on. So there's a bit of a look going on here. If I just match frame that, yeah, you can see that we've got our log image here and we've just put a bit of a grade on it just for the edit purpose. We're going to remove that, by the way. And then I've also got a dissolve here. So we're going to keep that on. The EDL will quite happily take dissolves across. We've got a video layer on video layer two, which we're going to have to address. All the video tracks need to be on video track one. And moving through, we've got a picture in. Oh, it's not a picture. It's just a cutaway there and moving through. We've got some picture in picture work here. Now, if you've got a lot of picture in picture work going on or effects beyond cuts and dissolves, this is not the workflow for you. You need to look at the traditional XML workflow that I talked about in that previous episode. But if it's just one or two, like we've got here, or just a handful that's quite easy to manage, what we can do is address this. So I'm just going to see what else is going on. And we're all good. And we've got to just fade to black at the end. So the first thing I do before I start addressing these things is make a copy of this sequence. We always want to keep our master sequence intact. So I'm going to go up here and depending on which system you're using. So in Premiere, I just hit duplicate here. And I'm going to call it four grade. And make sure that I'm on this one. So in fact, just to be sure, I'm going to close that one down. So what I can do now is start getting all this in good preparation for the EDL. First thing we need to do is get rid of the graphics. So let's just get rid of that. And we also need to remove any color correction because obviously we want to color correct in DaVinci Resolve. So let's just zoom in there. And I think it's just these first ones here that have got it on. So I'm going to just say remove attributes. And there we've got the limetry color. So they're now gone. I'm going to keep the dissolve on the EDL will support dissolves. And I'll show you how resolve handles it, even though we're going to export a flattened file with a dissolve baked in the EDL handles this really well in resolve. So I'm going to leave that dissolving. OK, this track here needs to come down to once I'm just holding my shift key at the same time that keeps it locked so we don't move any frame either direction. And we've got our cutaway here. So again, that needs to come down. So here how we're going to address this is I'm going to leave this in situ here. I'm going to leave it exactly where it is. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to match frame each of these. So if I press F, what it does, it gives me the mark in the mark out that that is the same duration as this. And I'm literally going to take it and drop it on the end of my sequence. And then we're going to rebuild it after. So I'm going to grade it as a full frame shot. And then we're going to rebuild it later back in Premiere. So do the same on this one. Let's just match frame that. Drag and drop that on. And you see, I've just left a small gap here to say that when I'm in the edit, I know that these are my extra bits for visual effects. So I'm just going to leave those where they are. Or you could remove them if you want, but I'm just quite happy to leave them in. Then it gives me a visual reminder of what's going on. Now the EDL is just going to ignore this track up here. And I'm going to go along and there's a fade to black at the end. Now I like to take those off because if I'm doing any color correction, a fade to black can actually get some color correction in it. So it might start looking a bit warm or a little bit cold. So I'm just going to take it off and we can reapply that after. Oh, in fact, the other thing I do just to keep things tidy is I take off the audio. But what I'm going to do is export out first and then remove the audio so that when we export our files to take into resolve to grade, we've at least got audio on it. So what I need to do now is make a high resolution version of this sequence. And this is the actual sequence that we're going to grade. So I'm just going to do a mark in and a mark out here because we've got some extra stuff here. So I'm going to get rid of this stuff because that will come across in the EDL. So make sure we got a nice clean timeline. So I'm now going to press command E to export this out. And I want this the best possible quality that I can get. So work at your highest resolution that you can. This footage was originally 4K. So ideally I would be exporting out as 4K. But this has been made in a 1080 HD timeline. There's quite a bit of resizing going on and some picture in picture work. So I'm quite happy at this resolution, but ideally export at the best resolution that you can. I'm going to up this from ProRes 4 to 2 to something a little bit heavier ProRes 4444. If you're on a PC, of course, you want to export that as something like avid DNx HD. Choose one of the sort of higher resolutions. Let's put this on maximum quality. Let's get rid of that timecode. And let's just send it to the right place. So I'm going to put it into my conform episode. And I'm going to export that. So once that's finished rendering, what we're going to do is remove the audio. Remember, we've still got the audio on the original sequence. So I'm just going to get rid of that so that it's not included in the EDL. So now I'm now going to go up here and say file, export, EDL. Now in Final Cut Pro, you can't export an EDL without a particular plugin, I believe. So what you're going to do in Final Cut Pro is export an XML and I'm going to show you what to do with that afterwards. So what we're going to look at here is the tracks to export is video track one. We don't have to have include audio levels on them. We can take that off and pretty much take it as the default. Secrets 01, EDL. Say OK. And I'm going to just put that into my conform episode and that's done. Now what I'm going to do is export an XML as well because I need to show you what to do if you're working with Final Cut Pro. So you don't have to do this if you're working in Avid or on Premiere, but I'm just going to send this out so that I can show you what to do. So I'm going to take my XML, I'm going to put it into my conform episode and that's done. So remember, you don't need to do that if you're working in Premiere and Avid, you just export an EDL. So we've now rendered out a brand new master file, high quality. We're going to use the EDL to chop it up in Resolve and we can literally start grading on it. So why would we work in this workflow as opposed to the XML workflow that I looked at in another episode? The main advantage of working this way is that you don't have to conform. So the file is literally baked. Any resizing we've done in Premiere or Avid is baked into the file. So we know it's going to be accurate. There's no way you can lose clips or clips can be offline or if you're working with archive material, it will always be there because it's baked into the file. It makes it really simple. The other advantage of it is it's really quick. You literally load that file in, apply the EDL. The EDL's got all the information in it that it needs to chop the clip up so you're working really quickly. And a huge advantage is the file sizes that we're working with. You're working off one master file from one high resolution master file. This might be just four gigs, 30 gigs, even if it's 100 gigs. That project might have been originally terabytes. So you literally don't have to have all those camera rushes, which are very large files these days. You're just working off one flattened file. If you're working remotely, this is a really good way of working. If your editor is somewhere else, they can send you this file. Whereas if they have to send you all the camera rushes, that could be quite a task. So the file sizes are smaller. So the disadvantages of this workflow is that you are working with a baked file so that the edit is fixed, which is quite a good thing these days I think, but the edit is absolutely fixed. You can't start trimming it. You can't export with hand rules. It's a flattened baked file. You also restricted to one layer of video. So an EDL can only export one video layer at a time. So you can't do complex multiple picture in pictures and things like that. An XML workflow could read multiple layers, but an EDL workflow is restricted to one video layer. So you're really looking at this as a good workflow for general cuts and dissolves style editing. You also lose the raw metadata. So if you're working with camera rushes that are raw, you lose that metadata. It's stripped off when we export that out as an Apple ProRes or as a DNxHD file. So color management becomes a little bit trickier, but you still have the whole dynamic range of the clip. You can still work in logs. So we can still use our LUTs or our CSTs or resolve color management, but you're working on a flattened file and it can be a little bit harder to determine what the actual camera is. So this workflow is much better than using the scene cut detect because the EDL is giving us accurate cut points. So we're straight away working and we now just need to get that into resolve. So let's go and take a look how we do that. So we're now in DaVinci Resolve. We have a blank project. This is a brand new project. I'm going to go to my settings and let's just check a few settings off. The first thing you need to be aware of is the timeline frame rate by default is 24 frames per second. If the program that you've just made is anything other than 24 frames per second, you need to change this. Now because I'm working in a brand new project, when I import that clip, it will warn me, but I'm going to set it anyway because I know that that is 25 frames per second. And the other thing I'm just going to do is go to my color management and I'm going to change it from Rec. 7.9 scene into Rec. 7.9 gamma 2.4 because that is what my monitor is calibrated to and that's what I want to work with. So I'm going to say save. And what we need to do now is import the file that we just created. When you're working with EDLs, it's a good rule to follow even if you're working with more than one clip that you put it into separate folders because the EDL wants to point to a folder and not a clip. So you'll see this in a moment, but I'm going to right-hand click on here. I'm going to call it sequence 1 and I'm going to make sure that there is only one sequence in each folder. So if you're working on, let's say you've got a series of 10 sequences that you've worked on, you need to put each of those clips into 10 different folders. You would have exported 10 EDLs and you'll see why in a moment. But just one clip per folder. Okay, so I could find my clip in here and go through all my different directories or I can just bring up finder here. There's my conform episode. There is the file that we made. I'm going to drag and drop it into this folder here and that's good to go. So we can see that's 1920 by 1080, 25 frames per second. We've got an Apple ProRes 4444. You might have a DNxHD, but we've got a nice master file ready to work from. Okay, so here's our file. You can see there we've still got that effect going on, but we're going to deal with that. So if I literally now bought that into an edit, it would just be a single clip. So what we're going to do now is use the EDL to chop up the clip accurately on all the edit points that we had in Premiere or Avid or whatever you're using. So what you need to do is go to the edit page and I normally put each timeline in the same folder as the clip is. So if I've got 10 sequences, I'd have 10 folders and folder one, I'm going to import that first EDL. So what you need to do is right hand click in here and you go to timelines and you say import and we don't want this EDL here. What we want is this one, the pre-conformed EDL. Okay, and what a pre-conformed EDL is going to do is ask you which clip you want it to be associated with. So I'm going to press this now. I've got a point to the EDL, which is here. I'm going to open it up. It's going to ask me what I want to call it. I can just call it the same name as I gave it originally. You can't have duplicate names. I'm going to say okay. And what it's doing now is looking for the folder that the clip is in. This is why it's imperative that you have each clip in a separate folder, otherwise you can't identify it. And EDL doesn't really associate with a clip. We're just matching edit time codes. So I'm going to scroll down here. If you've got a lot of folders here to select the right one, if you deselect the top one, it then deselects them all and then you can choose the one that you want. I'm going to say okay. And what that's done now is take our flattened file, our single clip and it's put virtual edits or actual edits into the clip to represent each point that there was an edit in Premiere. So if I just go through here, if I go back one frame now, there's an edit point. There's another edit point. There's another edit point. But obviously these have all come from the same .move file that we created. So now when we go to the color page, you're ready to grade. The whole edit is completely chopped up for us, ready to grade. So there's a clip. There's a clip. There's a clip. And these are all separate scenes ready to be graded. So we've virtually chopped up the whole sequence and this is more accurate than using the scene cut detect because there's no errors can occur. This is coming from an EDL. There's a little picture in picture sequence that we're going to look at, but we're going to not grade this because that would be very hard. We'd have to track these shapes. But what we can do then, if you remember, we put the two files separately on the end. So they're now just as whole clips. And then what we would do is export that back into Premiere and rebuild that little picture in picture. So how's it doing it? Let's have a look at what an EDL looks like. So open up either a text editor or notepad and you can see here, this is the EDL that I exported. Okay, it's just a simple text file. And what it's doing is saying, click one. Okay, has got video on it. It's a cut. The original file is this timecode, but the master sequence started at 0, 0, 0, 0. And the cut is at one second, 23 frames. Then clip number two will start at one second, 23 frames and goes on till two seconds, 24. So this is how it knows where to put the cuts. So the only columns you're interested in is this one, which is in and this one is out. So it's a timeline in timeline out. Okay, recording record out. This is the only column you need to worry about. You see here are dissolve. So the effect name is cross dissolve. And it puts all the parameters in there so it knows how long to make the dissolve duration. And so that's how it works. So the information is coming from these two columns here and it just splits up that flattened file according to what's written down here. But what's important to note with EDLs is all it can bring across is speed changes. It can bring across dissolves and wipes. Nothing complicated though. It can't bring in things like resizing information and scaling information. But the main advantage of it is the simplicity in which it can just chop a flattened file. It gets you working super quick. So the other thing to be aware of is that we've got this dissolve in our EDL. So we bait in the dissolve into our flattened file. So let's just see how resolve actually handles it. There it is there. So if I just click on this shot here, we can see here, if I play that through, we'll see the dissolve. So what happens is that we grade each side. So let me just do a very quick grade here. Okay, something like that. And then I'm going to copy that grade over. Okay, but what I'm going to do is just exaggerate this one slightly. Let's just make it a little bit cooler. Okay, in temperature. And what you'll see is that resolve has added a cross dissolve because the EDL says it's a dissolve. So the dissolve is real. So as this image goes into this image, there is a cross fade which helps blend the two different color grades that we've applied, even though it's a flattened file. So watch this. So it's pretty unnoticeable. I mean, technically, it's not quite right, but you really do get away with it in most instances. I mean, even if I made this black and white, just de-saturate the whole thing, you still wouldn't really notice it. If you really wanted to get these technically accurate, again, you would export them out in Premiere as two separate elements and then rebuild that cross dissolve. So there's a little bonus tip with this episode. And if you hit the link in the description, I've just done a very short piece on how to use the EDL to help you with your color management. If you are enjoying this episode, I put a lot of work into these. Hit the thumbs up for me. Maybe think about subscribing and enjoy the rest of it. So what happens if you're coming from Final Cut Pro and you can't export an EDL? To do this process, resolve, expect an EDL. It can't do this process with an XML. So what you would do is you go to your edit page and you say timeline, import, XML, points to your XML, open it up. Don't put any of this on. You want to take all this off. Say OK. And what you get is this. So it's going to give you an error. What I'm going to do is get rid of this one up here. So this is the XML. And you can see that it's trying to link to the original files. We don't want it to do that. We want it to link to the flattened file that we've created. So then what I'm going to do is right hand click on the XML that we've just imported. I'm going to say export and I'm going to use this one here, AFXMLEDL. So I'm going to click on that. I'm going to change it down here from being XML to being an EDL. I'm going to call it XML. To EDL, I'm going to put it in our same conform folder. I'm going to press save. And now I can do is get rid of this. I don't need that anymore. And let's just reimport that. I'm going to right and click say timeline, import pre-conformed EDL. So remember, we're doing this if you're using Final Cut Pro because you can't export an EDL to start with. Here's our XML to EDL that we've just created. I'm going to open that up and I'm going to point to the bin where our sequences, our flattened file say, OK, and there we go. All done. And all we need to do now is go into the color page and just start grading. We can then export that out, put it back into Premiere, put the graphics back on, put the audio back on, and you're good to go. And we can then rebuild that picture in picture using our full resolution images that we've got on the very end of our sequence here. So I hope that's helped you find a really quick and easy solution to get color grading with Resolve no matter what non-linear editing system you're using. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
