Colour space transforms. This must be the most talked about subject on DaVinci resolve forums that I've seen for a long time So in this episode, I'm going to demystify. What is a colour space transform? How does it work? Is it colour management? Is it better than colour management? Where does it go in your node tree? All these sort of questions are going to answer in this episode So this is a really good one for beginners But if you're intermediate it might answer some of the questions that you have as to where it goes in your node tree For example, so let's take a look So I've got some footage here. This is some Arri footage and I've got some red footage here as well So I'm just going to show you a couple of different colour spaces to work with So my colour space transform is here It's in my effects and I literally drag and drop it onto my clip and Nothing happens because I haven't actually set anything yet and just to show you we are in Colour management here. We are in a non colour managed environment. We're in DaVinci YRGB Colour managed is the next one down. Okay, so we're in just regular DaVinci YRGB I've got my timeline colour space set to DaVinci wide gamma intermediate and my output colour space is Rec 709 gamma 2.4 because I'm delivering this for broadcast This is for HD regular television If you don't understand that I've done an episode called are you colour space aware and it will explain what those settings are doing So you should check that one out. I'll put a link to that in the description So here is our colour space transform. What is a colour space transform? Well, a colour space transform is a way of working in different colour spaces on a node by node basis So I want to take this image which looks very flat from its arry colour space profile Into rec 709. All right, and to do that I could use colour management. In this case, I'm going to use a colour space transform So there's two things that you need to Tell DaVinci Resolve when you're working in colour space transforms The first one is what's your input and the second one is what's your output? So our input is arry log C. Okay, I know this came from an arry camera and it's arry log C So I'm going to say I'm going to say here in the colour space Arry wide gamut 3 and my input gamma here needs to be set to arry log C3 and That should put us into a very nice starting position But this looks terrible. Okay, and the reason for that is our output colour space is currently set to use timeline and our timeline colour space Is DaVinci wide gamut? So it's not rec 709 gamma 2.4 So it's not going to look nice the idea here Remember is to colour manage your image so you've got a really good starting point for your grade I want to get the image looking as the camera intended it to be So I'm going to change my output colour space as well I didn't get that to be rec 709 and we're going to choose Gamma 2.4, which is a broadcast standard and now our image looks great. This is ready to grade All right, so what I'm going to do is grab a still of that and just very quickly going to prove to you if I've reset that node I'm just going to show you that that's exactly the same as going to colour manage here Saying save and there's the same image. So if I do a split wipe on these you'll see they're absolutely identical All right, so the colour management in a CST is the same as the colour managed However, I have control of where it will go in the nodes So the next question is where does it go in my node tree? Does it go at the beginning? Do you do this to start with do you do it at the end? You've probably seen in my Programming and my node trees that I work with my CST at the end But I'm going to show you an extra little tip as well from that so stick with it Right, let's come out of colour managed I'm going to put that back to the vintage wide gamut and I'm going to put my apple colour space to be rec 709 gamma 2.4 and To get that CST back on there. I could just drag from here. However before I do that. I'm going to put three nodes on here Okay, so what I'm going to do now is show you Why I think it should go at the end and not the beginning. All right, so my colour space transform should be at the end So first of all Let's put it at the beginning. All right, so I'm going to drag from here So I've literally just taken that node and dragged it on the first node here So there is our setup arry wide gamut at arry log C input to Rick 79 gamma 2.4 and these two nodes are empty So they're effectively doing nothing So if I go into my second node here, even though it's labeled node one it's actually the second node because my path goes from here to here and What I'm going to do if you look at the parade here. We've got a really nice clean image here This is pretty good We've in fact we could probably not need to do too much to this but I'm going to go extreme here and just show you I'm going to take my offset wheel and I'm going to push it hard Okay, and you see when it gets to the top here it clips So we actually start losing data off the image. This is because at this point here We've taken a big large arry color space and we've condensed it down into Rick 709 So let me show you on my See how each out here. There's our that's our color space That's how large our color space is from the camera and this is Rick 79 So it's a much smaller area that we could work in and what we're doing on the first node is putting us into that smaller area So when I start playing with all these tools here, we are hitting the boundaries of Rick 79 very quickly So he can see my parade we've now hit the limit now if I undo that so let's just reset that Okay, what we're going to do now is put the CST at the end instead of the beginning. So I'm going to use this trick I'm just gonna use command and drag which will literally swap the node order. Okay, so it's command and drag My CST is now on the end. So we're still getting arry to Rick 79, but I'm going to grade underneath that CST So in here. So this is why I prefer the CST workflow over the color managed workflow because in the color managed workflow It's determining this order for me, right? I'm going to do exactly the same step I'm going to take my offset and I'm going to push it hard and what you see this time is we get a nice roll off Okay, because we're working in a much larger color space first and then that is being brought down to Rick 709 Not we're going to Rick 709 first and then we're pushing our levels. All right So it's a much larger working color space that we're in So that hopefully proves as to why I know this is extreme, but I'm not losing the detail the detail is still there All right, I'm going to reset that Now the color space transforms and I was to go from any color space to any color space So what we could do is work a little bit smarter than this So what I'm going to do is take a color space transform. I'm going to put that in the beginning I'm going to say our input color space is arry as we already know And our input gamma is arry log C3 But my output color space instead of sending it to Rick 709 gamma 2.4 What I'm actually going to do is put this into a Larger color space. So I'm going to put it into DaVinci wide gamut This is actually a bigger color space than the arry color space, but it's a very good Intermediate working color space. It's very good if you've got mixed camera formats like we have here We've got arry and red so the DaVinci wide gamut is a good intermediate one to use my output gamma needs to also be set to DaVinci intermediate So what we've done here is take our arry color space and we've sent it to DaVinci wide gamut color space now What we can do at the end Let's put another color space transform. So this is going to be our grade This one on the end what we're going to do is take our input color space And it's not going to be arry this time because we've set arry to DaVinci here So it's actually we need to go from DaVinci color space Don't you buy gamut DaVinci intermediate and now we're going to send it to Rick 709 So I'm going to say output color space Rick 709 gamma 2.4 Okay, this still looks exactly the same. So if I double-click this which was just our arry log C to Rick 709 And wipe you see again. They're absolutely identical Because what we've done is taken arry to DaVinci here We're then going to do all our color grading in the middle in DaVinci wide gamut color space And then we're going to go from DaVinci wide gamut again down to Rick 709 So we've effectively just built a new pipeline. We've got our start and our end just to show if I push the extreme We still get that nice roll off. We don't get any clipping occurring. So it's a really good workflow Okay, so let's take this to the next level. What I want to do is get a really efficient workflow going on here We've got our first node here This is taken us from our camera manufacturers color space to our chosen working color space in our case DaVinci wide gamut This could be aces if you prefer to work in aces is absolutely no problem with that as long as your final CST in your program Takes you from that same working color space down to Rick 709 This is it's at the final bit that we want to funnel it down to Rick 709 color space In the middle of that you've got your grade So this could be one node 20 nodes 30 nodes doesn't really matter what's going on there But we're going to keep that as a blank node for now and we're going to make this really efficient So the thing that's unified between all the clips in our timeline will be our grade So I'm going to keep that as a blank for now and our final CST, okay We're always going to go from DaVinci wide gamut to Rick 709 So these two things are common the thing that changes is the first one because this depends on your camera manufacturer Or indeed if you're working with archive footage or iPhone that might just be Rick 709 doesn't matter It still needs setting because we're going to send it to DaVinci wide gamut So what I'm going to do is I'm going to right-click. I'm going to reset that node and we're going to save this as A node tree, okay, so this is going to be my very basic fixed node tree if you like, okay so I've got two nodes and I've got that CST on the end taken from DaVinci wide gamut to Rick 709 now what I'm going to do is apply that to all the clips in my timeline So if I select all my clips and just middle mouse click this one So now you can see that all the clips in my timeline. I've got exactly the same node structure But they're all wrong because they're all starting in DaVinci wide gamut and going to Rick 709 Whereas these are arry and red so what we can do is use groups and this is really going to help us So I'm going to take our red footage. I'm going to highlight it all I'm going to right-click I'm going to add it into a new group. Let's call this red And now because these clips are in a group what we can do is go to our group pre-clip selection and We can use a color space transform To tell it that these clips are red So I've only got to do this once and it will apply to the whole group So we go red wide gamma RGB and we're going to go red log 3g 10 And we're going to tell it's going to go to DaVinci wide gamut because that's our working color space So I'm just going to set that up here and all these clips are now set correctly Because they're in a group so this is done at group level and then all you got to do is go on to your clip level And we can just start grading away however many nodes you've got there ready to grade and your final CST is going to take you from DaVinci wide gamut back to 709 so really efficient. So let's just put our arry clips in a group and do exactly the same I'm going to say add new group. Let's call it arry So all our arry clips are now in a group So I'm going to go to group pre-clip make sure you choose pre-clip and not post-clip because you want to happen this before you start The grade I'm going to put my color space transform on and we're going to tell it It's arry wide gamut and it's arry log C3 again. I'm going to send it to DaVinci wide gamut DaVinci intermediate and These clips are all now correctly set up ready to start grading So if you come out of our group into clip and we're good to start grading so you can just far away here Just to show you that's all nice and smooth No clipping occurring and we're good to go if you want to see how to do this in a color managed environment click on this video here Look after yourselves and I see you in the next episode
