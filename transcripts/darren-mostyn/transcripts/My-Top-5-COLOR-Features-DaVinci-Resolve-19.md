So DaVinci Resolve 19 is here and it is jam-packed with fantastic features in all the pages, edit, fusion, fairlight and of course color. So I'm going to show you a few of my standout features in the color page, but stick to the end because I've got one little surprise one that I want to show you. So there really are a lot of big features in the color page. So I'm still getting my head around it. So this is just going to be an introduction. I'll do more detailed episodes later on. So the first one that's caught my attention is this one here called color slice. This is fantastic. So it's giving us six vectors. So it's our red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta and a seventh one, which is skin tone. Now the vectors are based on these presets that we've always had in here. These have been here since Resolve version, whatever. I can't remember. They've been here for a long time and it's a very nice organic way of just taking a color slice and adjusting its density and saturation. So let me show you if we take red here, you can see the slice there. Here's yellow. You can see the slice there and we can adjust the center of the slice. So you can adjust the exact point at which it's going to pivot around. This is a really nice organic tool. So there's no need to do keying or anything like that. So watch what happens when I just read. So if I take this one here, this is density and this is saturation. And if I just push density up, watch the red square here on the color chart and you'll see that it does indeed become dense in a really nice organic way. Now, if you want to see what's actually being affected, you can click here and it will show you what's being affected. So it's got a natural sort of fall off and you could adjust that center point if you wanted to get a bit more accuracy. Let's have a look at that on skin tone. So there we're just adjusting our skin tones. OK, and saturation. So what we can do is start playing with these vectors and then bring skin tone back and things like that. So let's take a look at this on a practical example. So I've got this shot here. This is just a very simple notary that I've got going on. So it's going Canon C log 2 to DaVinci Wide Gamut. DaVinci Wide Gamut back down to REC 709. And I've done a little tiny bit of balance here, not a lot, just bringing down a little bit of offsets. So let's see what we can do with the color slice. So obviously if I take this here, it's going to adjust that taxi and the letterbox there with the density and the saturation. So it's saturation out. And again, you can see how organic this has got really nice fall off. It's not affecting anything else. But let's say, for example, we wanted to work on this building here. We want to get the color right on this one. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to find out which one it is. So I'm presuming it's going to be either blue, which is not or cyan. So there, cyan is picking it up. But it could be a bit more accurate if we adjust the center control. So what I'm going to do is put my highlight on. And this is going to allow me to see all the time what that science is doing. So now I can adjust my center. I'm just checking that I'm getting the best point. There you go. So now so you know, plus or minus one on the center. So now I'm getting a little bit more of that cyan captured within the color slice. So what I'm going to do now is take my highlight off and I can start adjusting the density. Here. So there we go. So now I'm adjusting that. And it's also bringing in some of the other colors here that are in that same color slice. But we could put power windows around this and I'm going to just increase the saturation again. And there we go. So if I take that on and off, we've got a really nice adjustment of that building without doing any key and work at all. So this is a really nice way of working. I'm really loving this tool so far. And across the top here, you've got global density, global saturation, that kind of thing. So we could apply our density globally and then fine tune each vector on its own merit. So let's just take a look at one more example. If we click on here, this is almost the same grade as I did for this Christmas music promo. It's not quite the same. It's a bit of a simplified no tree here. But I just want to show you what we could do with these jumpers, for example. So if I take the red again, let's have a look at what's going on. And they're completely covered within this slice and what's the difference here? So this is just regular balance contrast, bit of saturation and that sort of thing. But watch what happens now. If I go into an empty node, I'm going to add some density and look how much richer those jumpers look. It looks absolutely fantastic. Now, what we can do is just check that we're not adjusting skin tone here. So if I click on here, so we are getting a little bit of the skin tone creeping in only slightly. So A, we could start playing with the center. So let's put that highlight back on and just check if there's not a better place for it. In fact, there is probably slightly better capturing the jumper. Take the highlight off again. And if I wanted to, I could pull back a bit of saturation in the skin tone. And that's done. So the next thing I want to show you is in the effects. And there's lots of new effects in version 19. But this one is a particular stand out for me. So let's go to the effects here. And it's this one here called Film Look Creator. And it's doing exactly what you'd expect. This is for building film looks. So traditionally, film look would be near the end of your node tree. This is a very small node tree here. But let's just throw it on the end here. And obviously just before my CST. And let's have a look at what this is doing. By default, it already has a look. And what this is not doing is doing film stock emulation. It's actually just to build your own film look. So it's Blackmagic Design's own film look creator. So you're going to get some pretty exciting results out of this. So the default is 65 mil. Let's just have a look at a few of the others. And you've got a cinematic one there, bleach bypass. All your favorites are in there. But let's start off with, in fact, let's go default, no effects and build our own. Oh, in fact, what you can do just to show you the color blended. You've got several settings. You've got color settings and then you've got your effects. Okay. So the color is these settings here. So it's exposure. I'm going to show you that in a moment. But we can actually set that back down to zero. So we've only got the effects going on, which would be halation, grain, bloom, that sort of thing. And we can kill those as well. So let's put them back on and let's have a look through it. So if I'm going to go to custom here, the color space overrides. What this is doing is by default, this is going to work in the timeline color space that you're working in. So I am currently in DaVinci Wide Gamma Intermediate. All right. So this recognizes that color space, but you can override it here if you're working with a particular, if you're working with Ari or Sony or whatever color space you're working in, you can do that here. Oh, the 3D look compatible here, by the way, if you switch this on, it will eliminate any effects that can't be transposed into a 3D look because some of the effects are baked in to this. All right. So the color settings, let's have a look at what we've got. We've got exposure. This is photometrically accurate exposure. So this is a, this has been a fantastic starting point even if you want to adjust your exposure correctly. Contrast highlights and fade to fade to shadows. So this is adjusting our highlights. This is adjusting our shadows. The white balance here is using chromatic adaptation. So it's a technically very good way of doing white balance. So let's have a look at that. You can see that we get really pleasing results there. Tint, skin by subtractive saturation. So this is actually using subtractive techniques, which is a much more filmic look. If you watch my waveform here, as I increase saturation, what you don't get is an increase in luminance that you would traditionally. Richness is just going to enhance the richness of that and how much bleach by actually wanting there. That's quite nice little slider in there. So that's the color settings. I'm doing this really quick. I'm just giving you an overview. I will do an episode on this much later that will go into this in a bit more detail. Halation. So you've got all the cool things that you're going to need. Let me just move my scopes out of the way. Bloom, grain. So you've got all your grain. So these are the tools that have traditionally been in result, but they're now neatly in one effect. So this is what makes this really cool. You're going to use one node to build up this film look, which you can just copy across all your program. Flick a gate weave. I'm not going to get into all these in any particular detail, but what I do want to show you is this split tone. So to show you that better, if I go on to a grayscale here, let me show you exactly what's happening with that. Let's put the film creator on. Again, we get this sort of filmic look already. So I'm going to go in here, say no effects. Let's switch on split toning. So what split toning is doing is separating your red, green and blue channels in your highlights and in your shadows to give you a much more filmic look. So if I go amount, obviously it's zero at the moment and watch the waveform here. Let's bring this up. Get a little bit bigger still. And as I increase the amount, you see that our highlights start separating. That's our red, green and blue channels. If you want to know how to do that, by the way, if you click in here and go RGB instead of Y. And if I, and then you'll also see there's a pivot point here at which point there is no split toning. Obviously that would be your sort of mid-gray point traditionally. And then coming down to our shadows, we see that we're splitting again. So how does that look on the actual grayscale? If I increase the amount by a lot, you're basically seeing that we're getting cooler shadows and warmer highlights, which is a very traditional filmic style. You can adjust that with the hue. If you want to go your own particular mood, that's absolutely fine. And you can adjust the pivot point. So obviously that amount is a bit extreme. You wouldn't go that far. You'd have something much more subtle like that going on. But this is a great tool to have inside one big effect. So I'm really looking forward to playing with Film Look Creator a little bit more. So the next effect I want to show you is also in the effects palette. So I'm going to click on here. And if I go to the library, it's this one here called Defocus Background. So watch this. I'm going to go to this shot here. I'm going to grab that, drop it on. And what it's going to do is allow me to defocus the background. Obviously, we've got to give it some information about what the background is. So to do that on this shot, really easy. I can just go to the magic mask here and click on the people icon. Let's just grab them. Let's just track that quickly. Okay. So what we can do now is start playing with our effects. So obviously we've got blur moving that way and we've now blurred the background. So it looks really good, but there are advanced options in there as well. So we can saturate that. We can colorize it. We can go to our advanced options and in here you've got lens or Gaussian. So lens is going to give you under the right conditions. If you've got sort of highlights in there, it will give you a slight sort of bokeh effect. But the Gaussian, if I click on Gaussian, gives you a little bit more subtle effects in here. So I'm liking this one. So there we go. We've just made a really nice quick defocus background. Obviously, to get rid of these lines, if you click in here, you can get rid of those in here. Let me just enable and disable that and you get a really good defocus effect. And just to add to that, if I go to the beginning of this shot, just one thing I also noticed in here, in the noise reduction tool, in the spatial noise reduction, you've now got a new option in here. And this is called ultra noise reduction. And what this is doing is automatically adjusting the noise reduction for you. So watch this. If I click on there and say Analyze, it's looking for an area that it wants to measure the noise reduction and it's adding its own parameters in here that it thinks are correct for the noise reduction for this shot. So all I've got to do now is press play. So I'm finding the playback speeds with the ultra noise reduction are slower than the traditional noise reduction. This just for reference, this is a Mac Studio M2 Ultra, but it is doing the noise reduction for me. And if you're not happy with it, you can tweak that. So I would just be adjusting the luminance first and then maybe the chromium if I need to just to perfect it. But it's going to certainly give you a very good ballpark. So the node tree we're looking at here is relatively straightforward, but often I work in much more complex node trees. And the next new feature I want to show you in DaVinci Resolve 19 is for much more advanced node tree operations. So it's called node stacks. If you don't work with complex node trees where you're doing multiple different versioning, you might be in HDR passes, trim passes, that sort of thing. Then this next feature might not be for you, but for those who do work with advanced node trees, you're going to love this. So what is node stacks? Let me first show you how we work traditionally without node stacks. So I've got a group going on here and I've got the same group here. So this group here, these three shots here are using one of my more complex node trees. So what we've got going on here is the balance and the look that we've got going on for this particular clip. Now, pre that in our group, I've got my color space transform taking me from in this case, Blackmagic Pocket to DaVinci Wide Gamut. And then post group, I've got a bit more of my look development going on and of course going from DaVinci Wide Gamut to Rec 709 Gamut 2.4 or 2.2 or whatever I'm delivering to HDR, whatever that may be. If you don't understand groups, you might not get this either, but this is really aimed at people who do understand grouping and work with complex node trees. So let me show you what's happening now. So if I move forward from this group, what I can do is split all this into individual node stacks. So I'm going to move on to this one here. OK, and the first thing I'm going to do is get answer here and go to my general options and at the bottom, it says node stack layers and you can have up to four different node stacks. OK, so at the minute we want one, I'm going to go to four. I'm going to say, you can label them whatever you want. At the minute, I've just got them as L1234. It could be primaries, secondaries, power windows and trim pass or something like that. So think of those four stacks as four different elements that you'd be working on. So instead of having that large node tree that we've got going on here with our group pre and our group post, what you can do is move forward into this. And what we get now is we still have our group pre. So that would still be my color space transform. Then what I've got is my layer stack one, layer stack two, layer stack three, layer stack four and then my post group. OK, and you can have that you can just have two layer stacks if you want, but you can have up to four. Now, the beauty of this is I've got my group pre and then my first one is just for doing my basic balance. So this is getting the clip in its right place at a clip level. OK, this now looks much neater to work with. If I click on the next one, what I've got going on here is my initial secondaries. And once this is where I'm doing a little bit of log control, I might be working in just the highlights. I might be using a color warper. That sort of thing. All right, so this now looks a lot easier for me to control. The third one I've got going on. This is for my power windows and any keying that I might want to do. And then my fourth one here is my look development. So this for me is a really great way of working. And also on here, then at the end, I've got my DaVinci wide gamut back to Rex, whatever my output is, and that is that post clip level. So what's the big deal about that is exactly the same way of working. But when we come to saving this as stills and copying it across and doing what's called ripple grading, which I do quite a lot of. We have a real advantage in here. So if I go to our gallery, let me create a new still here. Okay, and click on our clip level. Okay, what I can do is save this. I'm going to grab this as a still. If I right hand click in here and say display node graph, I've got in here layer one. I've got layer two. I've got layer three and layer four as separate node graphs. Now, what I can do is copy one node stack to another clip, just that node stack. So imagine you're with a director and you've got a one stack is for your director's tweaks. If you like directors trim, you can make those changes and then you could just pass that layer stack on to all the other clips in that scene or in the whole program. And it won't affect your clip based leveling where you've done your balancing and your contrast and that sort of thing. So this is really cool. So what I can do is right click on here and I've got a new tool here that says apply active layer. And what this will do is if I go to this shot here, let's just make a change on here. If I go and I just my printer likes a little bit here. Okay, and then I'm going to copy that still. What I can do is then click on this shot here and click on here and say apply active layer. And there is just applied that. If I had done changes to all these five nodes, it would apply those whole five changes. If I just want to do that one particular node, what you can do is say is go display no graph. And I can then literally just copy and drag it like so. I want to apply the entire grade right and click and apply grade as you would typically normally. So this for me personally is one of the most important additions to DaVinci Resolve 19. Working in these different stacks and being able to copy just one stack to multiple clips and groups is going to be really efficient for me moving forward. I just love the way that it looks as well. Just spitting everything up into different sections. So all my power windows are here, for example, is much neater than working. I mean, I'm very used to working like this, but it's a different world from that. So I'm really looking forward to exploring that a little bit further, but that's fantastic. So that's node stacks. So we're really just scraping the surface here of the new features. There are so many new things in here. Even on the editing side, now you can edit via dialogue. Fusion's got new additions. There is an update to the trackers as an intelligent tracker in here now. But just before I go, just want to show you one really cool thing that I found and it's to do with audio. So let me go and show you. So moving on to the edit page. Let's have a look at this music video that I did for Beardmeats Food at Christmas. This is produced by Get Your Media. And I've got my audio track levels here. So we've got voice isolation. This has been improved in 19. The dialogue level has been improved. We've got dialogue separator. We've got a thing called ducker, which is going to take any soundtrack and automatically duck it under voiceover. But I want to show you this music remix. So this is a lot of fun. So let's play a bit of soundtrack. I'm going to put that on. So what this is going to let me do is completely remix this soundtrack. So the first thing I'm going to do is take the voice out. Fantastic. I'm going to bring the drums and bass up. And I'm going to take the guitar out and then this one called other, which is, I guess, sort of random other stuff that's going on in the background. Absolutely fantastic. So I've completely remixed that track and it sounds brilliant. I don't know what it's going to sound like with other genres, but it sounds fantastic. So let's reset those and let's just do it using these items here. So some really fantastic new features got into DaVinci Resolve 19. The development team have absolutely smashed it once again. Tools in there that I didn't even know I needed. Can't wait to really start deep diving into this and playing with it a little bit further. I'm going to do some more deep episodes when I get my head around it. Enjoy DaVinci Resolve 19. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
