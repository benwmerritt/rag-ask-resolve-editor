## Transcript
My name is Darren Moston and this episode is slightly different in the fact that it's already been out on YouTube. So Alex Matravers who runs a brilliant channel called Mr. Alex Tech asked me to do a guest slot on his Five Minute Fridays and so I did and this is that episode. I thought I'd just put it up on my channel just in case you missed it on his but I'll put a link to his channel in the description. Check it out because it's a brilliant channel. He's a top lad and basically this is an extension of the A7S3 video I did a little while back so I've just done a few more colour tips on there, a few tips and techniques so let's go and have a look. So this footage is from the A7S3 and this was a grade that I built for an episode a few weeks ago called How to Grade Sony A7S3. So you can have a watch of that episode it shows you node by node how I built up this look from this to this using this exact node tree. And I've now bought in a second shot and I've just started to do a little bit of work on it just to try and get it balanced. And apart from the waveform there's another tool that can help me just check that the white balance is good and if you right click in here and say show picker RGB value then your qualifier gives you the exact RGB value of the pixel that you're sitting on. Make sure you're on the qualifier mode and so as I sit on his t-shirt here you see that I've got 222, 226, 223 so that's a good white balance and I can see that on the waveform as well and if I come to this side you'll see that blue is slightly dominant in this so the white balance is slightly cooler and again I can see that on the waveform. So it's just a really handy tool that's the RGB picker. Okay so I've got my base grade down now and I want to actually match this shot to this shot so there's several things I can do to help that. Firstly I could just try and copy the whole grade if you middle mouse click on any icon it will copy and paste the grade and you can see that quite clearly doesn't work so I'm going to undo that straight away. And what I'm going to do is take this shot I'm going to grab as a still so just right click in the middle here and say grab still and what I really want to do is just take bits of this grade and apply it to the second shot. I've already done the sort of base grade on there so it's pretty close I just want to get some of the more detailed work and copy it across to save me having to rebuild it. So for example this node here the highlight node was actually quite a lot of work so it's quite precise so I'm going to click on the shot I'm going to right-hand click in here and I'm going to say display node graph and what you'll see then is the node tree inside this graph so I can now select any element from here and drag it over. Now there's two ways of doing this you can either drag literally and drop you see the plus arrow let go and that goes in. If I undo that another way of doing it is just say add a node and just drag and drop it onto the node and if I drag and drop any of these on to an existing node it will overwrite the properties of that node so it's a really useful tool. So I get a lot of comments from people wanting to see the open effects in a bit more detail so I'm going to show you one now that I use a fair bit. Let's go back to this guy here and on this node here we basically did quite a bit of work on the skin tones so I'll just show you before and after so we took all this sort of pinkiness out and we also did a little bit of mid-tone detail to help his eye bags here but I'm going to go one step further than that so what I'm going to do is add a serial node next to this one so alt S and what I want to do is key the skin exactly the same as this shot here so I could go ahead and re-qualify that or I can just take the key that I've already done here and pass it through to this node so I'm just going to join those two so that's key out to key in and I've now got the same qualification on the second node so let's open the effects and I'm going to take this one called color compressor and drag and drop it onto that new node now when I'm working in the open effects I very often work in this mode so shift and F and what you get is a nice big screen but you still can see your open effects tools so it's a really convenient way of working and you can put your node tree back on here as well if you want to so what does this do basically this is going to try and compress the color to become a certain color so what I can do is take this tool here I'm going to sample the skin color that I want it to be in the end so let's just take that there so there's our value and now when I can press hue saturation and luminance individually they're basically trying to get so in this case I'm trying to get the hue to match that color I'm trying to get the saturation to match that color and on this one I'm trying to get the luminance to match that color so you can see extreme what happens I mean if I go really extreme it looks ridiculous so luminance is the one that causes the most damage so be really careful in luminance if at all and you just want to play with these sliders and we can switch that on and off here and that's just smoothing out a bit of that red for me and I'm just going to blend it back I always put a bit of blend in on this tool it can look really plasticky if you don't use it carefully so again sparingly is the way to go with this and that's looking pretty good so let's bring back our nodes and get rid of the open effects for now and I just want to label this node so traditionally right hand click and say node label but I did quite a lot of node labeling so I'm going to assign it as a keyboard shortcut so in here we go to keyboard customization and if you go to the all commands here and just type in here label and it's under the node section here and all you've got to do is double click in here and then assign the key so I'm going to assign it to the tab key which is currently empty so just press tab press save and that's done so now click on here if I press my tab key I can just type in here CC for color compress ok so you see on here on the end we've got a vignette so I'll just switch that on and off so you can see it's quite subtle but I use vignette quite a lot so what I want to do is actually save this as what's called a shared node so if I right hand click on here and say save a shared node it now wants a new name in here so we can now use our tab key as our label because we've just assigned that so I'm going to press that I'm going to call this vignette I'll call it vignette soft and say ok and that is now a shared node so if I go into this shot here what I can do is to add another node I can right hand click and say add node but this time I've got the choice of the shared node as well so there's my vignette soft and if I press this one it adds a new node with that vignette softness already on it so that's quick and easy to do just be careful though because the node is locked so any changes you want to make you can right click and deselect the tick box there now it's free to use so I can make any changes I want but any change I make to this shared node will affect all the other times I've used this particular shared node in the timeline so just be careful of that but shared nodes are really nice and quick and easy.
