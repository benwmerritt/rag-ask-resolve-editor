Now as a colourist you don't often see me in the Fairlight page but these two new tools that have just arrived are insane. So let's go and take a look. So in the edit page I've just thrown together three or four clips from a recent vlog that I did and the audio is pretty bad, I don't have a very good mic for vlogging so I'll just play this one. Right I'm at Brighton Coach Station on my way to Resolve Con. Lot of background noise, lot of cars and stuff, this is inside a restaurant. Ten to three, I've landed in Seattle. So obviously a lot of clattering going on in the background and then this one's on a plane. Right, so I'm on the smallest plane I've ever been on. So let's go into Fairlight and see what we can do about the audio. Now these are on track one and over here you'll see now that there's new track effects. There's this one here called Dialog Leveler and this one here is voice isolation. So let's have a look at what they do. So I'm going to switch on the Dialog Leveler and I'm going to click on here and open up the menu. There we go. So the Dialog Leveler, let's just play it through. I'm going to switch it off first and then I'll switch it on while the clip's playing. Right, I'm at Brighton Coach Station on my way to Resolve Con. It's about six months ago. I was in this very spot on my way to NAB. So you can see that works very well there. Let's do it on the restaurant. Ten to three, I've landed in Seattle. I've had about a ten hour flight. And then one on the plane. Right, so I'm on the smallest plane I've ever been on in my life on my way to... So what is the Dialog Leveler actually for? Its main purpose is to balance different audio levels of human beings. This is artificial intelligence, so it's looking for human voices. And using the three different categories that you've got here to reduce loud, to lift soft, and to reduce background noise, you're going to get a nice even tone of multiple people in the same room. So this is not a brilliant example because obviously I'm hidden here on my own, but it is doing a good job of at least reducing the background level. So it's a track level effect. It's using artificial intelligence and it's recognizing specifically human voice. And I can also increase the output gain here and also you've got some options in here. So I've got it set to Optimize for most sources, but there are other options in there as well. Alright, so that's the Dialog Leveler. Let's take a look at the Voice Isolation Tool and click on the menu and up it comes. Now it's just a single dial on this one, minimum or maximum. And let's just go and have a listen. So I'm going to switch it off first. Right, I'm at Brighton Coach Station on my way to ResolveCon. It's about six months ago. I was in this very spot on my way to NAB. And as you can hear, this does an amazing job of clearing out the background. So I'm going to switch it off again. So looking forward to it and I'll see you there. 10 to 3, I've landed in Seattle. I've had about a 10 hour flight. I mean that is a really good flight. Can't complain. Satin is a really nice man. Let's just try it on the plane. Alright, so I'm on the smallest plane I've ever been on in my life on my way to Eugene. So it's doing a brilliant job. Now you can actually turn this up to maximum, but what I'm going to do first is show you just how well it's working. I've got a clip here. I'm going to switch it off first. And this one I've actually added some sound effects to it. Right, I'm at Brighton Coach Station on my way to ResolveCon. It's about six months ago. I was in this very... I just made it a lot of metal clashing and stuff like that. By the way, if you want to add sound effects, if you go to the sound library, you can just search for crashes or whatever. In fact, if you don't know what you're searching for, if you literally just type in three stars and press return, it will display your whole audio library. So I just added some crashes and things like that. So if you had to use this clip, this is your only take and you needed the content out of it, this voice isolation tool is going to do wonders. So I'm going to switch it on. Right, I'm at Brighton Coach Station on my way to ResolveCon. That's six months ago. I was in this very spot on my way to the NAB. Now, if I actually crank this right up to 100, it's actually going to take out all of that background sound. So watch this. Right, I'm at Brighton Coach Station on my way to ResolveCon. It's about six months ago. Now, admittedly, my voice sounds a little bit weird there when it's on 100. So I'll just dial it back a little bit. And I'm sure you'd agree that if I literally had to use that clip, that was the only take I had for what I was saying, this would do an amazing job of that. So just put that back again. Right, I'm at Brighton Coach Station on my way to ResolveCon. It's about six months ago. I was in this very spot on my way to ResolveCon. Unbelievable. So their track effects only at the minute it's using AI. This is looking for human voices. So I think a lot of people find the Fairlight page quite daunting. And if you feel the same about the Cut page, you want to check out this video here where I go step by step on exactly how to use it. Complete beginner's guide. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
