Hi, my name is Darren Mostyn and in this episode we're going to be looking at tips and tricks in the deliver page And I just want to say a huge. Thank you. I've got my first thousand subscribers last night I'm genuinely pleased. I can't believe it's happened quite so quickly, but thank you all anyway and Let's get on with this one. So tip number one is quick export You don't have to use the delivery page in order to export We've got some presets up here and these can be found in the other pages so if I go to the color page and We've finished our grade and we want to export this out now. You can just go file quick export and Then we see our presets up here and you literally export Find your location you want it to export to and press save and it's done So it's really quick and simple this operation can be found in the cut page and the edit page But not fusion and Fairlight now if you want to add your own preset go to the deliver page Put your settings in that you want. So I'm going to make a ProRes quad 4 preset at HD Click up here and say save as new preset Let's give it a name And you now see this set here in our presets So in order for it to appear in the other pages you need to click on here Quick exports now the quick export that we just made here is not in the list of quick exports And the reason being is we're currently set to individual clips now a quick export can only do a Single clip it wants to take your 20 or 30 shots in this instance and make a single file out of a single graded file Whereas at the moment we're set to individual. So what we need to do is update this setting So let's switch to single clip click on here and We say update current preset and now you'll see the quick exports has it in our list So we can include it in the quick exports click on here That's the color page file quick export and There you see our preset that we've just made it's in HD 25 frames a second apple ProRes quad 4 Just press export save and that will render out to the location that you set here so tip 2 is expand view back in delivery page and Nice and simple this one up here. You have a way of expanding your settings box So just press on here and now you've got a really clear view of all the settings that you might need to use Tip number three is check your clips This is a really good practice to get into a habit of doing and before every render I always check my grades up here. I go to clips and Down here I can filter them and what I do is I go to ungraded clips And the reason being is that I don't grade in a linear fashion necessarily on long-form programs Especially I'll grade one scene that might be halfway through the program Then I'm back at the beginning and I'm all over the timeline So it's very easy sometimes to actually forget a clip So it thinks I want to render just this clip and I'm in single clip mode so it won't allow me So I'm going to say apply filter And then it puts it into individual clip mode which I can change after and now the clips highlighted I can go back to my color page There's the clip highlighted Copy the grade with the middle mouse click there Back to the delivery page and now I can clear this filter off By going here and saying all clips And then we can put it back onto a single clip if we want to so I really recommend you do that And you can also filter things like you can look at tracked clips Noise reduction clips sometimes I take noise reduction off temporarily so I can search for all my clips with noise reduction And just make sure I've applied it back on So tip four is disable updates during render So if you go up to the main menu You've got an option here called updates during renders which can be set to off minimal or on and what this does Is give you a live view as it's rendering so you're actually looking at the render happening So if you're running on quite a slow machine you can literally switch this off And so you won't see the preview while it's rendering but your render performance will be quicker Which also reminds me if you press p you can look at full view in the delivery page Tip number five is use commercial workflow And what this does is allow me to render out my grade but with all the versions included as well So some of these clips have got separate versions of the grade different options And we can render those out into separate folders quite easily. So if we go up to here and go to file And come down there's an option called use commercial workflow But it's not enabled until you go to individual clips. You can't render out a single clip and do this workflow So down here now we have used commercial workflow click on that What I want to do is place the five versions here Into separate folders And I want the name of those folders to be the version name So it would be version one version two etc And you can rename versions to be something that might be more suitable to the clip So this is a common workflow in vfx as well So you can send different versions to the vfx department tip number six is additional outputs So when I render this I can actually make multiple versions of it. So let's have a look. I'm going to take off that commercial workflow Let's go to our video and I'm going to do a master in apple pro res quad 4 in 1080 hd Let's just give it a name And the client wants to take away a hd 64 version So I'm going to go up here and say create additional video outputs And you now see I've got a number one which is our pro res quad 4 And in fact, I click on number two we get a shortened dialog box Which allows me to quickly dial in whatever I want. So I'm going to put in Hd 64 as it was data burning would allow me to export with burning timecode for example So I might do two versions one with and one without And I'm going to put a sub folder in here So the hd 64 version we're going to a sub folder called 01. Let's just do Let's say these three clips. So I'm going to do mark out here Mark in here And let's get rid of this one I'm going to add it to the render queue and the difference here is that you only get one job So I've got two files being made one in pro res and one in hd 64 But it's seen as one job and the advantage of this is when I start this render Is it does it all in one pass? So you only see the video going through once so if your clients sat with you and they're just watching the render They're not going to see render once for pro res and then render again for hd 64 You just get one simultaneous stream of the render So it's a really quick and easy way of doing multiple versions And if you want to delete a output you can click on it and just press delete output down here and it's gone So tip number seven is nice and simple show job details And what this does is allow me to see a bit more information in here about what's actually being rendered So if I click here show job details now, I can see that it's the apple pro res quad 4 in hd So it's just a little bit of reassurance as to what that job is So tip number eight is instagram formatting So these days it's not unusual to be asked to output for instagram particularly when we're grading branded content material So we have to do mobile phone portraits We have to do instagram and we have to do regular 16 by 9 So how do we go about doing that? So what we have to do is change the resolution in here So we'd have to do a custom resolution and for instagram it would be 1080 by 1080 But there is an easy way of doing that So if we go into the cup page We can click up here and there are presets for full hd For portrait mode for mobile phones and also for square for instagram. So if we press on the square formatting And then go back to the delivery page It's now taken our settings for us. We know that we're in the correct setting and that is ready to export out for instagram So it's now square formatted. So in this case what we'd have is black top and bottom Which brings us nicely onto tip number nine, which is about blanking So how do we know this clip has now been made into instagram format? But we can't really see the shape of it because we've got black and black here and our viewer is generally set to black So what we can do is go to our user preferences Click on user and say use gray background in viewers and what this does Is make those gray and now I can see really clearly what the output for instagram is going to look like This is also useful not just for instagram. So if I go back to the cup page and let's put this back into hd And go back to our deliver page And let's just make that fit so we can now see very clearly at the top and bottom that we're clean What sometimes happens is if you've zoomed out and done a pan and scan on your image You sometimes get a little bit of blanking. So if I go to my color page let's say we just Zoomed a bit and we had that going on if you go to the deliver page You can now see that you've got a little bit of blanking showing in the top This is also good for guide for if you're putting on 235 look or something like that. So if we go to timeline go to output blanking and let's put a 235 on there Go to my deliver page You can see it nice and clearly what's going on there because we've got the gray viewers And that gray viewer applies to the color page as well So particularly if you're working on a laptop you can see exactly what you're working with and spot any blanking issues So finally tip number 10 is smart filters. So when I'm grading I'll often come across a shot And I might need to do something a bit more complex that I don't want to do at that time For example object removal. I might want to just do that a bit later. So what I do is flag the shot so I just go right and click on it flags and add a colored flag And then what I'm going to do is when I'm in the delivery page just before I render out I want to check that I've not got any flags that I've not completed the work on So if we go up to clips a bit like we did with the ungraded clips earlier but you can come down here and say flag clips And look for shots with any flags. So I've got three flag shots And what I try to do is remember to take the flags off once I've completed the work So if I've done a bit of object removal, I'll take the flag off and then there's none left But in this case, I've got three flags still on so I need to go back into the color page to address those And if you see up here underneath the word clips there's a red line and that's telling us that we're in a filtered state So we're currently in flagged clips So if we go to all clips that deletes the filter So you now see there's no red line and just be careful here that you use the pull down menu here and not Clicking on the word clips because if you do your clips disappear. So you need to press that again to bring them back Uh, so finally there's a little thing down here called smart filter. You can create your own parameters So have a look at all these there's tons of stuff you can use metadata Uh, so because I color timeline properties of graded clips is true adding some metadata Uh, could be a certain camera You could say maybe all shots that have got uh, open effects on them Is false so show all the clips without open effects on and just create yourself a smart filter there And then if you click up here You'll see that smart filter is added and you can delete them or rename them in this section here So I hope you found those deliver tips useful.
