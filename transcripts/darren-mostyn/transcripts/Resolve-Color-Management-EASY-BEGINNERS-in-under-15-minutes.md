Hi, my name is Darren Mostyn and in this episode I'm going to try and attempt the impossible. I'm going to try and explain Resolve's color management in under 10 minutes. There are quite a few videos out there that explain it but they're all quite long and this is just a real cut down version of how to use color management if you don't know what to do. So a few of my videos recently I've kind of started doing some color grading and the first thing I have to say is that if you don't understand color management then don't worry about it. I'm going to address that in this episode. So I'm going to show you what color management is and by the end of it you should get a basic understanding of how to use Resolve's color management because it's really good. So this is not for advanced users so if you know how to use Resolve's color management you really do not want to be watching this video. So let's crack on. So basically I've got a project here and I've got several shots in here. I've got some red raw footage. I've got some black magic raw. I've got a bit of Canon and I've got an Apple ProRes quad 4 clip here. So they've all got different camera profiles. And you can see that this shot here for example is very flat because it's shot in red color space and it's basically log and it needs to be much more contrasty and better looking. Now the monitor that we're working with here is set to Rec709 Gamma 2.4 and if you don't understand that that basically is HD regular standard dynamic range tele. When I'm grading for broadcast that's the spec I'm working to. So the first thing we need to do is go to our project settings and I'm just going to work in regular DaVinci YRGB. This is non color managed to start with. Okay. And I set my timeline color space to be Rec709 Gamma 2.4 because that's correct for broadcast television. Sorry not Rec2020, Rec709 Gamma 2.4. There we go. And I'm going to press save. Nothing's going to happen because I haven't done anything to the clip yet. And all I've got to do now to get that into a much better looking image is I'll probably adjust my offset a bit, bring down my lift and gain, add some saturation, bit of contrast, that sort of thing. And that is now looking much better. That is looking like how I expected to look on my Rec709 display. So this is known as display referred color grading. Okay. I'm using my display to get me into a good place. Now using color management you can do that much more accurately because when the camera was shooting this scene it has a certain profile that can be used to get it into Rec709 Gamma 2.4 without me guessing where the controls need to go. So what I'm going to do is reset that. So we're back to our original image, ungraded. And I'm now going to put us into a color managed workflow. So I'm going to click down here, project settings, and I'm going to change my color science to be DaVinci YGB color managed. So it's the same color science, it's just color managed this time. There are two other ones here as well. You've got ACCC and ACCCT. ACIS is a color managed system but it's a different type of system and that is unified across a lot of different platforms. So you could do ACIS in baselight, ACIS on flame for example. So it's more of an industry standard. But we're going to look today at DaVinci YGB color managed which is its own color management system and it works really well. So I'm going to switch into DaVinci YGB color managed and it then says what do you want to process. So we want to process in SDR, standard dynamic range. We're not doing HDR just yet. And the output color space is going to be SDR Rec 709 which is correct for this project. So my display is Rec 709. That's where I want my output to be. I'm going to press save and when I do, watch what happens to this image. It's automatically now gone into the correct settings for my Rec 709 Gamma 2.4 display. So the color management has transformed it from red color space into Rec 709 display space. So it's scene referred is red and its display referred is Rec 709 Gamma 2.4. So I'm just going to say Rec 709 from now on because it's always going to be Gamma 2.4. Alright now that looks a lot better than what I did manually because there's some science doing that. Now the advantage of that is if you're using different camera formats by using color management to get to your first step, this is kind of your first step of grading. This is just to get the balance into Rec 709. Allows me to balance different camera formats. So a Sony for example will shoot a very different scene referred color if you like than red will and then black magic will. So by using color management you are automatically using the camera profiles and the camera manufacturers science to get into a good Rec 709 starting point. So it basically means your starting point is great. Alright I hope that makes sense. Now what you might have noticed is that it just literally jumped into a nice looking image. It's now looking great in Rec 709. If we look at our waveform here you see that we've got nice settings in there and we can now go add another node and just start making our fine tune adjustment so we might want to cool this off a little bit. We might want to put some shapes around it. We basically can perform our grade but we've got a great starting point. So I'm just going to get rid of that node. Now how did it get to there? Well what it's done is it's recognized that this is red. So the clip has metadata attached to it and if we go to our camera profile here it sets the project setting so it recognizes this is shot red wide gamma RGB log 3G10 which is one of the red profiles. So it automatically knows where to take it from its scene referred mode into the correct display referred mode and the display referred mode is coming from our settings here. Okay, SDR Rec 709. So that is how it knows what to do. Now if I look at these next clips these are all already graded. So within one switch we've now graded all of these 10 shots. So if we go to black magic it now recognizes that this is black magic design. So it goes from the black magic design scene referred color space into Rec 709. It's just transforming it. All right, we've got a good base grade on all of these. This one's Canon so it recognizes Canon Cinema Gamut and this one is ProRes. Now the ProRes one hasn't had a profile attached to it and that's because ProRes doesn't contain any camera metadata. So we have to manually tell the color management system what this was shot with. All right, now this was shot with Arri. Okay, so if I just move through that clip all I've got to do is then right hand click on the clip and because we're in a color managed workflow you get a new menu. This isn't on there if you're not in color managed. I go input color space and I can set this. I know this was shot on Arri. Now you do have to know what it was shot on. There's no shortcut for that. This is shot Arri log C and there we go. That looks great already. That's now in a much better state than it was but because it's ProRes I have to tell it. Okay, so if it's raw it's automatic. In fact in the raw settings you don't even have input color space. All right, because it's switched in here. I've now got input color space. I can change it to be black magic design, rec 799, red, whatever it is. So this is quite a simple setup because we've only got 10 shots. So what if you're working on a long form program you've got maybe 700, 800 shots and you need to assign the correct color space for them. What you can do is take your clips, obviously the raw ones are adjusted automatically but you can take any other clips that you've got and in the media management you could group them together. So you might group them by resolution for example so all your Arri clips will be the same resolution. By clip name would even be a good way of doing it and you can group them all together and then you can globally change the input color space like so. And then they're all correctly set in the timeline. So the next important thing is to know the order of operations. You need to understand how the color management actually works and where it's processed in the order because we're not working with nodes anymore. The color space transform is just happening. This is by some miracle converting from red color space into rec 799 color space. And that's happening under the hood in the color management. But where does it happen? Does it happen before the edit page, before the fusion page, after the color page? How does it all happen? Well, there's several things happening. First thing that's processed is the raw. So if it's a raw clip this is taken into account first. All these settings, your ISO settings, everything here is analyzed and processed first. Then the next mode of operation is what's called the IDT. It's the input device transform. Then your color grade happens and everything in the edit page, everything you do with edit effects, fusion color page effects are all then processed. And the final stage of it is what's called the ODT is the output device transform, which in this case is rec 799 gamma 2.4. Now the beauty of this is all the processing is being done in a large color space. It's being done in a huge big red color space here or black magic raw color space, Canon color space, Arri log C color space. These are all massive color spaces and you can see those on this graph. You've probably seen this before, but there's DaVinci wide gamut, for example. It's much, much larger than rec 709. So where can we adjust our IDT and ODT? And if you don't understand this bit, don't worry too much because the beauty of DaVinci Resolve Color Management for beginners is you can literally go processing mode, standard dynamic range, output color space, rec 709. And it deals with everything for you. So if we just read this SDR grading environment, best used when the majority of source material is SDR suitable for SDR and HDR deliverables. So you can switch your output color space into HDR very easily. The advantage of that is you don't have to regrade everything. You literally just transform into a different output color space. So the reason we're not seeing many options here is because automatic color management is on. So I'm just going to switch this off. And we now, if we go down here, you see we've got lots of different options now. So we start getting to HDR world, P3 cinema mode and all this sort of stuff. So effectively DaVinci Resolve is doing the hard work for us. In this episode, I'm not going to take this much beyond that. But what I want you to understand is that it's not a node based operation. It's happening. The color processing, the color science is being done before you make any adjustments in the color page. And then this display output is being set after we've done all the work. So we're always working in the largest color space possible, which is the best case scenario. You want to be working in the largest space you can. Now you might have seen me doing what's called color space transform on a node. And I'm just going to show you what that is doing. So what I'm going to do is come out of color management. So I'm going to take my color management off. I'm going to go back to DaVinci YRGB. And this effectively switches our color management off. So all I'm doing now is saying my timeline color space is going to be Rick79, gamma 2.4 and press save. All the images go flat again because we're not color managing them. And I've now got to manually put them in the correct color space. However, what I can do is I've normally had a bigger node tree than this, but let's just put four nodes down, for example. All right. And I'm going to take out of my effects, I'm going to take this thing called color space transform. And what this lets me do is exactly the same as what we've just been doing in the color management, but on a node based level. So I'm controlling where it is in the pipeline. So I'm going to take this effect here. This is red footage. All right. So my input color space is red. So I'm going to scroll down here. It's red, white, gamma RGB. The disadvantage of this is you do need to know what it is. Okay. Because obviously the raw is now not being automatically applied. The raw metadata. The input gamma is log 3G10. Okay. And my output color space has used timeline, which is currently set to Rec.709, gamma 2.4. It's quite good practice to just switch this anyway, just so you really know what you're doing. Gamma 2.4. And you see the tone mapping here is set to DaVinci. Now it's a good idea to leave it at that because what it's doing is saying I'm going to use DaVinci's wide gamma. That's this huge color space here. And I'm going to neatly map everything down to my output device transform, my output gamma, my output color space, which is Rec.709, gamma 2.4. So everything, nothing sort of clips hard. And by doing this, that is exactly the same as doing the color management. In fact, I'll show you what I'm going to do is grab this as a still. Okay. So it's there. I'm going to delete that note. So we've got absolutely nothing going on. I'm going to go straight back into DaVinci YGB Color Managed. So I'm going for color processing, SDR, output color space, SDR, Rec.709. Press save. It automatically does the work for me. And if I now wipe this clip, you'll see there's the clip underneath it. If I click on this one, you'll see that there's no difference at all. And just to check, let's just check the waveform. There's absolutely no difference at all. So that's exactly the same. So if I now go back to my regular DaVinci YGB, so effectively I'm color managing and apply that node. There you go. There it is there. I'm effectively color managing, but at a node base level. And this is better than me doing this sort of stuff in here and just guessing where the contrast needs to be and where the midpoint needs to be, the mid-grade point, all that sort of stuff. So I'm going to reset that again. Now you'll also notice I've got nodes sitting underneath that. And that's because I want to grade underneath this node. On my fixed node tree, I have a couple of nodes after that in case I just want to do anything after. But certainly when you're beginning, you should really have that at the end. So if you're just starting out with a color management, I would recommend that you probably don't go this route, the color space transform route. I would go, I'm just going to reset that, I would go for regular DaVinci YGB color managed, reset my output to 709 if that's what your output color space is. Save that and then you've got yourself a great starting point and all your cameras will be nicely balanced. So I hope that's helped demystify the resolve color management. I'm not convinced I did that in under 10 minutes, but I think it's shorter than a lot of the videos that were out there. Check out if you want to see more in-depth stuff on this. I might do a follow up to this if people want it and go into a little bit more advanced because obviously we're just touching the surface here. But you should check out Cullen Kelly, have a look at Cullen Kelly's YouTube channel. He is an absolute wizard at color space transforms, color management, aces, all that sort of stuff and that's a fantastic resource. So look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
