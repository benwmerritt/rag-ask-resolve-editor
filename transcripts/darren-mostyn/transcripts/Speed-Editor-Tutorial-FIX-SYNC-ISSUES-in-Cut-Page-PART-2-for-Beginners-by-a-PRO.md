So in part one we looked at the speed editor and the cut page in real detail, but in this episode we're going to particularly focus on the sync bin and I'm going to show you some issues that I've had with syncing in there and how to fix them and we're also going to look at multi-cam editing. So let's go and take a look. So we've seen the sync bin working when we've got two cameras on an interview and you see how effectively that works and how easy it is to switch between two cameras. But what happens when we've got a lot more cameras? So let's import this one, it's called Jitterbug Riot. This is a nine-camera music video shoot and we're going to go into the cut page, I've now imported that and what I'm going to do is sync these up using the same technique as we did before, but this time this track here is the actual audio master track so we're not going to include that in our initial sync. So I'm going to highlight these nine camera angles, I'm going to hit this button here so I'll sync then and here is our nine cameras. So what I'm going to do is highlight the audio mix so each of these tracks has an audio file attached to it so it's just the camera top mic, press sync and it's going to analyze that and sync all those nine camera angles up for us. There we go, so I'm going to press save sync and you get this icon here meaning they are active in the sync bin mode which is this button here. Now the next thing I need to do is put, when you're working with multi-cam in the sync bin you need to put one of the tracks down on a timeline so I'm going to create a new timeline, I'm just going to right click here say new timeline. I'm going to use the current project settings because I set to 24p, if this was a different frame rate you can deselect that here, go to your format and choose whatever frame rate you want so you can now mix timeline frame rates. I'm happy with the project settings and I'm going to say j up and create. I'm going to highlight that, take off my video only and press append so that's now brought that in with the wild audio track that's going on. So as you can hear that's really poor quality so let's get in the actual main audio mix that we've got. So the easiest way to do that is actually go into the edit page and what I'm going to do is literally take this, drag and drop it down anywhere I like on the timeline and I'm going to utilize the auto-align function so I'm going to highlight all these, right click say auto-align clips based on waveform. So I'm going to analyze that and it's going to line those up for me so let's press play. So that's great all I need to do now is unlink the selection here, remove that audio track and now we've got a clean audio mix. So back to our cut page, so let's go and trim off the front so I'm just going to go into my trim in. In fact I can see the waveform down here is showing me exactly where I need to start so I'm going to trim in all the way up to there. So now if I go into my sync bin we've now got all the nine camera angles at our disposal so we can start off, let's start off with the drummer there. So camera seven, just hit camera seven and I'm going to say source overwrite and what that's done is put a five second click down at the drummer. Now what I did do was bring it down with the audio so what I'm going to do is undo that, double click, I'm going to deselect, what happens when I'm playing these nine camera angles, watch this. You hear all of these top mics at the same time which is really annoying when you're trying to have a look at what camera you want. So the best way to get around that, video only and now you hear the timeline playing back so it's much much nicer to work with. So let's scroll back to the beginning, I'm actually going to start the drummer I think. So I'm going to press camera seven and source overwrite. Hit my timeline so you don't see my nine cameras now you'll see the main program. Right at that point there let's go to another shot so I'm going to press sync bin, let's go to camera three and again source overwrite or place on top even will work. Let's go to a wide at this point so I'm going to get to my sync bin and let's choose camera, let's go to camera nine and source overwrite. Close up with the guitarist at this point I'm going to do this in a different technique I'm going to use sync bin and I want the guitarist here so it's camera eight so I'm going to press camera eight, keep my finger pressed on it and literally turn my jog shot play and literally paints it onto the timeline so this is a really cool way of doing it. Press my timeline so we can let's see what we've got so far. Okay so it's a little bit late on the guitar stab so what I want to do is trim that back a little bit so I'm going to go to trim it in just trim it back a little bit. So it's really quick and simple if you want you can in the live overwrite mode you can actually go forward a little bit if I press live overwrite every time you double click it will randomly pick a camera angle and drop it down onto the timeline in a random duration so double click double click double click double click so it's just put down a few camera angles for me let's have a look at that. You get a general idea so I don't generally work in the random mode but I just want to show you what all these buttons do so we're in video only choose the camera angle you want either paint it on with the jog shuttle or source overwrite so that's the sync bin now I want to show you now is you can fall into a bit of a problem when you're trying to sync up your clips so I just want to show you a problem that I had on a real project and show you how I got around it so I'm just going to change project what I've got here is four clips so this is a cooking reel that we're doing and I've basically got here this is a Canon C300 this is a Canon C200 this is a Sony a7s III and the bottom one here is the overhead it's a GoPro and these are all in 4k okay so we're running ultra HD so what I've done is created proxies for these so I can play them back easier I've left one off just so I can show you quickly how to do that I've got my proxy header here so that's not on by default so you need to right click on the top here and select proxy and that shows me whether I've got a proxy file or not so I'm just going to generate a new one I'm going to right click on the file that I want to make a proxy fit of hit generate proxy media and that will now go off and create a proxy file to the dimensions that I've set it to in the project settings which is currently set to half resolution pro res 422 okay so once that's generated it populates this column here so I can see now that all four of these clips have got a proxy file attached to them the other thing I want to do is take this camera angle here again I've added this column myself and when you use the sync bin you can determine a camera number for each camera now the reason you do that mainly is a I want to use it to get the correct order so I actually want camera one to be this one not this one so let's just go in there I'm just going to literally type one and I'm going to put a camera two here and this one's camera three and this one's camera four now the other advantage of doing this is that if you have let's say for example the Sony a7s 3 camera this one had while the while the thing was being recorded if someone was pressing pause in between and the other cameras weren't on pause this Sony a7s 3 may have like five or six different files attached to it and by default when you go to the sync bin it's going to think that they are different camera angles so it's going to put them into camera six camera seven camera eight camera nine when actually they all belong to camera three so if you've multiple shots that belong to one camera you can group them here by putting a camera number on them and that way they will stay with the correct camera number when you're doing your switching so let's go to the cut page and I'm going to make sure the first thing I do is sort by camera so now I've got camera one camera two camera three and camera four as I specified in the media pool all right so let's go and sync and there's going to be a problem with this so I'm going to sync here and again we're going to sync by audio so each of these clips has an audio track on it and we're going to say sync so we've got an auto sync failed and it's failed on camera two and the reason it's failed is because the audio is actually sat on tracks three and four and resolve needs it to be on tracks one and two to perform the auto sync so it took me a while to work that out but I'm going to show you how to fix that so let's say okay to that it's then going to sync up the three cameras that it can work with because the audio is on a one and two on these three cameras this camera here the camera two in order to sync it up manually which is what I'm going to do I'm going to have to select the camera angle here I'm going to take off the sync lock and I'm just going to manually align it okay and what we've got here is if we look at our angles we've got our clap okay so we can see here that camera one and camera three are lined up and camera two isn't so here is our clap mark and we need to line it up here okay so what I'm going to do is just nudge it using my comma and full stop and we're nudging that in now that is accurate as far as I can tell so it looks like it's accurate but it's actually out so what I'm going to do is I'm going to fine-tune this I'm going to save the sync I'm going to fine-tune this in the edit page it's a little bit easier to work in so let's go to the edit page let's now what you get is this icon that tells me that it's made a sync this is my sync bin okay so I'm going to actually put that into my source viewer I'm going to go to timeline and we're going to swap timeline and source viewer so what that does is put all of my source here on a timeline v2 is unlocked because I've unlocked it in the in the sync bin I'm going to highlight that I'm going to make sure that I'm linked here I'm going to highlight track two I'm going to zoom in to my sync and you can see here this is where I need to align okay so let's just back that up so moving at a frame at a time and something like that let's zoom right in and we're not quite there so I'm going to go one frame forward and one frame forward one frame back doesn't actually line me up properly you can see that here we're not actually perfectly aligned and a good little trick here if you want to adjust the audio you can do that at a tenth of a frame at a time so if you press option alt and in left and right arrow keys you can literally move the audio a tenth of a frame so we line that up absolutely perfectly okay once I'm happy with that let's just swap that back go back to my cut page and now what we can do is put down our main track which is camera one let's click on that let's press append that's in my timeline I'm going to go to my sync bin they are all now aligned I'm going to get to my camera two I'm going to say source over right let's have a look take camera two off go back one frame there we go we're perfectly lined up so I could have fixed that before I go into the sync mode which would have made life a little bit easier all I'd have to do is go to the media page right hand click on the clip that's got the audio on the wrong channels go to clip attributes and what I could do then is assign channel three to be audio track one and channel four to be audio track two and then I can actually delete these two if I want and then that way it would sync automatically because the audio is now assigned to tracks one and two so I hope that's showing you how efficient this speed editor is with the cut page think about the source tape and smart insert things like that the sync bins these are tools that are really going to get you editing super quick in your timeline if you've enjoyed this think about subscribing and look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode
