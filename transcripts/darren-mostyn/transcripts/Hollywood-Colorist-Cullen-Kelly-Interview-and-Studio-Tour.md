So I'm at Cullen Kelly's house for a good ol' geek out. Kelly. I should have known I'd be alive one day. What's up buddy? Say hello. Hey everybody. It's Cullen Kelly in the flesh. We're here. Where did Kelly go? Get it to your place. I'm actually at Cullen Kelly's house. Cullen, great to meet you last. Finally in person buddy. I'm looking forward to a little tour of the studio. Yeah. See the kit that you actually use. Absolutely. It's nice to see you in person instead of just on YouTube. Yeah. Did you think I existed? I wasn't sure you did. Yeah exactly. We're real people. And no surprises. You look just as beautiful as you do on YouTube. Clean living in a pure heart. Exactly. That's a bit more about you than what you do because I just know you as someone who's just got this massive load of information about how the visual result works. But I'm sure there's something else in there. Well you'll be surprised to hear that when I'm not talking about color grading and image science on YouTube, I'm just doing color grading and image science. It's my whole world. When I'm not doing my YouTube stuff, I'm a senior colorist. I'm an image scientist and developer, all that fun stuff. So I'm just living and breathing color. Great. And things good at the minute? What sort of things you've been working on? Yeah, things are going great. I get to work on lots of different projects. I tend to do four to five jobs a week that range from long form to short form, commercials, documentaries, kind of the whole range of things. Great. Yeah, it's great. Cool. Okay, so talk us about your sense of it. I know you just moved house. Yes. And you just had a baby. Yeah, so not much going on. So I'm not going to show you too much what's going on over there. Here, it's all looking very nice. It's working right here. This frame is great. So there's not going to be much B-roll in this one. But let's talk us through your main weapons. Yeah, so I keep things really simple in terms of my actual physical setup here. I've got my iMac Pro over here that is, I guess, in computer terms getting a little older, but it does its job really great. I guess the iMac's what's all spec, that is. Yeah, and to be honest, as much as I know about color science and all that stuff, I'm kind of a knucklehead when it comes to hardware. If it works, I run it and when it doesn't, I ask someone to suggest a new machine and I buy it. So you're looking at maybe something like the Mac Studio? Yeah, I think the Mac Studio is interesting. I'm sort of waiting for the dust to settle. Yeah, I've not seen much out there yet on it. So I'm going to go to NAB, so I'm going to check out if anyone's been actually running it properly because I'd be interested to see what happens when it's not dedicated GPUs to actually having those performed. I'm going to look to you for whether or not it should go on and on until we know. Okay, so that's the heart of it, I guess. Yeah, so that's the iMac Pro. I'm just running that for the actual machine. I've got my LG 32EP950, which I think I'm getting right over here for my reference monitor. It works great for SDR in a pinch for getting a quick preview of an HDR. It's great. You obviously can't master HDR on it, but it's a great client preview monitor for that purpose. What is going to look at that? Yeah, exactly. And then over here to my left, I've got my big LG client monitor that I've calibrated. So that's kind of my setup here in the room. And then other hardware-wise, I've got my mini panel down here. I really like the mini panel. It's a good form factor for like, there wouldn't be any room for the advanced panel on this desk. This has most of the controls that I need. I got to get a stream deck. We were talking about that last night. I just need to round out my kit with that. That really does complement it well. I think to the point, a couple of stream decks even, and that you will on your way to half an advanced panel. Yes, that seems to be the consensus there. But obviously, you've chosen this desk. I guess this is because it's a setup stand. Yeah, it goes up and down. I can roll it around. And I do like having a pretty simple minimal, like actual physical setup for myself. And I do a lot of my grading actually with my PENT, with my Wacom tablet as opposed to any control surface. I love my PENT. Yeah, I know you're a PENT. I've been 15, 20 years I think with that. That's why I work for a FAT. I'm actually holding Cullen Kelly's Wacom pen. This is like the holding grower. It puts you in your happy place as soon as you're holding it. I feel soothed already. It's like a pacifier. Good energy coming through the pen. Yeah, so lots of work happens with that pen. And then maybe the newest upgrade for me that only happened recently is I've got my iPad over here that I just use as this little sidecar thing that MacOS does. It works great. Do that dual screen thing and resolve. And I can throw all my gallery stills down there, especially for long form when I've got lots of them that I need to be thumbing through. It's just easier to have it dedicated. A little bit of real estate for that. And scope on it maybe or more stills? Yeah, more stills over there. I kind of leave it dedicated for that. And then I do scopes here on the big monitor and seem to kind of find a home for everything with that configuration. Okay, good little setup. That's it, man. What's that thing called? Storage wise? Storage wise, simple as well. I've got an SSD RAID that isn't huge in capacity. I keep only active jobs on there and then like archive stuff off as soon as it's been delivered. And it worked great for me. Really fast read and writes and does everything that it needs to. And that's kind of the one stop solution for that. So try to keep it really simple and really, you know, like I'm running my own company here. So I don't have a dedicated engineer, IT person. So the simpler and more reliable I can keep things the more time I can spend rating and making stuff. Makes sense. So I know you do and you've got a whole plethora of plugins and stuff that you've done yourself. So I presume you're not using other people's plugins or anything. I tend to make my own. You've got to trust your own. If you're not using them then. If I'm not using them, yeah, you're probably not going to want to. Do you want to tell us a bit about how that's developed or when, you know, what's your favorite ones or? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So I mean, like, you know, my, in general, my, my quip is that I love to make things as in color grading, but I also love to make things that make things as in color grading tools. So I spent a lot of time doing that. And I've got my colloid plugins that are kind of the on the more high end side of things. But what I'm probably most excited about right now are my elements lots that came out earlier this year that get a little bit that get a lot of the functionality and like the beauty of those colloid plugins at a much more reasonable, like a much better and initial kind of price point. Yeah. And they're variable and you can kind of mix and match them and create your own looks with them. So I'm really fired up about those and they're, they're modular and simple and they just work and make great looks. Fantastic. Yeah, I've played with a few of them and they are like, just really what's easiest you've done all the hard work. All I've got to do is tweak it. Yep. And you can trust them. They're only going to do nice things to your picture. They won't do ugly things to your picture. And then you can just create underneath. Cool. Well, we had a really good night last night. So thanks for, you know, that was, you want to be a flower on that one. So thank you very much. Thanks buddy. In Costco trying to find the tripod and we might have to settle for some bug repellents and almonds. This is not going to be successful. Hey, what's up buddy? Good to see you. But if you can see that on the camera, probably not. I don't know. Anyone does that. I didn't realize that when you do these, you normally go out for about four hours. Yeah. No, I'm primed and pumped and ready to go. Yeah, right. Okay, let's not miss out on the battery. Oh, it's been recording all that time. So Lucy, I'm at In-N-Out Burger just for you. And then we've also got some good updates about my course that's coming up. Sort of like intro level color scores that we're going to be teaching back in gym. Color mine. I'm shooting mine. It's about to be shot. Buddy, I'm trying to do a show here. It's coming up. Yeah, who's here? I'm just going to meet you something. Yeah, Jim's here. Hi Jim. Hi, Jim. Hey, Jim. Hi Jim. Hi Jim. Hi Jim. Look at yourselves. Good to see you brother. Talk soon. Bye. Bye, Tom.
