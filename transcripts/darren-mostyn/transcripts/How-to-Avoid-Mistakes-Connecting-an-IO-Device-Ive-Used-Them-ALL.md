So in this episode I'm going to share to set up one of these. I'm going to teach you how to avoid common mistakes that people make when they try and connect devices like this to their computer. This is the Black Magic Design Ultra Studio 4K Mini. This works fantastically with DaVinci Resolve and I've done a complete episode where I show you the advantages of using an I-O box or a card with DaVinci Resolve to get you the best quality possible and I'll put a link to that in the description below. That video also covers some of the other options available. This is just one of the few devices that work with DaVinci Resolve and depending on the size of box or card you get you get different connections. So if you look on the back here I've got various connections going on. So I'm going to show you in this video how to set this up. So if you do decide to use an I-O device you don't have to with DaVinci Resolve you can just use it software only but if you do use an I-O device it has to be from Black Magic Design. You can't use a product from say Ager or Matrox. It's got to be a Black Magic Design product. However these work not only with DaVinci Resolve but they work with Avid, Final Cut Pro, Premiere, After Effects, tons and tons of different software so it's not just restricted to DaVinci Resolve. So to connect these to your computer you've got two options. You've either got a PCI Express card that sits inside your computer and then all the video connections and audio connections are actually on the card itself. So if using a box which is the UltraStudio range then they connect by Thunderbolt 3. Now you can't use a USB-C cable it has to be Thunderbolt 3 or Thunderbolt 2 within a data but that is what you need. Now as I've got one here this is a Thunderbolt 3 cable I'm just going to connect that in that goes that end and that end goes to your computer and that's it the box is connected obviously you need to power it up. So that's how to connect it to the computer then what you need to do is connect your video and audio. So I've got here HDMI cable so this would be if I want to monitor on a HDMI monitor I would plug my HDMI out here and this end would go to the monitor and that's it that's going to allow me to view true video signal via HDMI on my external monitor. Now use good quality cables this is gold plated so try and use good quality cables where you can and make sure that they're capable of delivering 4k if you want to work in 4k. Now the gradient monitor I've got here runs on SDI it's a serial digital interface so I've got an SDI cable here that would go to the SDI output and then the other end would just connect to my monitor and then I've got HDMI and SDI out so you can have multiple connections connected at all times and you literally just switch in the software which one you want to use. Now one thing to be aware with Thunderbolt 3 is it's restricted to 2 meters they only come in lengths of up to 2 meters so if you want to go longer than that you're going to need to look at fiber optic options. Now there's a company called Corning who make fiber optic Thunderbolt 3 cables and they run in lengths like crazy lengths I don't know what they go to like 50 meters or something. So in the studio here I'm running a 5 meter fiber optic Thunderbolt 3 cable from my Mac which is down below me here to my UltraStudio 4k Extreme which is at the back here you can just see that in the back. If you're on a PCI Express card you're just going to run those cables that have just connected to the box but directly into the card. Now these IO devices whether it's a card or a breakout box need a driver and it's the same driver whether you've got a card or a box whichever box you've got it's the same driver running all of them and the reason you need a dedicated driver is because these work with other products they don't just work with DaVinci Resolve so it's not enough to just install DaVinci Resolve on your computer and expect the box to work you need to download the driver. So I'm going to show you how to do that the products called desktop video is a Blackmagic Design product so let's have a look and I'm going to go to blackmagicdesign.com and if you go to support and then click on capture and playback down here you'll see desktop video and the latest one today is 12.2.3 that's for the Mac and if you're running on Windows you've got 12.2.2 this one is a Mac dedicated update so download the Windows version here and you're good to go it's free to download and you just literally run that. So on a Mac that will then appear here in your system preferences and on a Windows machine you'll see listed under blackmagicdesign desktop video. So once you've installed the driver as long as you've got a Thunderbolt 3 connection to a box and power of course or you've got your PCI Express card installed then once you load the Blackmagic Design desktop video software it recognizes the box that's attached. Also if you go down here you might have a list of several boxes and devices you might have more than one attached so basically to configure choose the one that you want and then on here video output so for example I've got my own video playback set to display a black output when it's not playing so I'm going to get burning on my screen and then if I come down here you see the SDI output settings are set here so I've got a single link SDI connector so I need to check that some of the older style ones have dual link but I'm only a single link SDI connection on here. So these are just defaults you can change this in the individual software that you're working in so if I want to change resolution for example I can do that inside DaVinci Resolve I can do that inside Premiere I don't have to keep coming to this. On the input side I don't really do much inputting but if you're capturing from a device then you want to set that up here depending which one you want switched. Audio wise again audio input I've got my next LR and down here you can change headphone levels for example audio output levels you can change all those settings here. If you want to do up or down conversion some of the boxes and cards let you do that you can switch in here so you want to do SD to HD conversion. Serial port is connecting to a VTR I haven't done that for many years now and about will give you the software version now I'm on a slightly older driver and the reason for that is I've not upgraded my Mac OS to Monterey yet for several reasons so I'm on 12.1 which is the last version that works on Catalina and that's it on the desktop video side but just be aware you need to install that software that is the driver for your box. So the only other thing to check now is your user settings and your project settings inside DaVinci Resolve so if I press command and comma that will bring up my user preferences and in the software you can do that up here and get to preferences. So what you need to do is look at your system settings and your video and audio I owe and you'll see there that my monitoring device like this is the output of that box is the UltraStudio 4k Xtreme 3 and again you can choose if you've got multiple devices in there you can choose from here. The capture device is set to non because I'm not capturing anything so but I could set that to the UltraStudio you've got audio monitoring delay here so if you've got a slight delay in your audio and video you can adjust that just here and the audio I owe again is coming from desktop video that's the I owe engine that's the software I want the desktop video to control my audio. So let's have a look at the DaVinci Resolve project settings see what we need to change in there so up here we've got our timeline resolution this is in the master settings so timeline resolution is the resolution of my timeline it's the resolution that I'm working at but because I've got an I owe box I can actually monitor in a different resolution and I want to monitor in HD this monitor I've got here is not capable of doing Ultra HD so I'm going to monitor that at 1080p 25 I've got a single link configuration I'm monitoring that at 10 bit full video bit depth what I need to do now is go to my image scaling if I click on image scaling currently it's set to match timeline settings but I'm going to override that and I'm going to say don't match the timeline settings I want to monitor in HD and if I press save on that now my monitor is now monitoring in HD my timeline is playing in Ultra HD now one tip is you can actually set your timeline settings to regular HD while you're working and if you want to output in Ultra HD you can just switch that at the end and then everything rescales any windows and shapes you've done get mapped pixel perfect but basically I can monitor perfectly in HD all the time my timeline is running in 4k obviously I might want my timeline in 4k if I'm doing things like detailed noise reduction or particular fine tuning where I want the timeline processed in Ultra HD now if you're working in HDR there's a couple of other settings that you need to look at first all you need to make sure if you're using HDMI that you're working in 2.0 or above and that your cable is compatible with that and you can check that if you go to the Blackmagic design website go to the product page click on the text spec choose the product that you're working with so after case the Ultra HD 4k extreme 3 click on the text specs and down here HDMI configuration you'll see that it supports deep color and HDR so it needs to save that to give the correct metadata and signals down that HDMI cable to work in true HDR so some of the older products are not actually compatible to that level and then you also need to check this checkbox if I go to my master settings and down here you need to say enable HDR metadata over HDMI so take a look at this video here if you want to see the advantages of using an IO box over just using the software itself look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode
