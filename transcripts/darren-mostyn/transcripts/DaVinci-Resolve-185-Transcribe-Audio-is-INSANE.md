## Transcript
So the Blackmagic Design Development Team have been hard at it again, another new release of DaVinci Resolve and this feature that I want to show you in this episode is absolutely amazing. This is the new Speech to Text tool. This is the last thing that I was using in Adobe Premiere before I cancelled my cloud subscription and I'm just so pleased to see it actually in here. So let's go and take a look. I'll show you exactly how it works. So as you can see, I'm in the edit page. This also works in the cut page and I've got a single clip in here. This is an episode I did a few weeks ago and it's the whole episode. So it's 19 minutes 18 seconds long and all I need to do is right-hand click on the actual clip itself. Get out to the bottom here and you see a new feature called transcribe audio. I'm going to click on this and it's going to go off and literally transcribe the audio. Now I'm doing this on a old trashcan Mac. So it's taking a little while, but I also did the same test on a MacBook Pro M2 and it did that in 1 minute 51 seconds. That's a 19 minute clip in 1 minute 51. So there we go. That's the transcribe done. So that's that full 19 minute video. Everything is in there and I've already checked this through and it is incredibly accurate. So even technical terms, the only thing it got wrong in here was one of the names. So Dario Fissoon. Sorry Dario, that actually got your name wrong and also here it's a DaVinci Master Key and it just spelt it a little bit wrong. But that's the only mistake I can find so far. You'll also see as I highlight that it goes to the correct point in the video as well. So you could use this to find quotes really quickly. So this is super quick is there and if I press my marker, it actually marks the range where it says that exact word. So I could now name this marker. It's going to be really easy for me to navigate through long interviews and I can also use this for subtitling my YouTube videos. So we could take a section here and I can copy that and then we can go and create a subtitle track. In here, right click and say add subtitle and then I can literally just copy that in like we've been able to do before. However, there is a new feature. Now, so there's that in. Let me just move that over a little bit. But there's a new feature in here now that allows me to do automatic subtitling. So what we can do is get rid of that. Let's clear that one off. So if we go up here to timeline and just say create subtitles from audio, it's going to analyze the entire sequence. You can put the characters per line. I think the maximum is 60. Caption presets of subtitle defaults. It even does teletext and Netflix. And we can just say create and that's now going to analyze my entire timeline and create the subtitles for me. And there we go. The whole thing is now subtitled. So let's just play that through. And I can easily edit that as well. So if I just highlight these we can go into track mode and we can change the font or whatever we want to do. Now, the other thing we can do is go back to our transcribe and even if you close this down, it's still there. So if I right and click on the clip again and say transcribe, it doesn't have to go through the process again because it's already done it. So what I can do now is I could click up here and I could actually export this out as a file. And we can also create subclips. If I want to create this little section here as a subclip, if I just click on here, you'll see then I've got a subclip here. I can also, let's go down and find another little section here. So let's say this bit here. Including resizing for social media and all that sort of stuff. I could actually find a place in the edit and I can literally edit this into the program, just that section. So that's edited in perfectly. Let's just undo that because I don't want that to be in there. So the other thing I can do is search for words. So I could search in here. I mentioned Casey Farris in this episode. So let's just find where that is. I'm going to press search and there it is and it's marked it up for me ready to go. You can change the size and all that sort of stuff as well. So this is going to allow me to subtitle my YouTube videos with great accuracy. Now YouTube favors if you subtitle your videos yourself. So I'm going to not let YouTube do it anymore. I'm going to do it like this. And when I've done this in Adobe Premiere, I've had to spend a long time correcting things. So how good is that feature? I was so excited when I saw that. I mean, what else do you need in DaVinci Resolve now? I know it's not a color feature, but to me that is a real time saver. Just for my client work, for transcribing all the interviews. We do a lot of those for my YouTube videos for getting accurate subtitling done. The AI in YouTube is really not very good at doing my videos because there's quite a lot of technical stuff in there. So I'm going to be able to do that really easily in DaVinci Resolve now. So I just want to say a massive thank you to the development team. I mean, they've just smashed it again. Tons more new features. I'm going to get round to showing you the other ones as well. I just wanted to get this one out quick and subscribe, like all that sort of stuff. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
