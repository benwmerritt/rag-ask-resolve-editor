So today is a very exciting day for me. I've taken delivery of the Flanders Scientific XMP310. This is their new reference grading master monitor. Just to say this video is not sponsored I've paid for this with my own money. I spent all day yesterday testing it and we're going to install it so you're going to follow that journey with me. It's a bit of an emotional day as well because I'm saying goodbye to my trusty DM250. I love this monitor. This has been great. I've had it six years now but it's time to move forward. I need 4k monitoring. I want HDR monitoring. I want a slightly bigger form factor so this is a 31 inch. I've got Mark with me who's a DP. I've graded tons of his stuff. Mark's very excited to see this go in as well. Are you excited only Mark? I'm very very excited. You will be when you see it go in. Alright let's do this. So this is the end of the DM250. Very emotional. Now I can't wait to get the other one in. Let's go. Right I'm going to crawl under here. This is not going to look so pretty. There it goes. Good job I only do this cut once every six years. That is now efficiently de-kissed. A book about little people missing. Six years of the little bit. I don't have to film this bit. So now we've got a nice gap here. I'm hoping the 31 inch fits beautifully in there. I'll send it that way round because it's probably better for the colour. To see the front of the bag. If I put it over first. I'm 25 so it's definitely more. Right so now you've got to check the height. So the mains is like this. Strange to connect to thing. It's on quite a big mains board. So I've got a 12G STI cable. I've got a 12G STI cable. Right I've got my STI cable. Let's switch it on. It does need to lift up a bit but that is going to work really well. So please that actually fits. That would have been a nightmare. Right I need something to prop it up with. Let's go to the cover. Boom. See what's in it. I've got so much stuff in here. Not what I need. So I knew it was worth hanging onto these old HD camsapes. These are going to make perfect little risers. That is absolutely perfect. I tell you what that looks great. I am so pleased with that. So I just need a moment with my new monitor. Right let's get the lights out. So I've just spent an extra few minutes just suggesting the height and getting this exactly where I want it. And I can tell you this as a grading experience from here to there. This is a much better experience for me than working on the 25. So I can't wait to get started on this. So let me tell you a little bit about what attracted me to this monitor to start with. It's 31.5 inches which I can't believe how much better that looks than the 25. It is an SDR master grading reference monitor. So all my work is still SDR. So obviously now I can work in Ultra HD and not just HD. So I'm going to be looking at true pixels on there. But it does do HDR of course. It's a thousand nits. So when I need to go to PQ or HLG, HDR grading, Rec 2020, we're good to go on this. It's a Flander scientific. I know it's going to be a great experience because I've had one for six years. So this can only be better. This is Quantum.OLED technology. So you're not going to get any of that haloing that you get with the backlight dimming systems. So I'm really looking forward to testing that out as well. It comes pre-calibrated from the factory. It's got this thing called Gaia AutoCal in there. So I can actually calibrate this myself, not understanding how calibration software works very well because you don't need any software. I don't need a PC or a Mac or anything like that. You just plug a probe straight into the back. So the connectivity on the back is 12G STI. So it's a really simple plug and play straight in. The viewing angle on this is claiming to be 179 degrees, which is a real big feature. So I often have a director sat next to me here. And I can tell you now, even though I've got a little bit of lights going on here, but... I mean, that is impressive. I don't know how we can show that on camera. Maybe we'll get a bit of B-roll of that mark later. But that looks absolutely fantastic. So stick with this episode because after I've had the system for about a week, I do some further testing under proper grading conditions. And if you'd like these sort of reviews, think about subscribing and hit the like button for me. So let's first take a look at this in SDR. So I've got this very simple node tree here. I'm going from Arri. This is the Arri Classic Test Chart, which I know very well. So this gives me a good indicator of how well calibrated this monitor is. And it's looking absolutely fantastic already. But I'm going from Arri LogC4 up to DaVinciWide Gamma back down to Rekse of 9 Gamma 2.4. So we need to make sure that this monitor is set to 2.4. I already know it's calibrated because I've got the calibration chart from the factory. I'm going to go to the menu. The menu is really simple. First thing I'm noticing now that this is in place and I'm quite sure is that these menus are quite far away from me. So the next thing I'm going to do is allocate these to a stream deck. You can put all these function buttons onto a stream deck. So I spent a bit of time yesterday mapping these. So what I'm going to show you is if I just go into here, really quick responsive menus. This is something I really like. I hate it when menus take ages to update. So we're going to go through here. So we go to colour and we're going to go here. So the Gaia colour in here is the inbuilt calibration system on this monitor. It's absolutely fantastic. This is a massive feature for this thing. I don't know how to do calibration properly, but I'm going to be confidently doing it on this monitor. So let's go in and have a look at that menu again. And down here, my EOTFs are set in here. So I can flick between it. I can go to Gamma 2.2 really easily. Just press enter. So if I'm grading for YouTube or whatever I'm doing, I can switch to Gamma 2.2. And I can now change that back to 2.4. Enter in here. I'm at video range, which is what I want to be on. The Gaia colour, colour system by the way, is what the factory calibrated to. So I know I need to be on that one to know that it's been, that's the calibrated colour system that it was calibrated on. Does that make sense? That makes sense. Good. That's as deep as I'm going on it. I've pre-assigned the HDR functions and the SDR functions to the function buttons on here. You've got five function buttons. If I just come off that at the minute, I've got F5 is this really nice sort of false colour display thing that they've got going on. F4 is currently assigned to my vector scope. I've changed it. F3 is my luminance scope. I don't actually need any of this. I've got my Omniscope running side by side here. So I'm going to assign function 3 to the Gamma 2.2. Let me show you how easy that is to do. And again to my menu, I'm going to go to here. I'm going to change that to be Gamma 2.2 and press enter. And then I'm going to go system and I'm going to say profile save. I'm going to call it profile 3 because I've already used one and two. I'm going to go up to my function button and say function 3 enter and that is going to be profile 3. Okay, so now what I can do is use the five function buttons to quickly switch between. This is Rec 79 Gamma 2.4. This is HDR. It's going to look a bit weird at the minute because we're still in SDR on DaVinci Resolve. But if I go to function 3, that is now Rec 79 Gamma 2.2. So I've got 2.2 and I've got 2.4. And look how quick I can change between these. Change in between SDR, different SDR types and HDR is an absolute breeze. The menu structure on Flanders has always been fantastic. So I'm really pleased that that's come across on the XMP310. So I spent years grading in SDR. So I know what the images look like. I know this image so well and I'm telling you that this is definitely calibrated. I know what I'm looking at here. The blacks look gorgeous, all the highlights, all the colors, everything looks exactly as I would expect. But let's have a look at it on a chart here. I know what I'm looking for here on a test chart. This is the SIMT-T chart and I know that I should just be looking for a little bit of lightness in that area there. The whites look fantastic. I'm just going to bring in black. That's black. OK, this is the beauty of OLED, but this is Quantum Dot OLED. And what is also quite amazing here already I'm seeing is the reflection. The reflection I used to get on the DM250 was a little bit annoying. Mainly because not because of that monitor, but because the back of my control surface here is actually silver. This is a big design fault with these advanced panels. The back of it is silver. So we used to reflect off the monitor. I actually used to put a black T-shirt on here. This is a different league of reflection here. I can just about make it out, but probably more because we've got some studio lights on. But this reflect, I'm absolutely blown away by that to be honest. This is the first time I've seen it in better conditions. That is great. I'll probably still put a T-shirt on there anyway. Why not? Or paint it black. People keep saying paint it black. I don't want to paint my advanced panel black. And here is a 10-bit grayscale moving across. And I am just going to check my settings. I'm actually in ultra HD at the minute. Let's bring up an image. So I've got some red footage here. Let me just check that this is going from red to 709. I'm just checking in. So I'm going from DaVinci Wide Gamut down to XM9 Gamut 2.4, which is what I want. And I know this image really well as well. I've used this in my training. This is from Very Kindly Donated To Me by Johnny Finnis. So thanks, Johnny. This is looking fantastic. I've got really good detail in the blacks. I've got good detail in here, but I'm looking forward to seeing this image, particularly in HDR. Because we've got this nice candlelight and things going on. But that is looking great to me. And let's just play around with this. I do a little bit of offset in here. I'll tell you what, viewing this on a 31. I've spent six years on that 25. This is just heaven. Oh, God, this is going to be so good. I'm so excited. Right, calm down. So you monitor. So let's have a look at this image in HDR. I'm very happy with the SDR. I know this is going to be fantastic. Let's switch in to HDR mode. So to do that, first of all, in DaVinci Resolve, I'm going to go into here. I've made some presets in here. So I'm going to go into here and I'm going to go to my 2020 ST2084. So we're going to be working in PQ at 1000 nits. If I just load that preset, obviously this image is going to look a little bit weird now. But just bear with me. What I want to show you is what we're doing here. My video format, Ultra HD 2160p. I'm using 444 SDI. We've got the 12G SDI cable going in. This is the HDMI. This is a fantastic part of the system. It's SDI. Plug it in. It works. I'm on full data level here and my color management is REC 2020 ST24 1000 nits. So it's limited to 1000 nits. The monitor is limited to 1000 nits. All the deliveries for Netflix and all those companies want you limited at 1000 nits anyway. So let's have a look at what it looks like. It's red to 2020. No tree. Everything looks a little bit boring and dull on here. Obviously I'm going to use my function key to switch this into HDR. Watch how quick this happens. Done. So I'm now working in HDR PQ. So we haven't done anything to it yet. So this is looking great. But now we can start pushing things. I've set my waveform to measure in nits. And let's just start pushing this around now. So we're now in HDR. So we can go now. What I've done, I've set a line here at 600 nits. 600 nits is where I don't really want to start pushing beyond. But this is looking absolutely gorgeous. Let's have a look at another image. So I'm going to pick this one's Blackmagic 4K Pocket. And this is currently set to 709. So if I quick look at it in 709, because I can do that nice and quickly. There we go. But let's have a look at it in HDR. So I'm going to change my no tree here. So no grade going on at all. But I've just switched to REC 2020 ST2084. Change my monitor over. And that is looking much better. Look at all this detail we've got coming in. You can't see it on Resolve obviously, because this isn't an HDR monitor. But on here, this is looking absolutely gorgeous. And that's ready to grade. So this monitor's Quantum.OLED technology. So let's just check a star field. We shouldn't be getting any haloing effect going on here. And that is looking absolutely clean to me. I said what I'm going to do, I'm just going to push it a little bit further. Anyway. And it looks amazing. The blacks are blacks and there's no haloing going on here at all. I just want to show you some of the other menus while I'm here. So we've got the function menus here. If I just go... So I've got my function 1, 2, 3. You've got five function buttons on the front here. And if I just enter one, you can see all the different options that you've got. So you've got loom scope, vexoscope, pixel mapping. You've got loom coloring. So this gives you like a false color display. And this is the one that I use on my Omniscope. I've got that set to actually flounders. I have them for years because I love that one. Function 5. There you go. So you get that kind of thing. So it's a really nice way of just seeing where your exposure is sitting. Back to the menu. And you've got area markers, safety markers, and you can load all your different profiles. You just see me do the gamma 2.21. You've got positioning of your scopes. You've got the video input. So moving to the color menu. The color system, dia color. This is the factory calibration setting. This is the factory calibration. But if I go down here, the dia color auto cal system. And it allows me to go into here, press auto cal on. And I can plug a probe into the back. In fact, you can rent a probe from flounders for three days at a time. So really high quality probe. You just rent it. Plug it into the back. And I don't need to use any proprietary software or a Mac or PC connected to it. You literally just plug the probe into the back and it calerates. But it does all the different color settings that you're going to need as well. So do you rec 2020? Do you gamma 2.4, 2.2? Whatever you need is all done in one sitting. This is absolutely fantastic. And if you don't want to do that yourself, you can always send the monitor back to flounders scientific anyway. And they'll calibrate it for free and ship it back to you. That's always been a service that they offer. Technical support with flounders is second to none. I just want to say thank you here to Bram and Simon for the help they give me in the few days while I was testing this. Just had a few setup questions. The technical support is absolutely amazing. Always has been. So I know this has come factory calibrated because I've got the test chart here for this actual specific monitor. And for those who want to geek out on Delta E values, I've got a Delta E value here of 0.2492, which is absolutely ridiculously low. That is a fantastic score. I mean anything under one is amazing anyway, but that's ridiculous. And my gamma EOTF setting is 2.4002. So I'm with 2,000th of a decimal place off 2.4. That's pretty amazing. So the charts there to prove it, but I know what I'm seeing. And the XMP310 also has no fan. So normally when you're working with a grading reference master monitor of this size, you're going to have fan noise going on. This doesn't have a fan in it. That's also going to help with the power consumption. So now the studio set up and I've been using this for quite a few days. I want to run a few tests again. I've got the media lights on the back of the monitor. So this was originally on my DM250. We've got the lights out. We're in proper blackout conditions as I would be working. So this is exactly how I would be grading. So the first thing I want to check is that viewing angle again. We did it last time with a little bit of light on. So I just want to check it again. They're claiming 179 degrees, which is pretty much side on. So I'm looking at this ARI chart. I know this chart really well. This is in Rec. 709. And I can't fault it. I absolutely can't fault it. There's nothing happening at all, even in the corners. The blacks are good. The whites are good. I'm absolutely blown away by that. So I can't fault the viewing angle at all. Let's just try that in HDR just to be sure. So before I go to my next version, I've got the Rec. 2020 ST2084 1000 NIT set up. I'm going to switch this over for my preset in HDR. And just going to check that viewing angle again. And my director would be set probably here. And I 100% can't fault it. I don't know how well this is going to come across on the camera, but that is absolutely fantastic. Now one thing that really took you by surprise when I first installed this was how anti-reflective this monitor is, especially compared to the DM250, which I thought was good. The back of the advanced panel is silver, so it always reflects. I used to have a t-shirt on there. I can't see a single thing reflecting in this. I've even worn a bright shirt today. I normally wear a dark or black shirt or t-shirt to help with reflectivity. I can't see a single thing reflecting in this. It's absolutely amazing. So what I'm going to do, I've got my desk lamp here. This is a media light and it has a D65 white point. And I normally have it on very low in the studio, just so I can read my notes and things like that and just add a little bit of desk light. And I'm just going to shine it in there. I still can't actually see it. So I can just see me reflecting now, and that is with that turned up quite high. So it's taking that level to even get some reflectivity. So it's absolutely amazing. So now under proper grading conditions, I want to test the HDR again. So I've got a couple of clips in here. I've got this one and got this one. But you can see that they've got these light bars going on. So these are going to be great for testing HDR. So at the minute we're looking at this in 709. So let's see what's going on. So we've got these color bars going on here, but there's a lot more color density that we can get out of those if we were in HDR. Let's switch the waveform over to 10-bit for a minute. And we can see we've got a little bit of highlights going on just up here. That's probably from this area here. So let's switch this in to HDR. And I've got a preset on here. So there's a color space transform going from Arilog C3 to Rec 2020 ST2084 1000 nits are in PQ. And there's no grade as such. This is just the camera rushes coming out. So I'm going to press play and have a look at that going on there. Now obviously I can't see it because the monitor is still set to 79. I'm going to switch that over to HDR. And then the whole thing starts coming alive. So look at those light strips now. They're totally full of color. It looks really rich. The specular highlights here look fantastic. I'm going to switch the waveform over to display in nits. So we can see what's going on. We're not quite reaching 1000 nits with these speculars here. I'm going to push it now. Let's just go onto here. Let's go to my HDR tool and just go push my highlights a bit. In fact, we could probably go specular highlights. Push those right up. So we're really getting close to 1000 nits now. I'm going to play this through. So it's just starting to go a little bit down here. Is that because of what I've just done? Yes it is. So let's bring that back again. And then we're going to press play. Oh, that looks absolutely amazing. So much more detail in there. That's fantastic. Let's try that on the other shots here. So similar setup. Again, we're in Rec 79 at the minute. So we're going to switch that to a different version. This is the Rec 2020 ST2084 1000 nits color space transform. And let's just play that through and see what's happening. You can even see here we've got this on air studio lights on here. In Rec 709, that looks really weird. It had like a white inside with a sort of glow around it. It was very weird. That is now really rich and saturated. This looks absolutely fantastic. The detail in the song sheets here is fantastic. Okay, I'm totally pleased with that. I'm going to just play around with a bit of exposure. Let's just see what we can get out of this. This is amazing. Okay, again, I don't know how well that's going to come across on camera, but this is absolutely fantastic. And just at my viewing angle, I mean, it just doesn't change. And there's no reflection. I couldn't be happier. So one thing I did notice with the XMP310 is it takes a long time to actually turn on. So when you switch that button, it takes 13 seconds until you actually see an image. I spoke to Fander Scientific about this and firstly they recommend a 10 minute warm-up period before you start a grading session anyway. So 13 seconds is no big deal, but it's actually designed to prolong the life of the monitor. So all of the menu functionality on the monitor can be controlled over IP. It comes with a bit of software called IP Remote, simple connection via the IP address, and then I've got access to all the functionality via software. I can even control things like the color of the scopes and that sort of thing. And I can assign all this functionality to a stream deck. Now, one thing I noticed with this monitor when I started editing with it is that the audio was ahead of the video. So it seemed out of sync. I'm monitoring my audio through my UltraStudio 4K Extreme coming out of my Genelecs and it transpires that you have to change one of the preferences in DaVinci Resolve. So let me show you what that is. So you go up to here, go to preferences and to accommodate for monitors inadequacies to keep in sync, there is a default monitoring delay of 237 milliseconds. If you set this to zero because this monitor is so amazing and press save, your audio and video will be in perfect sync. So I hope this review has enlightened you how much I'm enjoying the XMP310. Go and check it out at a trade show. You need to see this under proper conditions. I cannot show you how good this is on camera. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode. So all my work here is still standard dynamic range. Otherwise, don't mess with the SPR. So installation was an absolute breeze. We've got it installed because it's an installation. Yeah, so just remember the other things that does. That'd be alright. Up to a thousand nits, 31 and a half inches. We can not remember the rest of the details. 0.2492, that is a phenomenal Delta E value. Not that you should get too obsessed with those, but it's good to know that... Why? Where did I get up to? This is far better than I even thought it was going to be. I'm actually being serious. I just don't have to say it. I'm genuinely chuffed. And obviously in HDR, and obviously now... And obviously now it's HDR as well, so it does a thousand nits. It's quant... It's starting again. UMP310, you... I can't remember what it's called.
