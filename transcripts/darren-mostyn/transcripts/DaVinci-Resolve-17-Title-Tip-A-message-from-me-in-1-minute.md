I just want to say a huge thank you to all my subscribers. I've just hit 5,000 subscribers. I've only had this channel going since the end of June, so I'm so pleased. Thank you all very much. So even though I delivered three episodes yesterday, I'm going to do one more just to say thank you for getting me to 5,000 subscribers. Now Resolve 17 was released yesterday, loads of great new features, but a couple of the little things I've got people talking and it's the little things that really help your workflow sometimes. So I'm going to quickly show you this one in the Edit or Cut page if you go to the Titles, which is in the Effects Library. So if you just hover over the title you want and move left and right, you get a live preview of what it's going to look like. However, if you drop it onto the timeline, let's do this one. So I'm just putting it on the layer above. And what everyone is getting excited about, and it's a really small thing, is the fact that you can now live preview your fonts. So if I go to Montserrat and make that bold, there we go. So look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode. Bye.
