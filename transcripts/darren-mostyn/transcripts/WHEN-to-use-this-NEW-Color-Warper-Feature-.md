So you may be able to tell I'm out in Las Vegas, I'm here for the NAB show, the Blackmagic design team have just announced DaVinci Resolve Public Beta Version 20. Now in there is a fantastic tool called ChromaWarp. I use the ColorWarp all the time and this is an additional element to that tool. I'm going to show you in this episode exactly how to use it in depth and show you just how you're going to get these fantastic results. So let's go and take a look. Just to show you what's going on with color management first I've got this shot here which is AriLoxy4. This is going up to DaVinci Wide Gamut using a CST. You can use regular color management if you want to and then we're back down to 709 here and all the work we're going to do is going to be in DaVinci Wide Gamut on this node here. So let me just change the view so we can see this a little bit clearer. So we've still got the traditional ChromaLuma and our Hue Saturation ColorWarper and how these work is you choose the amount of vectors that you'd like to work in down here so they're lower the number the larger the selection will be. Now the new ChromaWarp you just simply select what you want and move and it's really organically manipulates the color. Let me show you if I change this background here if I want to make that more of a green hue you just pull over here. I'm using this here is the normal mode this one is point to point. This here does isolation this is to select those isolation points so you can delete them if you want and you can really create some fantastic looks and then we've got the ChromaRange and Exposure. So you can see that it's done a really nice job of that. Now let me show you how I would do that on the regular color warper so I'm going to do a new version and I'm going to reset this and what I'm going to do is select the regular color warper I'm going to select that area once again and let's move that now over to the same sort of area and it does a fantastic job as you'll see but let me show you something else. So let's go back to our ChromaWarp version and what you'll notice is you're keeping more of the original colors on this color chart let me show you. So already we're getting a slightly more pleasing result. Now we could go back to our color warper and make some more selections in here and start moving it around but I want to show you another tool. So I'm out in Vegas working very hard getting all the latest news for you. If you like this sort of stuff hit the subscription button for me hit the notification bell and let's get on with this episode. So back to the ChromaWarp let's reset that in fact just to show you before I do that you can make multiple selections as well in here so we could select the foliage here for example and start adding multiple strokes in here okay so you can build this up to really start creating defined looks and then what you can do is increase or decrease the chroma range that's been included right you can see the orange line around there increasing and decreasing. If there was a particular hue that you wanted to protect you can use this isolation tool here and just select it and that takes it out of the range but I'm going to show you another tool now I'm going to reset this and instead of using the normal mode I'm going to click on here and use this one which is called point to point. Now what I'm going to do is take the same idea we're going to take the blue background but this time I want to make it into more a orange range so I'm going to move it over here and what it does is it goes from exactly the selection that we've taken and takes it to our new selection. Now let me show you what would have happened if I'd have done that on the normal tool. We go over and it's including all of this range here now this is including our skin tone clearly so this would be great if you want to do a big color move but what we want to do is a bit more isolated so we could be in here and just start deselecting areas like this but a much more efficient way is to use the point to point editor so we're going to go to click on here go to our new target point and you see that we're retaining so much of the colors in the original color chart here so this is a really great way of doing that let's take a look at how that would work in the regular color warper so you're back to here I'm going to reset this one okay and we're going to do the same thing so it does a great job of it let's click on here and we're going to move it all over to that sort of yellow way over there but look at the color chart we've we're including a lot more information so we'd have to start being very selective about what we're moving here and pulling back but let me show you something else back into full screen mode this is with the color warper the original color warper this is with the chroma warper so you can see it's a much more pleasing look because we're retaining more of the original colors so there's a very slight bit of bleed going on here so let's just come out of that mode let's increase our chroma range and that should tighten that up nicely for us there we go that's all gone so this is going to be a fantastic tool I think a combination of being point-to-point and in the normal mode but isolating selected areas is going to give us a fantastic look now the other thing you can do in here is adjust the exposure so once you're in there we can adjust exposure that's going to help us give that nice sort of dense look if we need to so I'm sure you'll agree the new chrome warp is absolutely fantastic I think a combination of the natural mode and the point-to-point is going to give us some fantastic results look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode
