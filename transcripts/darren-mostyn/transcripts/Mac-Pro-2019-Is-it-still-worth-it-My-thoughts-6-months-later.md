So I've had my Mac Pro 2019 workstation for just over six months now And I thought I'd take this opportunity to make a video about what I really think of it Obviously we've done a lot of work on it now I've done long-form documentary stuff commercials music promos all sorts of stuff so it's had a good Testing in that time just to let you know the spec that I'm working on we got the 3.2 gigahertz 16 core machine It's got 96 gigs of RAM. It's running the Radeon Vega 2 Duo 32 gigabyte graphics card and I've also got the afterburner card in there I picked up this workstation from jigsaw 24 in the UK I've used them for years to be honest. They was giving me such good service the main thing I love about this Mac Pro 2019 is the performance is Unbelievably quick. So let's let's dive in. I'll show you what I mean. So to show the performance of this system I've got in here some 8k materials. This is downloaded from the red website. So I'm just going to show you I've got a clip here. Let me go to the edit page And if I go to metadata up here, you can see this is an 8k R3d file. So it's a red raw 8k file the clip after that is an arry 3.2k file and I'm going to show you the difference between the two in speed and a finally here I've got another 8k file again from the red website. So let's have a look at how fast this Mac Pro 2019 works with these files so 8k raw I'm going to reset that node and First of all play it back. No problem at all. So up here. You'll see the speed frames per second So it's running at 25 quite happily I'll leave that going in a loop and I'm just going to start grading on it and we get instant update It is really powerful. So this is at another node It's a bit of saturation and that's fine. I can put quite a few nodes on here and it will play quite happily But what happens when we start to use AI technology? So inside DaVinci as you know, there is a neural engine So I'm going to do something that's going to push the system a little bit harder and that is the face refinement tool So let's drag and drop that on from our FX library and I'm now going to analyze the face refinement And the speed we're getting from there is pretty phenomenal This is 8k red raw and that is just cruising through that shop now obviously we typically don't work in 8k here, but we do work a lot in 4k and With Ari files, so they are 3.2k. So what I want to do is show you I'm gonna go to the next clip and This clip here. I'm gonna do the same thing. I've already got a couple of little things going on I've got a warper here We've got color space transform and a couple of grades here And I'm just going to throw on the face refinement tool Just so you can see the speed difference when you go from 8k down to more regular files that we would like 3.2k So let me analyze that just because the beginning of the clip which it is and let's go and look at the speed of this now So this is using the DaVinci neural engine, which is the hardest work that this system will have to do So it's really impressive stuff So speeds like that means I can just stop playing with things like face refinement in any of My grades without him to worry that I don't have enough time to do it and just to show you the real power If I move on to the next shot This is 8k red raw and I'm just gonna close down these open effects You can see and look how many nodes I've got going on here So I've got there's about 12 nodes that you can see there I'm just gonna press play and it's gonna play instantly and just to prove that this hasn't been cached beforehand I'm gonna go into here and I'm gonna delete my render cache So it's deleting all of the cash and nothing is pre-rendered and press play and just watch up here the speed That is 25 frames per second instantly With all those nodes going on I've got keying going on windows I've even got in here this thing called color lab that I'm playing with at the minute. This is really brilliant It's a third-party plug-in. It does film stock emulation. So have a look at this You got all this stuff here. So this is a third-party application running and Not only that but in here. I've got a compound node now a compound node allows me to take Many nodes and flatten down into one node So if I decompose that right and click and decompose that node look at all the other stuff I've got here. I've got 18 nodes playing in real time in 8k 25 frames a second so it's Unbelievable power. I've got a glow going on there as well and just to show you something even more impressive by default Black magic design the DaVinci Resolve system itself sets red files to run at half resolution So I'm gonna override that and put it into full res premium resolution 8k raw I'm gonna press play now and that will play at 25 frames per second takes a little a couple of frames to get there But look at that So that is seriously impressive power So a lot of what we get here is 4k so I'm gonna switch over to a 4k file and Here we've got some footage from the Sony FX 6 and this is the actual grade. So I've already graded this up So we've got lift gamma gain here temperature We've got some exposure going on here windows We've got tracking going on there is some color compression There's all sorts of stuff going on here. Obviously this plays in real time. Let's just play that back Just show you that says 23.976 frames per second on this shot and that's playing quite happily So what I'm gonna do is just push the system a little bit harder and add some noise reduction This is where most systems stop working in real time. So I'm gonna put that right at the beginning I'm gonna right and click on here and say Add node at zero before and What I'm gonna do is go to my noise reduction tools So you do need the full version of DaVinci Resolve studio for this and I'm gonna go in and bring that up and One tip here if you're looking for how much noise reduction is put in a shot One thing that can help you if you put your highlight on and switch to AB mode This is going to show you the difference of that node with and without the effects that you're putting on So what I'm gonna do is start increasing luminance and chrominates here in My temporal noise reduction and you can see the outline of what is being affected So what you want to do is push this until you don't see either the products That is the main thing that you're looking at here or a face or that sort of thing So I just want the background here to be noise reduced. I'm just gonna split that Up a little bit push it a little bit harder there. Let's add some spatial noise reduction as well This is what always slows systems down and Let's bring that up a little bit. I'm pushing up too hard now because you can actually see his body coming out there so I'm gonna blend that back a little bit and We'll take that let's have a look at it on the screen and let's play that back and that will give us real time straight away with a bit Look and There we go. We've got real time playback with noise reduction now. That's using the faster noise reduction what I'm gonna do is switch it to be better and better on here and Play that back. So this is now the best noise reduction that we can get and it makes a big difference in performance So let's press play and we're still getting real time So I'm really happy with that. That is an absolute typical no-tree that I would work with in real time So it just means the work I'm doing. I don't have to worry about the system slowing down So one other area that I want to save time in is actually exporting out my project so when we work on long-form programming you're talking about you're rendering out at an hour show or a 90-minute show and You don't want that to take even real time if that took an hour That's that's a long time in broadcast So let's have a look at an example that we've got in here. So if I go to my Shot here, so this is an actual program that we did for ITV last year. It runs at 45 minutes because a one-hour show will run at 45 minutes and Let's take a look in the delivery side of things So if I click in here, here's all our shots and let's just render that out I'll show you the sort of speeds that we get so let's just add that to my render queue So it's a 44 minute program in full quality HD and let's go and render and I'll show you the speeds So that is flying through there and we are rendering this this is estimating to take about five minutes Which is unbelievable. So 45 minute program with the grade on and just so you know by the way, let me just stop that If I go back to the coverage, I have got grades on here so I've got seven nodes running on this one and That is typical of what we would do in a documentary probably five to seven nodes So I'm getting delivery speeds of five minutes for a 45 minute show Means I'm gonna hit my deadlines if we spot something when it's going through and you have to stop and change It's easy. I know the maximum I'm gonna have to wait is five minutes to get a new render One little tip in the render page. This project had about six terabytes attached to it in form of rushes So what I like to do just to help with the archive is if you can see advanced settings here and You can do down here enable flat pass and if you switch that to on you can render out a Completely ungraded version without having to remove your grades. So that gives me a flattened quick time file ungraded that I can park with the archive just in case they need to tweak a shot or add a grade because I can Keep my grades in the project, but I've got then an ungraded master and a graded master. So that's just a good little tip It's just an easy way of doing it. So always on we'll take off your grades and then switch it back to off So when I bought this workstation six months ago, I'm looking at it as a long-term investment I've got 2009 machine set next to it, which is already 11 or 12 years old So I'm expecting a good long life out of this machine and it's fully serviceable I can update the graphics cards if I want to that sort of thing. It is absolutely rock-solid reliable So some of the deadlines that we have to meet on here the last thing I want to do is be rebooting a machine So in the last six months, it's been absolutely rock-solid. We also don't have a machine room here So it is really useful the fact that it's super quiet. You can't hear it. So in fact, it's silent I don't even hear it. I've heard the fans kick in a couple of times I think on some heavy noise reduction jobs, but it is absolutely silent, which is great when I first got the machine when it arrived I noticed on the back It's all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 and we do have a couple of Thunderbolt 2 items I had to buy a couple of little adapters, but it's not really that big a deal So what do I think of the Mac Pro 2019 after six months? It runs like a dream. It looks beautiful and I love it
