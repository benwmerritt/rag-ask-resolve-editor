Honestly, I'm just sick of them not taking me serious. Cheers, everybody! Hi, dear! Welcome to Las Vegas! Look at the size of these gummy bears! Right here! Right, let's have a look at this, Stephen. Yeah. Seriously, come over here, kids. Right. Yeah, welcome buddy. This one's gorgeous. Yeah, it's coming together pretty good. I love it. I love this, like, I mean, some space, empty space. Yeah, totally. I did take the plunge. I did take the plunge. I had to keep up with you. Good for you. Yeah. And you've even got yours blue as well. Gotta have them blue. So, client in the front. Yep, they hang out over here. It's kind of their own zone there. That's a bit of a change for me because previously I was, like, you know, like, kind of had a line of sight to them. Whereas now I'm just like, I'm hanging out back here, but it kind of works out. Like, it gives me an excuse to stretch my legs and like, I'll periodically come in and like, grab a chair and look at what they're looking at. And we can chat and, you know, still have a little bit of like, interface when we need to. Right. I'm going to interview you formally. Okay. I'm going to go put on a tie. Let's do it. If you could. That'd be great. So, just before you see Cullen's interview, I want to mention that the music on the montage at the beginning of this episode is from Audio. And they very kindly sponsored this video. As you know, I don't really do sponsored segments very often. And I only do it with companies who I'm very passionate about and whose products I'm genuinely using. So, I just want to quickly tell you why I love Audio. Those of you who follow my YouTube journey know that I'm not just passionate about color. I love my music. So, I'm on the Audio Pro license, which gives you unlimited music and sound effects, all cleared for YouTube and social media and broadcast. And it's everything that I need for any project, really. They've also got this brilliant new feature called Linkmatch AI. So, I can take a link from Spotify, YouTube, TikTok, SoundCloud, that sort of thing, put it into the AI search engine and it will go through the entire library and give me best matches in just a few seconds. And you get access to about 30,000 sound effects and you get this thing called Elements, so you can remove things like vocals. It gives you access to all the stems, basically. And I can get you 70% off the first year of the Pro license. Just use the coupon code DARREN when you go to the checkout. And Audio isn't just for individual creators and filmmakers. The Audio Enterprise subscription is ideal if you have more than 100 employees. So, the Enterprise subscription is complimentary song search. It's got worldwide music rights and a fully customizable subscription that's going to be just for your specific needs. So, go to audio.com.com.com.com.com. Click on the Enterprise button in the top corner of the website and be sure you mention me as the referral. And they're basically just a really nice company to deal with. They're all as passionate about music as I am. I'm going to put all those links in the description. Let's get back to the interview with Cullen. Cullen, good to see you again. Good to see you, buddy. New promises. Thank you. When was the last time I saw you? It's been... Oh, wait. No, it hasn't been two years because I saw you in Oregon 18 months ago. You sadly couldn't make the last... Couldn't make the last... Whoever had taken a landed in Portland and then immediately got into an airplane back to the US. Oh, that's right. Yeah, you actually got in the vicinity. Yes, exactly. You could have heard me if I yelled loudly. Only for about 10 minutes before I got right back on a plane. Well, you were missed, obviously. Yeah, thanks, man. So I'm on route to NAB. So doing my usual, let's hit LA for a few days. Yeah, but... You can see my favorite colorists. Yes. So I've got your way down the list. On the bottom. I mean, it's a stacked list. I'm going to see my favorite colorists. And I thought the route's not to see you as well. I'm just glad to be somewhere in the... Oh, no, it's always good. In the queue. But last time I saw you, you had a nice setup. But, in fact, you'd only just moved house, hadn't you? Yeah, we'd recently moved there, yeah. So, another baby. Another baby? Yeah. Is that why you're here? Yes, it is. Yeah, my house is officially owned by humans under the age of two now. Yeah. I just, you know, pay the water bill. My daughters are quite a bit older than your children. That's what I moved out as well. Yeah. Do you know what? We've got kids now. Time to get some grown-up studio space. Yeah. You guys do your thing here. I'm going to go and see if I can, you know, do things off-site somewhere. So this is pretty impressive, actually. I've only been here for about 20 minutes. Oh, thanks, man. I am liking the space. It's a really good size. Yeah, yeah. I'm super happy with it. It's as you'll relate to it, always takes a while to, like, get nested and comfortable in a new space. But, yeah, this one's come together with, like, you know, just getting all the pieces in place and making it feel cozy and optimized for client. And like you said, it's nice to have a dedicated kind of off-site space for doing your work. I mean, I think your client area is fantastic. This is, you've got 77-inch. What is that? Yeah, it's the C3, the LG. Yeah. So, I mean, it's great. It's comfortable. I mean, working behind, how are you liking that? Yeah, it's good. That one took a little bit of adjusting, but like that's one of those funny things that's like you're looking at the room and trying to figure out how do I make the best use of the room. As you might remember at the house, I had a good line of sight so I could make good eye contact with my clients. Yeah, we use that side on. Yeah, exactly. Which I love. Like, I love that setup, but this room, it just doesn't footprint out to allow for that without things being really funky. And it actually, it works out great. I've kind of gotten used to it and I just try to make it a point to come up from behind the console periodically and let them know I have a face, not just a voice. So, with the desk behind, does that stop the client? Because mine's at front. They get off the set and they just want to sit closer. It's like, look, there's a 55-inch screen on the wall. You don't have to come... It helps. The only downside is I've got my, it's more of a counter, I guess, than a desk. There's a seat there that's very inviting to certain clients who are of that persuasion, who want to be kind of up in your space. So, and I don't mind, like, that works out fine as well, but yeah, it definitely helps with like, having your back to the room can feel very vulnerable, can't it? Yeah. Because you're sneaking up on me right now. What's happening? Well, often I'll tell you I'm out there asleep. Or they're on the laptop. So, and actually what's nice is we've both, oh no, so you've got the XMP310, which is the new Flando Scientific Monitor. The viewing angle on that, I don't know if it's blown you away, but it's absolutely blown me away. Yeah, it's totally uniform, like full 180. It seems like. Great. So, I think that was always an issue with me having directors or DPs coming up front. Is there not quite seeing what I'm seeing? Yep, for sure. I think this is a real, yeah, that's a real added... Yeah, out of that monitor. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, and it's a great match to the OLEDs perceptually as well as, you know, by the numbers. I've got to get mine lined up yet. I've only had it a few weeks. But yeah, certainly enjoying it. Yeah. So, where are we? Can you talk about what this building is or is that kind of secret? Yeah, no, no secret there. So, we are in the Lola Visual Effects Building. These guys are old friends of mine who I've known for a number of years and it just was a good timing and good fit for me to take over some space here within the facility. And yeah, we're on the west side of LA, not too far from my house. And I think the clients like it better than driving to Marina Del Rey, which is where I was before. Yeah. So, you know, we're off when LA, what you call too far, that's me going on holiday. It's all about timing. In the morning, it's like 15 minutes. When we drive, when I'm leaving here today, it's going to be like 45 minutes to get home. So, all depends on when you're trying to do it. Very good. Very good. So, how long have you been here? Almost six months now. Okay. And does it work? Because obviously there's big VFX shooting going on. So, is this helping game work? Are you getting some VFX work from that? Yeah, we've got some good synergy happening because, you know, obviously like VFX and color are very intertwined elements. So I've got some great resources at my disposal for like, hey, can we easily ship this out for a quick screen replace or even something more complex? And likewise, there's people walking through it all the time who need color work in addition to their visual effects work. So, that was part of the idea of kind of setting up the space here as we did and it's working out nicely so far. And has this given you new clients? Extra? Are your other clients still happy coming out here with a... Yeah. I think it's probably been anyway. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean, I'd say I don't think it's bumped anyone who was happy before and it has led to an easier time of bringing in some new clients in terms of like location and like the amenities and all that stuff that is available here. And there's also just like all that boring stuff like security protocols and things that are a lot more buttoned up here than in my garage, if you can imagine that. Yeah, really? What do you know? I'm not TPN certified in my garage. It's up to get. Yeah, right. You just got to get past the wife. Exactly. Good. Well, I put a little thing out on my YouTube community saying if perchance happens to be in LA and bumps into Cullen by some random miracle, what would you ask him? Are you up for some random questions? As long as I don't want to know my secret smoothie recipe. I'll give you that one offline. Hang on. I've got to log into my phone now. So, well, actually, I can cut this down. So there was quite a few people. Let's do a quick name check. Equistumink. I forgot that right. Equistumink and dye underscore dunk hilt. Dunk hilt. I think I've got that right. Sorry if I got that wrong. Most people seem to be inquisitive or asking why is why are no trees are like they are. I knew this would come up every time. I think what's interesting, I've got my no tree. You've got your no tree. We're both doing very well teaching the world how to do color grading, but we're both actually working in a completely different way. It's actually quite, I find it quite interesting. I couldn't work with your no tree. I feel like I could work with your no tree. I see the logic of it. So we've got the answer. Yeah. There we go. I just got to switch over. It's done in fact. Equistumink says I use a hybrid of your no graphs. Interesting. Yeah. You know what? A collaboration would be fantastic if we designed our own and set it. Yeah. Let's get together and make our own hybrid no tree. That's cool to hear that people are putting the pieces together and building stuff that works for them. That's what we want, right? Yeah. That's actually great because there's no wrong way to get there. But I think with how my no tree work, because I do a lot of documentary work, so my main stuff is like music videos and documentary. The documentary stuff, I couldn't work with your no tree because it's so small. I don't know if you work with a larger one. The one I have on YouTube, if I'm being absolutely transparent, it is slightly larger for my documentary work. Right. It's too complicated to explain on YouTube each episode. So I have a bit more grouping going on than it is. But what you're seeing on YouTube is the real workflow. I've just taken out the groups and it kind of is a bit more than that as well. But for me, I do a lot of what's called ripple grading. So I'll do a change and I'll just ripple it across to a group of shots. And I switch things on and off very quickly. So I have things pre-built. You all seem to be a bit more, I don't know if you tell me, but I feel yours is, you're sort of crafting it for each job. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it. And we'll have to turn the tables. I want to grill you about rippling and the way you do that because that's actually super cool and I'm very curious about it. Yeah, I think for me, what I'm doing is I'm trying to, I'll give it to you this way. This is like an analogy I share sometimes. There's like a gaffer buddy of mine years ago gave me this great piece of wisdom about working on set. They're like, whatever your lighting package is on set, if you've got a one ton, a five ton, a 10 ton, it doesn't matter how big it is relative to the needs of the production. Whatever that lighting package is, every single stick of gear is going to come off of that truck no matter how big the truck is. So that's always my feeling with template notaries is like, if I have more template or more nodes in my tree, they're going to get used. And if I have fewer, then I'm going to use fewer. Either way, I'm going to get to a similar result. I don't think we're not getting to worse or better results based on our notary. We're figuring out how to work within those constraints. It's kind of my general philosophy. So I like that. So sorry to interrupt. Are you then restricting yourself? Are you saying this is my notary? Definitely not. I will make it work with it. No. So as I said, I'm kind of Alucard going like, hey, if I need to spin up 20 more nodes to make this shot sing, that's what I'll do as opposed to having it sort of like the space pre allotted, which as I said, I do see the logic of as well, especially if you're having to do like a lot of nonfiction work or work super, super quickly. That does add a little bit of that can add a little bit of time, you know, drag if you're having to add that stuff over and over. Are you doing sessions where you have to do 3, 400, 500 shots a day? Generally no. I can't say I enjoy it, but fortunately it's what pays. That's the gig. That's the gig. Food on my children's table. Yeah. Yeah. We'll do them sometimes, but it's also like, there's, I think there is a bit of a difference if you're talking about like nonfiction versus, you know, like narrative, you know, fiction type stuff. A lot of like the DNA or the identity of a shot that all grade, it's driven more by the overall like pipeline and the print stock, if you like. So there's not as much DNA identity being imparted by the grade itself. It's like by the time you get the right look in place, the right exposure ratio balance kind of saturation levels, that's like 90% of what I'm going to do. Yep. Okay. So in terms of that on my notary, this is where, because you're sort of branches off straight away from, so you're paralleling immediately. Mine is more what you just said. I'm getting it. I've got the look solid and it should be like, let's argue 90% there. Then I'm branching off. Yeah. And I see that logic because theoretically by the time you're balanced and sort of level, you're feeding probably a higher quality image state to your secondaries, which makes sense to me. I think the flip side of the coin for me is I like the first thing that I do, if I get a piece of feedback, whether it's on a second pass or a 10th pass, I'm going, how can I address that in my first three nodes? If I can do it in the first three nodes, I don't want to add more nodes. So as a result, those first three nodes are constantly changing for me. So if I have secondaries that are dependent on that image state, I feel like I run the risk of the qualification or the secondary breaking because it was made on a different state of image than I'm feeding it in the second or the fifth pass or whatever it might be. Okay. So yeah, okay. That's interesting because I do have a little bit that runs off that I don't really have on my YouTube channel, which is quite hard to explain, but for doing the qualifications and things like that. Yeah. Like kind of a breakout. Yeah. It's just a branch. Yeah. It's just a branch type thing. So I'm always feeding my qualification from the original. There we go. Yeah. You see, we're not so different you and me. No, maybe not. We can be friends after all. I like the idea of, yeah, a hybrid node tree of the two of us. I think it's good. But for me, it's still this rippling and having the documentary like, can we just try it a bit more cooler in the shadows or something? Yeah. I got to spare a node. Ripple. Let's try it. Okay. So this is perfect. I wanted to ask you about the rippling thing. That's pretty like one of the more common use cases, what you just said, where you're like, oh, I'm going to do like a little bit of creative character in the shadows and I want to push that out across all the shots. That's like a good example of the way you use it. So far I'm doing shadow work using the log tools, which I like to do, which I know is a style that you're not sort of favored to. Yeah. I like the log tool. But I know that's node seven. So I can go straight to my node seven. I'm not labeled as well as they should be. They're labeled in my node. But you know. I know it's one of them. And then I can literally make that adjustment and ripple it across the group. So my groups are well defined before I start my documentary. So I know it's by camera and by scene. So you've got two camera interviews set up. I've got two groups for that scene. So I know when I ripple that group, node number seven is just going to fly across the lot and I trust it. See this is fascinating. And I think an interesting example as well of where we're actually converging on the same philosophy, just using slightly different techniques. What you're talking about is very consistently rippling something that works across all the shots that need it without introducing localized variation, which always bugged me from like the colors I would learn from. They would do that log adjustment 10 different ways on 10 different shots. Okay. So across multiple nodes. Yeah. Yeah. I just mean like they would do it. Like, oh, that cool push in the shadows with the log wheels works really nice on shot number two. Let's do something similar using my hands again on shot number three, then shot number four and shot number five. And then you end up with like a perfect implementation of it in one shot and a 10th best implementation of it in some other shot. Right. So if I've done my maths correctly on my first three or four nodes, it should be getting the same adjustment. No, number seven should give it the same. 100%. Yeah. And so like that's what's so interesting is for me, I'm getting it that same thing, usually by flipping over to some sort of macro level slot that I have either at the group post clip or at the timeline where we might be electing the same exact thing. I want to get a bit more of a cool push in the shadows. I will implement that in some sort of macro level position, but the result is the same. It's a consistency of like optimal adjustment that's hitting all the shots that it needs to in the same way. So we're, I feel like aligned in outcomes there. Yeah. And I think I've actually learned a bit more about your node tree. So I've been, you know. So yeah, no, likewise. That's the, I mean, those are, I feel like we're talking about something that's so important, that's so many colours. I respect yours more now. Hey, yeah. I'm still wrong, but. Hey, I feel like we could do like a parent trap situation and like you could do my node tree and I would do yours. I feel like I could adapt to yours. Do you know what? I wouldn't mind trying that. That would be kind of fun, right? Yeah. In fact, we should do that. Do I have to use, I don't have to use all the nodes, right? No, that's the whole point. They're ready to switch on and off. So by default, they're off. Or, yeah, they're just not. It reminds me a little bit, have you gotten the chance to chat with Mark Todd Osborn and look at his template node tree at all? So I'm just, in fact, I did see he's got about 50 nodes going on. Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a scaled version, but really similar to what, the way you do it. He's got everything has a place. He knows every number of it. Yeah, I've not got 50 nodes. Yeah, no, you're a little more trim than that. I'm high 20s. High 20s. Mid 20s. Yeah. For most things. I've got several that I use, but. Yeah. Yeah, okay, interesting. I'll work into that. Yeah. Hang out with colorists in LA. So, yeah, Lynette this morning, which is lovely. Oh, super cool. Lynette, that's the thing. Yeah. Yeah, no, I think that's, it's really cool to look at those, these different approaches, and I love hearing that people are sort of taking what they like from both of our schools of thought or approaches and finding something that works for them. It's really all we're talking about, right? It's like this clicks in my brain and lets me get optimal results quickly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, well, let's do that challenge. So we'll get a shot, not now. Yeah. Right now. So, you have to use my notary to see what it looks like. Yeah. That'll be a YouTube episode coming. Yeah, that'll be really, that'll be our feature film. Okay, right, we'll do that. Right, so let me have a look at the other questions. Oh, in fact, talking of that, I mean, obviously, I see your notary a lot because I catch grade school whenever I can. It's a really awkward time for me because it's six o'clock on a Friday in the UK. Yeah, that's like quitting time for you. So, I'm either at the pub or. But I'm always flattered when you turn up. And I catch up on a few of them, but, you know, that's where I'm sort of learning what your notary is doing. And I've learned a lot from it. I mean, always learning. Yeah, same here. Yeah, that's what I love about this whole art. But your grade school, just talk about that for a little while, you recently passed a hundred grade schools. I've got to give you like full respect for that. Oh, thanks, man. Turning it every Friday to rock that out. Yeah, I mean, that's been within, I know we both have gotten so much joy and, you know, like reward out of YouTube just from getting to find our communities and, you know, like share what we love with other people who love it. But even within the YouTube lane, like grade school specifically for me has been like such a special part of it. Just because it's been like, like that's where some of my most passionate community members show up week after week. It's not just me, like they have to show up too and they always do. And it's also been like, you know, for all of this, you know, like education and talking on camera and all these awkward things that we have to learn how to do. It's been like my gym, you know, like when I did the first one, I can still remember having my laptop and like reading questions and thumbing through it and stuff. And it's like people respect that. Yeah. I mean, I've seen it a few times and we can't hear you for three minutes. Yeah. Or here, Gidali, who's here. Hello, Gidali. Yeah. Gidali's hanging out. Um, that's part of it. Yeah, totally. And it's over after an hour. Yeah. So you switch off, you're going to have a cup of tea. Yeah. Yeah. And no one dies and it's all okay. Yeah. Whether it's tech hiccups. But if you're making a one hour YouTube episode, that'd take me three days. Yeah. You know what? It's funny you mentioned that. That's that's one of my favorite things about the live thing is like, I'm sure you can relate to this. You can't call cut and do another take. No. You just have to keep rolling. But you haven't seen my lives. I would need to a lot of takes. My absolute car crash every time. I haven't seen you've only done you do them usually like even a few on the channel. I do. Yeah, I give away stuff. So I'll do one at Christmas. Oh, what's some stuff? I got to come for the next one. Come on, maybe I'll score something sweet. I do them every now and again just for a bit. I used to do them every 10,000. But I've kind of. I know the channel is growing quick. Yeah, you're going to have to start doing them on a Friday. Cadence like me at this point. Dear. So actually on the grade school, I know one question from our very good dear friend, Jim Robinson, Jim, who you know. And yes, I do. He's he's got quite a good question, actually. And I know he's probably religiously on every Friday. And so I'm up. Yeah, that's my dude. So Jim asks, do you ever read back the chat in the grade school presentations? There's a lot of conversation in there that I think would be of great interest to him. I usually the only time I will read it back is right after we go off the air. And I'm like, oh, wow, look at all this cool conversation that was happening. But that's usually about the extent of it. Although he's totally right that I every time I look at him, like, yeah, that's a lot of really good discourse. I feel kind of similar to that way, like in my discord community, we're like a thousand plus members strong now. And really it's I really can't describe the cocktail of feelings I have about the community. Like it's the best color grading community that I've ever encountered. And there's only awesome knowledge being exchanged, like free flowing 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But I it's like somewhere between excitement and total overwhelm at this point, because like I just don't get the chance to like digest at all on a regular basis. So these are people who've been on your Color Academy. Yep. These are alums of my colorist career accelerator course, who that's, you know, part of the benefit of joining this. You'll become part of a community of professional colorists. And I think what's good about that, I do one for my mascot. So I've got a Facebook group. You've also done the masterclass first, but everyone's then at the same knowledge. Yes, exactly. It's actually really interesting. And they're not asking very basic questions, which I've got no problem with. But, you know, no, everyone's got a certain commitment level at that point, which is great. But I find that everyone really helps each other as well. Like they're for sure. The Facebook is almost runs itself. I don't, you know, I'll see how part this way. But they're same. They're just helping each other. It's fantastic. Well, I feel like that's like we've chatted about this before, but that's one of the most fun things that I feel like you and I have gotten to participate in is watching the color grading industry go from being very secret saucy and sort of gate capped to a much more open exchange of ideas and information. Yeah. And it's cool to just be along for that ride. Yeah, exactly. It's okay. Yeah. Just share information. You're still learning. We've just been chatting earlier. Yeah. We both just picked up some new knowledge. Yeah, totally. You schooled me on my node numbering. Yeah. So it's, you know, I love it. Yeah, absolutely. Let's see if I've got any more for you before we wrap it up. Yeah. What else you got for me? What do you think about HDR for YouTube without opening up a whole HDR world of, you know what? I'm what I can say about HDR for YouTube is we recently delivered an HDR film for YouTube. And I think the punchline is that we figured out like a repeatable process for doing it. But I full disclosure, I wasn't the one like in the trenches figuring it out. It was one of my very smart team members, but it took like days to figure it out. And it was not a straightforward solution, whatever we arrived at. So I think it's a great idea. I also think like HDR could be a much simpler thing than tech specs and private interests make it out to be. It's just a brighter image. Yeah. You don't need a difference display standard. Well, it should be pretty much the same image. Yes. 100%. With a bit of brightness. 100%. When I, you know, like when we calibrate our monitors, it's like, do you calibrate to have 120, 250, not changing the gamma curve, not changing the character of the image. It's just how bright is the brightest thing. I mean, I've not even thought about it for YouTube, to be honest. Yeah. I sort of forget it does HDR. You know, I mean, this is a tangent, but my favorite sort of like distillation of the whole HDR thing comes from a friend of mine, a colorist friend here in LA, who says HDR really at the end of the day, its main benefit is to allow an image to hold up and to look the same under a wider variety of viewing conditions. So when our parents are watching in the living room and there's sunlight pouring in, a 500 nit or 1000 nit master has got a much better shot at like feeling similar in contrast than, you know, a 100 nit peak type of image. Yeah, I think that's a good way to put it. So whatever device you're on, it'll hold up. You should be penalized if you've got a more advanced screen. Right. But also, you know, the reason I'm still not even thinking about HDR for YouTube is I want everyone to enjoy it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. In terms of like our kind, like I also like this is the other like probably the kind of worms you were talking about with HDR, but then comes the thing of like, well, how much more do you want to see in terms of stretched out highlights? And for me, like if you're watching color grading tutorials, like on a park bench at one in the afternoon, then I might suggest to you that you hold off until you can get home where those details kind of matter. Yeah, sure. So that question was from Maximo Joshua, by the way, so I did say at Namecheck. No more? Yeah, hit me. Chris Meisowinski. God, I have to pick the ones with the hard names. Yeah, look at you. What DCT are you cooking up next? We're looking forward to it. Oh, man, I've got so many of them and they're like trying to think of which ones I'm most excited about right now. You know, the one that I've been working on in the background for a really long time that I don't think I've shown, like at least outside of my color grading community, it's just a primary note. It just lets me do it. I've not seen it. Yeah, I'll show it to you before we wrap today. It's just tonal stuff. It's just exposure, contrast and like all the little micro manipulations that I like to make in a color curve in a way that makes sense to be in maps to knobs in an intuitive way. Yeah. Okay, cool. And Gareth Pierce, 5255. Don't know, but sure as in. Not sure the significance there. Wants to know what hair product you use. Oh, I know she's didn't ask me what hair products I use. We can compare notes on this too. I'm a I like the Swabasito matte pomade. Well, that by me again. It's a it's a matte pomade by Swabasito. Maybe we're just talking about shampoo. I mean, if they see this, send us a box. Yeah, I'll try it. If I can get my hair looking like yours, I'll be a very man. That's it for the questions. I think that's it. Let's chat with you again. Yeah. You're any B. Yeah, in and out for a day, one day next week should be fun. I'll try to make all my rounds and make an efficient run of it and then get back home and take care of my kiddos. Perfect. Well, I'm looking forward to seeing them later on. Going to yours for dinner. You've kindly invited me. Yes, we're going to break some bread and bridge it in the new one. Yep. Connor. That's right. Looking forward to it. All right, mate. Always good to see you. Good to see you buddy. Take care. That was actually an interesting chat. That was, yeah, no, we got to, that's really good. Yeah. That's what I wanted to do it live. Yeah. Yeah, that's way better than if we'd like done it. So on the record, that was live and not rehearsed. Yeah.
