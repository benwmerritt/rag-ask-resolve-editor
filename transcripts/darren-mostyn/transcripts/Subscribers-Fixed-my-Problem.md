## Transcript
So, this is just a really quick episode to show you two things. One is a Black Friday offer that's coming that I can actually beat and the second one is a fix for an issue I had on my last video. So my last video was talking about Nob Omniscope. This is the scopes from Time in Pixel that I use on all my broadcast work. If you're desperate to find out the discount code that I can offer you, the link is in the description so you don't have to watch this bit if you don't want. But that video, I'm going to put a link to it up here. At a certain point in it, I used a special technique and I had to do a little bit of a work around and I want to show you a fix for that right now. So this is the clip that I was trying to balance and the technique I was using in that video is called versions up here. Now, versions allows you to select different options here, i.e. selected clips, play heads, selected stills and you can use them side by side to actually help balance your shots. So what I was doing was choosing selected clips from here and then I'm going to select the clip next to it and then you see the two clips side by side. Now this allows me to balance it really easily on my scopes and I did all this in-depth in that episode. Now the issue I've got is it puts a white line around the clip that is highlighted and this obviously affects the trace on the scope. Now I didn't know you could get around that but two of my subscribers actually commented, I'm going to name check them, it's Film Noir and Jamie M. So thank you very much for this. I actually showed me a tip on how to get rid of that and I didn't even know you could do this. So to pick up here, I'm going to go to split screen and down here you can take off the show outline and that now gives me a perfect trace on my scopes allowing to balance using the technique that was in that video. So just goes to show you that you are always learning. So TimingPixels have announced their Black Friday deal, they're giving you 30% off-nob OmniScope. Go to timepixels.com and you'll see all the details there but I can better that. I can get you 35% off from now until November the 30th. Use the code Darren instead of their code, you're going to get an extra 5%. It is never going to be cheaper than this. If you want to get no OmniScope, now is the time to do it. This is the scopes I use on all my broadcast programming. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode.
