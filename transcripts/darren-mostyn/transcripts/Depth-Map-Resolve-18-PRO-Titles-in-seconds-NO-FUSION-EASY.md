So if you want to be able to make really stylish titles that look something like this, I'm going to show you how to do that within just a few minutes without drawing any shapes and mats and without any key framing. It's really simple to do and that's because there's a brand new tool called the DepthMap. Now this is brand new in version 18. It's still in beta obviously. It is also part of the Studio Pack. So you need the studio license in order to activate it because it's using the DaVinci Neural Engine which is like the AI stuff. And you'll see why. This is a smart tool. So to get this character to be blocked out of the text, we're going to use the DepthMap. So this is here just because I've pre-rendered it. This effect is quite slow but I'm going to show you how to build it anyway. So here is the original video clip. It's just some video layer one and it's just a gymnast. Now I've chosen something that has got a lot of movement in it and traditionally we would have had to draw them around this character and key frame every single frame in order to separate that text from the background. But I'm going to show you how to do it with the DepthMap. So we've got video layer one. Video layer two is going to be our text. Okay, so let's put our text on there. I'm going to use just a basic text for now. Okay, I'm going to sit that on top. I'm just going to bring it up in size a little bit. Okay, and as you see that's just sitting on top as it would normally. But we're going to create a third video layer and this is going to be our foreground. So this layer video one is going to be our background. I'm going to press option and drag the video up which will make a duplicate of it and that's going to sit on video layer three. Now how do we get to see our text? Now obviously I can't see the text now because this video layer three it has priority over video layer two so I can't see anything. So if I drew a map shape around this character we would reveal the text and the background below but we're not going to do that. We're going to use the DepthMap. So if I go to my effects and come down here there's a new feature in version 18 called DepthMap. If I can find it there it is. I'm going to drag and drop that on to my foreground. Now this effect is quite slow. I'm not going to lie. So in order to activate it go to your inspector here. If your inspector is not open just click here. Go to effects and there's the DepthMap and it defaults to better quality. Now if we switch that to faster it drops the quality resolution just slightly and allows us to set up the DepthMap a little bit quicker. Now how this works is anything black will reveal any video layers below and anything white will stay as foreground. So watch what happens when I take off the DepthMap preview now. There we can see our text and we can see our character but he's only sort of half mixed between the letters. He's not actually covering the letters. And that's because in our DepthMap we haven't got a solid white yet. So in order to get him completely covering the text this map preview needs to be white. So how do we do that? I've put it into faster just so the controls behave a little bit quicker. I'm going to go to adjust map levels and we've got our file limit and near limit. So what the DepthMap is doing is intelligently analyzing the video footage and working out what's in the foreground and what's in the background and it's drawing this scale. So white would be foreground, back would be our background or you can invert that. So I'm going to bring my near limit forward. I'm going to bring that down and you can see that slowly starts to get white in there. So the more white it is the more solid the character is going to be or the object or whatever you want to work with. And I'm going to take my file limit and I'm just going to push that out a bit. So we've got a much better image going on now. So if I take my DepthMap preview off you can see now he's starting to cover the letters but we've still got a little bit of opacity in there. So we still need to do a bit more work. So let's put the map preview back on. Let's just get our near limits so we can get that a bit tighter. And what I'm going to do is use the isolation tool down here now to just that is going to clean this up a little bit. So what we can do now is bring our Depth Forward and there we go. And that is much better. Let's just put a little bit of softness on that. And you can go to finesse here and that will do it even finer. So you can start looking at hair detail and all that stuff but it's going to slow it right down at the minute. So this is going to be fine for us. So let's take that off and now you can see he's completely covering the text. So if I just play that through it's going to be a little bit slow but there we go. We've got our character completely covering the text and we haven't had to draw a shape or draw any maths or anything like that. This is really quick and easy way of doing this. This would take hours to do this manually by hand. Okay, what I'm going to do is go beyond that because in my version what I showed you was quite a stylish bit of text. And these texts, this is a preset that comes from a company called Motion VFX and they've got a whole load of preset titles that work with DaVinci Resolve. I've been using them for the last few months and they are fantastic. So I'm going to show you an example of just how quick you can get an animated text in without even having to do any keyframing yourself. I've got the one installed here is called Hype. So it's M title Hype and it comes with all these presets here and you can actually even preview them just by hovering your mouse over them. Okay, and the one I used is this one which is defaults to say pursue your dreams. Obviously, you can change the text to be whatever you want. So as I click on that, there's our update. There's our character going over it. I'm just going to make it a little bit bigger. So again, if I just click on the title, the inspector allows me to make adjustments. Click in here. Let's just change the scale. And there is a link in the description for a discount code on these M title titles. They are fantastic. They're basically accessing fusion. So they're really customizable. So there's my scale on that one. Let's adjust each individual title. So I've got the word your there. It's quite small so I can go down to your. I can change the font. I can change the color. A little bit slow to behave because I've got obviously the depth map sitting on top of it. But you can see there I can adjust the scaling and the positioning and all that sort of stuff. So it literally is just moving around. I'm no compositor and this is really simple. Really simple for me to do. So I'm going to drag that back. Let's have a quick preview. You can see the red line at the top. I've got my cashing on. So in order to do that, if you go up to here and go to render cash, I've got mine on to user. So it knows that I want to do it. You can put it on to smart so it recognizes when it needs to. And you couldn't of course switch it off. OK, so let's just play that through. So when it goes blue, it means it's cached. I'm on an older Mac here because this is a beta version. So I'm running it on my old Mac trash can. I'm not on my Mac Pro 2019. So it's a little bit slower to behave. But that gives us a pretty fair representation of what's going on. So we built this really cool effect very quickly. There's a little bit of this hand coming through still there. So we've got to do click back here. Let's go back to our effects and we're just going to adjust our depth map for a little bit more. And then you can see it's not quite white there. Let's just push it forward a little bit more. So I've got the wrong way. OK, and there we go. Something like that. OK, now before I switch it off, I'm going to go to better, which is going to give us much better quality. And then all you've got to do is render that out. So it's a really quick and easy way of building up these really stylish background texts with your foreground still in the foreground without creating any mats or anything at all. So let's have a look at the finished thing. That is a great looking title sequence built in just a few minutes without any compositing knowledge at all. If you've enjoyed this, have a look at some of the other stuff on my channel. YouTube is going to recommend something for you here. Look after yourselves and I'll see you in the next episode. Lou, hi darling. I'm just recording for YouTube. How much do you need? OK, I'll send it right now.
