Hi, my name is Darren Mostyn and in this episode we're going to be looking at the tracker. Now Resolve has undoubtedly one of the finest trackers in the world but what you do when things don't quite go to plan, I'm going to show you how to fix those tracks that didn't quite work as you expected. So let's go and take a look. So this shot is taken from an actual commercial I graded a few years ago and what we're going to do is look at this particular shot here. Now I'm going to go into enhanced viewer mode which is Alt F and that gives us a bigger view to look at when we're looking at the tracking and I'm just going to bring the nodes back on by clicking up here. So we can see now we've got four nodes here. This one is actually a compound node so it actually contains a lot of nodes to get the grade to this point. So if I just press Command D that's the original camera raw footage and that's with the grade so far but there's a couple of things we want to do to this shot. So I'm just going to play it through and you see it's a tracking shot and there's quite a bit going on in there. So we've got a lot of people crossing scene and that sort of thing. What we want to do is make three adjustments. I'm going to adjust this door here. We're going to adjust this woman's coat as she goes past. Again, we're going to have to track this and we're going to adjust the actual taxi itself. Now the main branding colors for this commercial is the red of the taxi and as we move forward through the shot you see this woman enters set wearing a coat with a bright red patch on the back. Now I felt that was a little bit distracting from the branded colors here so we're going to make a change to that and just change its hue. So let's move on to this node here, label coat and if we take a qualifier we can grab a sample of the red there. Let's put the highlight on so we can see what we've grabbed and let's just give that a little bit more of a tweak just to check we're getting the best out of it. Let's clean that up a little bit, a bit of de-noise and you'll see that we've also picking up some other elements in the scene so we need to obviously isolate this with a power window. So let's take the highlight off and just to show you what we're going to do we're going to start rotating the hue here to give us a better look. Just put that on, I'm just going to bring the saturation down a little bit. So something like that but we're obviously affecting now the taxi, this sign up here and probably the pillar box, yeah there's a pillar box here as well. Let me just fine tune this a little bit, just see if we can get that a little bit better. Something like that. So I need a power window to isolate this so these other things aren't affected so let's go to our window here. I'm going to draw a shape. Okay so we've now isolated the coats so that's much better. I'm going to just bring the saturation down a little bit more on that but obviously she's moving so we need to have that power window move with her and to do that we need to go on to the tracker. So this is the tracker, you have track forwards and track backwards, it will automatically start doing it straight away. You don't need to know anything about any of these other menus here, you can literally just press track forward and it will start tracking automatically. But just so you know we are using a window tracker here. So there is also a stabiliser and there's also an effects tracker. We're only going to look in this episode at the window tracker so it's basically going to track the window that is currently active. So in here you can have multiple windows and the one that's active is the one that is going to be tracked. We're not tracking from the beginning of the shot because obviously she's not in the shot at that point so we're going to track from this point here so I'm going to need to track forwards and then I'm going to need to come back to this point and track backwards. So let's see what happens when we track forwards from here. So I'm just going to press the tracker and we're using what's called the cloud tracker. Now the cloud tracker is allowing Resolve to automatically pick tracking points for me within that window and giving me my best chance of getting a good track. Now the tracker in Resolve is fantastic but I've purposefully chosen things that are going to break because I want to show you how to fix them when the tracking doesn't go right. So let's track forwards and there we go. So she gets a good point but when we hit the lamp post the tracker gets confused and it breaks. So in order to fix that let's just come back to the point where she was good. So we're going about here. So clip mode affects the whole clip whereas frame affects just this frame in time. So what I'm going to do is just make any adjustment I like on here and that will automatically add a key frame for me. I can move forward as many frames as I need to. So let's go to the very end of the shot and what I'm going to do is stay in frame mode and I'm going to move this over like so and that has automatically added another key frame for me. So Resolve now calculates the difference between this frame and this frame and does the work for me. So as I move forward frame at a time we've now fixed that track. Okay so we've now got a really good track through there and if we go back to the point where we started tracking from this frame here we now need to obviously track in reverse so we can get her coming from off the scene. So if I just go back you'll see obviously that tracking that window is not tracking at the minute. So let's go to here and I could manually key frame that or just go to the clip and press reverse and that still needs a bit of a hand. So I'm going to go to my frame mode here. Let's go a few more frames back and then I'm just going to take that off there. So you see it's added a key frame for me automatically. Let's step through frame at a time just check it's good and there we go we're good to go. So that's now fixed using frame mode and just to be safe I'm going to put that back into clip mode ready for our next shot. Okay so the next thing we want to change is this door so I'm going to click on this node here and the orange of this door is not quite sitting well in the scene so we're going to just tweak that a little bit. Again similar to what we did with the coat and let's just find a frame where we've got the hole of the door in and we go and I'm going to use a qualifier exactly as we did before put the highlight on and just check that my qualification is good. Okay something like that I'm not going to spend too long doing this and you can see it's also picking up the orange in the taxi sign there so we need to obviously put a power window on this so let's go to our windows so that we isolate it. I'm going to click on this rectangle window. Let's put the points on here now what I often do with these when they've got softness built into them automatically is I take the softness off and it really does help with the tracking. Let's take the softness down and I can add it back on after so once we've done once we've got the tracking data I can add that softness back on. Let's go to our tracker and I'm going to track forwards so we're in window we're on clip mode so it's going to analyze the entire clip and let's go forward. Okay so that's done a good job of that let's go to this point here and track backwards so there we've got a problem so it's been picked up by this moving coat so that is not a very good track so what we could do is key frame it as we did before but I want to show you a different technique so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on these three dots which is a tracker menu and I'm going to say reset the track data on the active window so I've cleared all those tracking points away and what we're actually going to do is track a different part of the frame so because this woman walks in front of the door it ruins the track so if we can find a part of the frame that moves exactly the same as the door but doesn't have anyone crossing it we should get a better track so what I'm going to do is go up to here and I'm going to track this sign instead so we get good clean tracking data which we can then apply to the door and I'll show you how we do that so I'm at the beginning of the frame we're going to press track forward okay and then I come back to the beginning of the frame and what I'm going to do is realign that and because we're in clip mode and not frame mode here it's going to apply to the whole clip we've already got the tracking data and if I now press play it's taken the tracking data from the sign but we've just moved it down to the door now you see that's obviously got problems here because what's happening is we're getting data that we don't need in here causing this frame to not look very good so again I'm going to delete that tracking data I am back to the beginning and this time what we're going to do is the same track but we're going to take off some elements we're going to take off 3d we're going to take off the rotation and we're going to take off the zoom so all we're doing is taking tracking data for pan and tilt so let's put this back on where it was and this way we should get just the data that we want and I'm going to track forward and back to the beginning now let's apply that back to the door remember the reason we're putting a window around the door is so that we can change its color without affecting the lights on the taxi and let's play that through so the tracking data it's just got I'm just pressing play I'm not hitting this track button I'm just pressing play is now much much better so this door this frame is not moving up the doors because we've taken off zoom rotate and 3d out of the equation so now what I can do is adjust the color of the door quite happily so let's go to our hue let's take a bit of the saturation out of that I'd need to adjust my qualification a little bit better to get that out more accurate but it's good enough for this and I can even now go back to my window and put a soft edge on that if I want and because we're in clip mode in the tracker it applies to the whole clip not just a frame if I did that in frame mode it would just put softness on at that frame so that's another good way so don't always track the object you want you can track objects that are moving similarly and then just move the window later and the tracking data is already applied so just before we get to the end of this episode I just want to take a minute and say thank you to everyone who subscribed to my channel I've got 4,000 subscribers now in under four months so the channel is growing really quickly I'm so pleased and thank you each and every one of you thank you very much indeed and hit the subscription button if you haven't already hit the notification bell and hit the thumbs up apparently that does wonders for the algorithm for YouTube and let's have a look at the rest of the episode so now we're going to take a look at the taxi so I'm going to click on this node here labeled taxi and the first thing I want to do is put back on the parameters that we took off to get a good track on the door so when I do my first track I always have all five parameters on see the quality of it and then decide if I'm going to take one or two of them off so what we're going to do on this one is adjust the red color so again we've got other red items in the scene so we're going to have to isolate it with a window so let's go ahead and grab a power window I'm going to draw around the taxi I need to get a little bit tighter here because at the end of the scene we go very near that pillow box and there okay so that's done and what I'm going to do now is hit track forward so we go to our tracker and then I'm going to go back to here and track backwards so let's take a look at that track so if we go forward through here you see it starts off well and then it gets moved a little bit here and you'll also find that it starts to come right out here when this couple walk into the shot so we're going to try and fix that so the first thing I'm going to do is delete that tracking data so we can click in here and say reset track data by the way what you can also do in here is you if there's just a little bit that's gone wrong you can actually highlight a section click in here so if this imagine this was you saw sort of a big spike in here so the tracking had gone off just for a little moment you can select a selection and then you can click in here clear selected track data and that actually just does an automatic key frame from here to here so it's quite a good way of just fixing little problems that you might get with the tracker but in this case we're going to delete the whole track so let's get rid of all that data let's go back I'm going to do it from the beginning this time so my window is in pretty good shape there but what I'm going to do this time is go down to this interactive mode so if I click on here what can actually do now is add points or remove points so what I want to do is where this came right out when that couple walks into the shot so just about here you see this all stretched out over here so what I'm going to do is come back and I'm going to just remove by just literally clicking on the screen if I press now delete all the crosshairs all the tracking points that are inside this frame here will be deleted so I'm just going to basically exclude them from the track so the only tracking points are going to be more at the front of the taxi so let's track that forward and see how that looks and there we go so we've got a much cleaner track there much better on this side as well and I'm going to do a little bit of tweaking here but it's got us into a really good starting point so I'm going to flick over to frame mode I remember now what it does is it just adjusts at the point I am so let's start at the beginning and I'm just playing that through I'm not pressing forwards here I'm just playing and it all's good and just about here we're starting to come over on top of the red I'm trying to isolate the red here so I'm just going to do a little move I'm just add a point there again it's creeping back in a little bit so let's just pull it out a little bit there and we're good now the only thing we have to watch is the back of the taxi there's a bit of red here so I need to just pull that out a little bit further let's just check that works for the whole shot and yes it does so we've got all the red inside the window here so that's good to go now I'm going to add a little bit of softness just in case I always put a bit of softness on my windows and let's just go to the end and just check that we're not bleeding over into this letterbox here so we are just a little bit so I'm just going to adjust that again there and our thought also notice here it's come back out again so let's just check that we're on frame mode and there we go so that's good to go okay so now we can go and make the adjustment to the red so if I go to my qualifier and sample the red again like we did with the coat and the door let's just tweak that a little bit I will do a dedicated episode on the qualifier so you can see in a bit more detail how I do this but that will do for now let's take off the highlight and I'm just going to increase the saturation and I'm just going to lower the gamma a little bit just to make that a little bit more poppy so I'm just pressing command D to switch that node on and off and you can see now that because of the power window around the outside let's have a look at the power window that we're not affecting this letterbox or this sign up here so we've got a nice qualification we've got it messed off with our power window and we've got it nicely tracked so just to recap to get better tracking have a look at taking this soft edge off your power windows first and then you can always add it back on after you've done the tracking and remember to be in clip mode to do that so it applies to the whole clip and not just a single frame go to frame mode to do sort of fine tuning and small detailed work like this and the keyframes are applied automatically think about not using all five of these items if it's going to cause you problems so sometimes rotation or zoom might be causing you issues just switch them off and think about using the interactive mode so when you're down here you can switch interactive mode on and select which part of the power window you want to be incorporated into the tracking so remember all these cloud points the cloud tracker are always inside your power window so you can choose to not use certain parts of it and finally don't forget you don't have to actually track the physical objects you're trying to track so when we did the door here we had a problem tracking it because the woman walks in front of it so what you can do is find something that's moving on a similar plane like this notice board up here track that the tracking data is then applied to the power window and then you can readjust the shape of the power window using in clip mode and the tracking data is stuck with that power window so it'll reapply to the new position and hopefully those tips will help you on the very rare occasion that resolve doesn't give you a perfect track
