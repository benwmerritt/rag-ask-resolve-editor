This is a $169 plug-in accessory that's available for Windows and Mac. There isn't yet any support for Linux. And it's designed to help speed up your workflow in photo and video editing software such as Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere Pro and of course DaVinci Resolve. But you can actually customise it to set up shortcuts for pretty much anything. Now TallBucks did send this to me free of charge but as always I'm not obliged to say anything and all opinions are entirely my own. Hmm. Well in this video I'm going to talk you through the construction, the layout, the setup and what it's actually like to use with DaVinci Resolve so you can make an informed decision for yourself. So a quick introduction, it comes with a bunch of presets for Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere Pro but it doesn't come with anything for DaVinci Resolve. You have to create your own preset which is what I have done which I'll cover in a moment. You can also import and export presets so if you did decide to pick one up I could simply export my preset, send it over and it will give you a good place to get started. Now I do actually use Lightroom and Photoshop myself but I haven't really tested the TallBucks with those. I've just stuck to using it with DaVinci Resolve which is what we're going to cover in this video. So with all that out of the way let's take a bit of a deep dive into this TallBucks shall we? Starting off with what you get in the box. Fortunately dead quick, dead easy, you get the TallBucks itself, you get a 5 foot braided USB type A to type C cable, you get some kind of naff feeling, carry cases, an instruction manual, a warranty and some other stuff and that's it. So onto the device itself and as you can see it's actually quite small but it is surprisingly heavy weighing in at about 400 grams. You can find that weight with these handy rubber feet, does mean that you've got a device which won't slip around on your desk too much which is nice. Now there's only one port on the device which is this USB type C port on the top left, this is what you use to connect the device to your computer. The outer shell is made of like a soft touch plasticine material, feels okay but it does show fingerprints, grease, dust all that sort of stuff really easily so it might get a bit grim over time. Now there are three assignable dials, we've got this one down here, this large one in the middle and then this one over in the top left. This one in the top left is also clickable and then we've got 11 customizable buttons dotted around the device but they can also be combined so you can do multiple key presses like so giving you roughly about 40 customizable shortcuts in total. On the initial inspection it does look like they sort of just dropped buttons and dials all over the place but actually there is some logic to it and it actually works surprisingly well. Drop your left hand onto your desk and fold it over, these keys sit nicely on the thumb, you've got access to the D-pad, all of the dial wheels come quite naturally and these two buttons up here and the shortcut one on the left. It is however a little bit cramped, I don't have the biggest hands in the world but if you have much bigger hands than me it is going to feel a little bit tight on space. Now as you can see pretty much every button with the exception of these two up here are a different size and shape which does mean that they are all quite easy to find and distinguish by hand which is good because it is all black on black here and there is no backlight end so it would be pretty difficult to see in a low light environment. There is also some additional nice touches like they have added a texture to this button here so it is a little bit easier to distinguish between these two. I would have liked them to do the same up here on these two little shortcut buttons, a little notch or dimple on one of them just to help distinguish when you are using your thumb would have been a nice little touch but overall it works surprisingly well. So while I struggled to remember exactly what each of the buttons did I learned the location of the buttons really really quickly which did surprise me. Now by default it definitely feels like it is designed for right handed users and by that I mean you use your mouse in your right hand and you use the tool box in your left hand. However because everything is customizable you could use it with your right hand if you are a lefty it would be a little bit of a different way of working but you could customize it to work without too many compromises the only thing that I think you would struggle with the most is getting over to this button on the left hand side. In terms of feel all the buttons have quite a nice click to them they give a decent amount of feedback without having too much or too little travel. Now this scroll wheel at the top here this is the clickable one this again feels quite nice it is quite well dampened it has a nice click and a bit of feedback to it. It feels like the scroll wheel from a relatively well sorted mouse. However these other two dials I am not as much of a fan of. They serve their purpose just fine however they are quite plasticky there is also a little bit of wobble in them especially this one in the middle and there is just very little weight or feedback. They don't spin freely as you can see but they don't really feel like they are attached to much more damping and a heavier feel would definitely be appreciated here. Overall a bit of a mixed bag it actually functions better than it looks. It looks a bit strange with the layout but as I say when your hands in place it actually feels quite natural and everything with the exception of these two spinning wheels here are actually quite nice to use. And there it is as I say a bit of a mixed bag but overall feels pretty good with just a handful of exceptions. So let's have a look at setup. Now setup is actually really easy you plug it in windows picked it up and then went to the toolbox website downloaded the console installed that that installed everything that I needed to and then I was able to get up and running it really is just a couple of minutes to do the entire process so there's nothing complicated about that at all and then once it's installed you can hop into the toolbox console which I'm going to talk you through right now. Once the toolbox console is installed you can open it up and it looks like this. So these are the default presets you get photoshop, lightroom, premiere edit and premiere color. To create your own preset it's dead easy you've got preset list up here you click on the little plus customised preset give it a name and then you create which is what I've done here for my DaVinci Resolve shortcut. Now you'll notice the resolve logo here because you can get it to auto switch presets depending on which application you've got open. You would just open DaVinci Resolve then you click on this icon it will show you the list of all the programs that you've got open you click on DaVinci Resolve and that links it so now whenever I open DaVinci Resolve it automatically runs this preset so it's really quick and really handy. And then to create a preset and start assigning shortcuts you just do so over on the right hand side here so you can see we've got all the different buttons listed down here and they show up on this image so they're easy to identify. Alternatively you can just hit the corresponding button on the toolbox itself and it will take you to the right area to assign a shortcut. So to assign them you just give it a click and then there's a list of options in here. Now these are shortcuts that I've created so you just enter the keyboard shortcut at the top here so you've got control, alt, shift and windows key you just enter whatever you need to do and then you give this button a click and you can give it a name. So I've already created a whole bunch you can see we've got things like copy and paste, mark, snap, cut, we've got zooms in, we've got nudges, razors, in and out points all that sort of stuff. Once you've created all the shortcuts you then just give the one that you want a click, click on okay and it assigns it to that button. So it's really really quite simple to do. So these are all the simple buttons if we click on this little drop down under each of the sections you can see you can also start to combine buttons. So again if we use this center dial as an example I can use it on its own or if I hold this left button and then the dial I can create a different shortcut to do a different thing and you can do that for all the different areas. So we've got the prime four section here which are our short, tall, top button and left button and we can double press them so we can assign different shortcuts for those or we can start to combine them as well. So you can see here you've got the option to create loads and loads of different shortcuts depending on how many you want. I actually find that to be too confusing at the moment that's too many things to remember so I'm not using most of them there's just a few which I'm making use of currently. Now by the looks of things there's no limit on how many presets you can create so you can create a preset for pretty much all of the different software or apps that you use. You can go to the toolbox website where people have uploaded their own presets so you can download those and start having a play. People have done them for all sorts obviously photo video editing but people have created them for Chrome web browsers all that sort of stuff so you really can have a plan to create shortcuts for anything really anything that you use keyboard shortcuts you could just assign to the toolbox so it's a really quite a handy little thing. Now that also includes games so if you play games where you use lots of keyboard shortcuts maybe you're playing World of Warcraft or League of Legends that sort of thing you could assign macros or keyboard shortcuts to this thing and you make a nice little device to sit by your keyboard and mouse you can just hit it and off you go. So food for thought you can create loads of different presets use it with loads of different stuff which is kind of cool but how does it actually work in DaVinci Resolve? Let's open DaVinci Resolve and take a look. So here we are with DaVinci Resolve from currently on the edit tab now because the toolbox is simply emulating keyboard shortcuts you can actually use it within any page within DaVinci Resolve you could even go as far as setting up separate presets for each of the different pages if you wanted to. I haven't done that I'm just sticking with the edit page for now. So here we are on the edit page I'm just going to give you an idea of how I've got mine set up so I use the toolbox in my left hand and then I keep my mouse in my right hand so I'll use my mouse to do big movements like just scrolling through the timeline like so then if I want to make any finer movements I'll put my playhead where it is and then I'll use this center dial so if I roll that right you just move the playhead to the right then move it left and I can move it to the left that'll do frame by frame if I move it slowly and then I can move it a little bit quicker as well. Once I've got it in a position where I want to make a cut I use this little button here with my thumb and that'll just make a quick cut and then if I want to delete I use this short button to the right just to do a ripple delete on the timeline. This little button on the left we're just doing it undo so if I deleted that accidentally we can just hit that to undo. Let's undo that cut as well. Now if I hold that side button and then use my center dial I can just jump between all the different cuts or markers that I've got on my timeline so again that's a nice quick way of making big jumps around my timeline. If I put my playhead in the middle of this clip here like so if I hold this left button and then use this tool and short again if I hit this tool what it'll do is make a cut to where the playhead is and then ripple delete the left side the rear side of the playhead like so if I just do that if I hold the side button and hit the short button here it'll do the same thing but deleting this right hand side. Now that's actually the main use for me of the toolbox at the moment it's just a real nice way of jumping around the timeline making cuts and ripple deletes really really quickly. So let's move on now to this dial up in the top left hand corner if I give that a click that will just play and pause if I just give that one notch upwards it'll play in real time then the more that I hit that upwards the faster it'll start playing through the timeline. If I click it in we can stop and if I roll it down it's just the same thing that plays backwards through the timeline. This button at the top here I've just got to play and pause at the moment because I couldn't think of a better use for it. Under this center dial we've got this little button here that just does a control s so a save so I'm going to save my project at any time. Let me just move my playhead onto this clip and then we'll use this lower left wheel. If you just rotate that I can just nudge clips left and right on my timeline like so. Now this is really useful because as you can see I've still got snapping turned on so if I was to use my mouse I could snap that left and right but if I wanted to make any final adjustments let's say to this section here I can click it so it's highlighted in green use this little dial just to make sure that cut is in exactly the right place so that makes a nice little use for it. We'll come back to the D-pad in a moment we're going to skip to the C1 and C2 shortcut buttons up here and they simply add an in and an out and then if I hold this tool button and use the same again I can clear the in and then clear the out. Let me just click on a new clip we'll just do a quick in and out and then I can use the left and right buttons on the D-pad the left will do a place on top while the right will do an insert so if I just do left it'll place that clip on top of the video track 1 so we've got it up here so we can do a nice quick cut away and if I just do right on the D-pad it will just insert it onto the video 1 track where the playhead is like so. So again adding new media I can do my in and out, my insert and my place on top. The up and down on the D-pad simply does a copy and a paste so I can just copy and paste footage around my timeline really quickly. Now for us to hold my side button I can use the up down left right buttons again but this time they do something different so if I hold the side button and hit down on the D-pad that'll take me straight into the color page and if I do the same thing again left it will take me back to the edit page. Left will take me into Fusion and right will take me to the deliver tab so again nice quick way of just skipping around the different pages within DaVinci Resolve and last but not least if I hold this little short button and use the C1 and C2 so I'm going to hold that down and hit C1 that will open up my project settings. If I hold that down hit C2 that will bring up my import media routine and that's all the shortcuts I've got set up at the moment and there you go as you can see it does work surprisingly well with DaVinci Resolve and if I'm totally honest I've actually enjoyed my time with Torbox way more than I thought I would I've really quite enjoyed using it. It feels relatively well put together and the layout which looks odd is actually quite nice to use. Installation was easy setup was relatively simple the customization continues to be pretty simple you can make tweaks to it nice and easily the software is regularly updated by Torbox which is always nice to see and in my experience it's been totally reliable it just sits in the system tray opens up with windows and then does its thing as soon as I jump into DaVinci Resolve. So do you need it in my opinion no absolutely not you can be really quite efficient with a keyboard and mouse however once you get over the learning curve you get over that initial frustration of switching to something new it can start to help it can feel really nice to use and in my opinion you can start to become faster it can improve your workflow because everything is a little bit quicker it's easier to find and it's way easier to remember a couple of buttons than it is a whole bunch of complicated keyboard shortcuts. Should you buy one well that's entirely up to you as to whether you think it will fit within your workflow. Also I don't think you should buy one now you should wait until the Blackmagic Speed editor has been released so you can have a more recon comparison between the two.
