What up folks? It's Alex here and this is number one in a new series of videos called Five Minute Fridays. Every Friday I'm going to release a new Five Minute video which teaches you how to do something new and interesting within DaVinci Resolve. Now this week, it's going to be this. That's how to do some basic face swapping using the stabilizer in DaVinci Resolve. It's just a bit of fun for number one to get things going. Now I'm Peter Griffin. Now this is actually surprisingly easy to do and once you know how to do this you can start doing the same thing with text and other things. So let's have a look shall we? So here we are in DaVinci Resolve and I've imported a clip in the same way that I usually would. Now when I also added the media to my project I added two PNGs. We've got Randy Marsh and we've got Peter Griffin. Now all we want to do is I'm going to grab Randy and I'm going to put him on video track number two. Now I want this right at the far side so I want it as far left as you can go to be at the start of the clip. I don't want to leave a gap here because then the time will be off. You can cut this later if you only want it to appear halfway through but for the time being you want it to be the same length as the clip that you're using. So I'm just going to drag this to about here and then I'm going to grab my Peter Griffin and put Peter Griffin there as well. Now at this point you can just adjust the sizes so I'm just going to use my transform icon here and I'm going to adjust the size of his head there and then the same with Peter. Actually I'm going to flip Peter as well. There you go. Happy with that. So we've got them roughly the right size and roughly the right place as wherever we'd want them. Now at this point what we need to do is turn these PNGs into a compound clip so I'm just going to highlight them both on the timeline. I'm going to right click and I'm going to create a new compound clip. You give it a name if you want to and then click create. Now because we actually need to do some work on the main video clip I'm just going to turn off video 2 so I'm going to click this icon here just to hide it to get out of the way. I'm just going to skimp back to the beginning of my clip and then I'm going to click on the color tab. Now this is the screen you'd usually use to do curves and to mess with your gain and your offset and all that sort of thing. Now what we actually want is this icon here which is the window. So give this icon a click and you'll be taken to this screen. Now what we need to do is highlight the area which we want Da Vinci to track. So in this case I'm going to use a circle. Just going to click this here and it'll drop something onto your preview. Now you can adjust the size as you usually would just by dragging so I'm going to make this roughly over my face. It doesn't need to be too accurate but get it generally right and you can rotate it if needs be. When you're happy you then need to click on this icon here which takes you to the tracker. Now you should see this page it should say window. If this says anything like stabilizer effects just click the drop down and make sure you're on the window. Now again make sure you're at the beginning of the clip so you just need to drag this to make sure you're as far left as you can be and then click the play icon which tracks forward. What you'll notice in the preview as it plays through everything within that circle within the oval which we placed on the screen will be tracked and that's what it's doing now. Now that tracking information will be displayed on this graph here. There we go that's done that's done a pretty good job and we've got the information on the graph. Now if you click on the ellipse here and then just click on the copy track data so we're copying this graph which is a visual representation of the movement within the clip. Now we need to get our compound clip back so I'm just going to go back to edit. I'm going to click on click on my video number two and I'm just going to bring that back in. Head back to color and you'll be back on this screen and you've now got the original clip and your compound clip on this timeline. Now make sure at this point you click and highlight the compound clip. Now the next step is to click on this window drop down and go to the stabilizer. Once here you need to click on your ellipse again you need to make sure you're on the classic stabilizer so give that a click. Now the next thing you need to do is to go down here and make sure that you type in strong this needs to be minus 100 and untick the zoom because we don't want it to do any zoom and we want this to be minus 100. The strong essentially is how much the stabilizer will compensate for the movement. We don't actually want it to compensate for the movement we want it to track it so we set this to minus 100 and then again into your ellipse and just click on the paste track data and what it would do is it'll paste that graph from the original video into the compound clip. Now if I hit play you notice it's not actually done anything. So I'm going to just go back and start here. What you need to do is just click on stabilize and what it will do is it'll apply that information to the compound clip. So now if I hit play the PNG will track all the movements of my face and because the compound clip actually has two PNGs in it at some point hopefully soon it should change to a bit of griffin. There it is and that's it. You can then go back to your edit and continue editing your video as normal and it's as easy as that. And there you go the first five minute Friday.
