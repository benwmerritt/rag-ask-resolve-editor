Vintage Texture. It's this sweet looking animated texture background thingy that you can have in black or white and you can use it for backgrounds, overlays, slideshows, infographics, stuff and of course title screens. And best of all, it's free and you already have access to it because this was actually added in DaVinci Resolve 19. It's a generator that's in both the free and studio versions so if you open up your version of DaVinci Resolve it will be there ready for you to have a play with. So we're on the edit page, we're going to open up the effects library, come down to generators, scroll down a wee bit until you get to the fusion generators. There's actually two new ones in here, there's comic speed lines which we'll cover in a separate video and of course we've got vintage texture. So all you need to do, drag it, pop it on your timeline. As a generator it will become a new thing, you don't need to apply it to an existing clip. And there you go, there is your animated vintage texture backgroundy thing. Now I really like this, I think it's quite a cool addition, it's a popular kind of technique, it's a popular style, you see people using it a lot these days so having a built-in generator is pretty neat. Now this sort of thing is also quite easy to generate so if you'd like more of these, let me know. Maybe I could make a video showing you how to do it or I could even create a pack that you guys can download. So yeah, maybe we can figure something out along those lines. Anyway, it's also customizable. To customize it, you know the drill, you give it a click on the timeline, you open up the inspector, top right hand corner, make sure you're on video, generator and then you'll see your vintage texture controls within here. If you don't see them, just click on the word vintage texture so they pop up like so. If we hit play you can see it sort of jumps around like so. We can change the animation scale and that's kind of the distance that it jumps around so we can have it really subtle or much crazier. We've got the texture size so we can zoom in or zoom out. I recommend that you don't play with this too much because if you zoom out you can start to see where the texture replicates and if you zoom in you do lose a little bit of the resolution so it starts to look a bit janky. So I generally keep it as it is. You can change the angle, you can mirror it or flip it either horizontally or vertically and you can change it from this dark texture to this light kind of paper texture instead. You've also got the flicker smoothness so there's a little bit of flickering in the background. You can change how kind of smooth or janky you want that. And then you can also set the flicker minimum and flicker maximum. Minimum being the darkest point within the flicker, maximum adjusting the brightest point of the flickering. So mess with those three to get the flickering looking just as you like them. Now here's a quick tip. Obviously by default it only comes in dark texture or light texture, black or white. But if you want to add some color to it, you can. Really quickly you just need to use another generator called the solid color. So we're back on the edit page. Now once again jump into the generators folder. Right near the top there is a solid color. So give that a click and pop that on your timeline and lengthen it out if required. Give that solid color a click, open up the inspector, generator, there's a color box and then you can simply change this to be whatever color you want it to be. We can come back to it as well in a moment to change it if we need to. But I'm going to go with a bit of an orange, something like that. Then back into the generators, scroll down, grab your vintage texture and just put that over the top of the solid color. Give it a click, back into the inspector. I recommend you just leave this one as the dark texture. Then this time jump over to this settings tab, scroll down until you get to the composite area and then you can either simply lower the opacity and then we get this texture sort of on top of the color or change this composite mode to something else. Now the easiest thing to do with this is just kind of scroll through. As you hover your mouse over each one you can preview it to see how it's going to look. That difference looks pretty cool, divides a bit more, exclusive, hard mix, hard light, that kind of work. So let's go with that. And then if we hit play we've got this cool effect. Then at any time you can just give your solid color a click once again, go back to the generator and we can change the color to see how that will look. Let's go with something like that and job done. And last but not least, you can actually use that vintage texture as well to apply that texture to videos or images on your timeline. This looks cool to just kind of de-age some video or if you want to make like an old, almost projector-ish style effect to any slideshows. And the technique is pretty much the same. We've got this video clip on our timeline track number one. So if we grab our vintage texture, put that on top and then if we lengthen it out, then if we give that vintage texture a click, go to the inspector settings, composite mode. Again, just have a little play with the different composite modes. If we go to add, it's just going to add this over the top and actually that looks pretty cool. But if you wanted to have a slightly different effect, again, just scroll down, scroll through, see the different composite modes, see what they do, pick one that you think looks good and off you go. Once again, you can always jump back into the generator, maybe try it with a light texture instead or change the animation scale, do what you need to do. And last but not least, for a kind of a background or a slideshow. So I've got some images on my timeline here because we want to use it as the actual background. For this one, we're going to grab our images, put them up a track, grab our vintage texture and put it underneath, lengthen this out. And then we've got that texture as the background. Let's say we want this to be the light texture, maybe brighten it up a bit. Of course, we can then go into the open effects and maybe grab a drop shadow, put that on there. So then it pops from the background. And if you want that texture to start coming through, once again, if you click on your image, go to the video, come down to your composite and maybe have a little play with some of the composite modes. Darker color seems to work and we just get some of that texture coming through onto the image as you can see. So have a little play and see what you can come up with. Something like that. I like this vintage texture. I think it's a nice addition. It's available right now for you to have a play with. So jump into your generators, give it a click, have a play and let me know what you think. Thanks for watching. Take it easy. I'll see you next time.
