This is the fastest way to make a good looking slideshow in DaVinci Resolve. There, I said it, I'm putting my neck out. This is the quickest way. This slideshow that you're looking at right now, I can knock up in one or two minutes, regardless of how long it is. I can create this really quickly, whether it's five images or 500 images. How simple. Tip number one, very first thing you need to do, resize your images. 4K in video terms is eight megapixels in photo terms. So if you're shooting on a 24 megapixel camera, which is pretty standard these days, those images are actually massive in video terms, and they will slow things down. They will make DaVinci Resolve chug, so resize your images. I tend to resize down to about 1080p because that's perfectly fine for what I like to do. To do so, if you're on Windows, I use something called Power Toys. It's by Microsoft. It's completely free to download. I've linked that down below. That's what I use. If you're on Mac, you can actually do it using the built-in image previewer. So just use that instead. Which you've resized them, we can hop into DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you the rest. So what's first? Well, first things first, click on DaVinci Resolve, top left-hand corner, and then go to Preferences. Make sure you're on the User tab at the top, editing from the left-hand menu, and then you're going to go down to this one here, Standard Still Duration. Make sure that the seconds little radio button is ticked, and then you've got seconds. So you can enter how long you want each image to be when you put it on your timeline. I found about four seconds. It seems to work well. You can always come back and amend it if you need to, but I'm going to go with about four seconds for now. So I'm done. I'm going to hit Save. Now, if I go to my media pool, I'm going to double-click on this image. This is as it looks at the moment. I want to resize it so it's a little bit smaller in the frame, but I want to do that to all of my images. So I've double-clicked this image so I can see it within my preview window here. Now that that's on there, it won't go away if I just single-click on any of the other images, which is perfect. So what I'm going to do, I can either hit Control and A to highlight everything, or I can just click my mouse and drag to highlight all of these images. Once they're highlighted, in the Inspector, top right-hand corner, I'm going to go to Zoom, and then I'm just going to zoom out a little bit. And that change will occur to all the images we have selected. So then I can just grab them all, drop them on my timeline. They're all exactly four seconds because we've already set that length, and they're all a little bit smaller in the frame. How easy was that? So now I want to add that nice little white border. That's easy, too. So I'm going to select this first image down here on my timeline. I'm going to right-click, and then I'm going to open in the Fusion page. If you're scared of the Fusion page, don't worry. We're only going to be on here for a second or two. Open up the Effects Library, top left-hand corner, Effects, Expand Templates, Expand Edit, and then click on Effects. Within this list here, go to the bottom, and you should see Effects, and you'll see Coloured Border. Grab that coloured border, click your mouse, hold, and then you're going to drag it onto this line here. You should see the line turn to this yellow and blue, Release, and then you'll get the white border around the image in the preview window like so. Now at the bottom of the page, you should see these. These are your clips. These are all your images. If you don't see your clips down here, just click on the word Clips up in the top left-hand corner to make sure that you can see those. So I'm going to select this next one. So it's highlighted in red. I'm going to hold Shift on my keyboard, select the last one. So they're all highlighted in red like so. Now using my middle mouse button, I'm just going to click my middle mouse button on this first one, the one that has the image effect applied. It's going to copy that coloured border to all of the individual images. So every single one has got this same border applied and job done. We'll hop back into the Edit page and let's have a look. They've all got the border on. So everything's the right length, everything's the right size, and everything's got the border. Without me talking, you can do that in literally seconds. It's super quick, super easy. So now let's just add a few additional things to jazz it up a bit. And the first thing we're going to do is that funky background using a blanking fill. So we're back now on the Edit page. I'm going to open up my Effects Library. I'm going to come down to Open Effects and just give that a click. And then from this long list, scroll again pretty far down until you get to this Resolve FX Stylize, and you want the second one down, Blanking Fill. This is available on the free and the studio versions. Give it a click, drop it on your first image like so. Make sure your playhead's over the first image so we can see what we're doing. Give it a click, open the Inspector, click on the little Effects tab, and then you should see Blanking Fill within here. If you don't see all of the options, just click on the word Blanking Fill to expand the list. Now I think there's a bit of a bug in here because if we expand Source, it always crops the left and the right just a tiny bit for no reason. So just drag those to the left to get rid of that cropping and now we've got our border back. Perfect. Now we do see the border on the actual blurry fuzzy background a bit, which we don't want. So underneath Source, you've got Fill Extent, and then you've got Zoom Mode. Change that drop down to be Manual, and then you've got Expand. Put that right to the right hand side. Now it only goes up to 2, and that actually doesn't fill the frame. But don't worry. Put your cursor over the actual number 2, and you'll see your cursor will change. Click your mouse, and then you can keep going past 2. Keep going, keep going until it fills the entire frame. We don't see the white border. We've got something that looks like that. Cool. Now I also like to add a drop shadow. So just underneath that, you've got Drop Shadow. I'm going to drag up the shadow strength, and we can change the angle and the distance, the blur, do all that sort of fun stuff if you want. So I'm going to go with something like that. So that's cool. We've applied that effect to this first clip. Now we need to apply it to everything else. So give that clip a click on your timeline. Use Control and C on your keyboard or Command and C. Highlight all of the other clips on your timeline just by clicking your mouse and dragging, and then use Alt and V, or Option and V if you're on a Mac. And this Paste attributes will appear. Tick this Plugins box down here. Give that a little tick, and then click Apply, and that will copy those settings to all of the images, like so. So straight away now we've got a pretty good looking slideshow. It just now needs a couple of finishing touches. First things first, transitions. So I'm going to highlight everything on my timeline, all of these images. We're going to go to the video transitions within the Effects Library, and then we can just pick any of the transitions we want to use. So if I wanted to use Arrow Iris, just for example, I'd just right click Arrow Iris, add to selected edit points and clips, and it'll add it to all of the clips that we've selected. So then you've got that going all the way through your slideshow. Super quick and super easy. But I actually want to customize that transition before we add it. So I'm not going to highlight anything, I'm just going to leave it as it is. I'm going to grab a cross dissolve, and I'm going to drop it onto this edit point here. I'm then going to give it a click, open up the Inspector, and then I can change the attributes for this transition within here. So I'm going to go to style, I'll change this to film, and I'm going to go to ease and change this to in and out. You have applied, just customize this as you want to. And now I've got something that looks like that, which I'm pretty happy with. And then on the timeline, actually right click on the transition, and you've got the option to create a transition preset. Give that a click. So I'm going to call this film fade, and then click on OK. I'm just going to delete this one off my timeline. Within the video transitions, scroll down. And now you'll see a user area with that transition you just created, film fade. So now if I highlight everything on the timeline once again, right click on film fade, add to selected edit points and clips, boom, we have a completely custom transition added to all of our different edit points. So now we just need to add one last thing to really add that additional little bit of polish. And that's a zoom in and out. In the effects library, click on effects, right at the very top, you should see an adjustment clip. Grab that and put it above your image track like so. Now I'm going to lengthen this out to be, just for this example, three images long, you can customize this as you wish. I'm going to give the adjustment clip a click, I'm going to open up the inspector, and then I'm going to toggle on this dynamic zoom, and then just hit play and see what this looks like. So now I've got this slow sort of zoom out. And that's going to work across all of the images that are underneath our adjustment clip. If you want to customize the dynamic zoom, underneath your preview window, you've got this little drop down here, go to dynamic zoom, and then you'll get these red and green boxes. The green box is your starting position, the red is your end position. So if you wanted to zoom out a little bit slower, which kind of make the green box a bit bigger, hit play. And there we go, we've got this nice zoom out. So now if I hold the alt key, click on the adjustment clip, drag, I can make a duplicate of it, and then we can just repeat that onto our timeline. But there's a problem. If I hit play, we're going to get a little bit of a jerk here. All I do on this second adjustment clip, give it a click, in the inspector dynamic zoom, hit swap. And what that means is this first dynamic zoom here is going to be zooming out, whereas the second one is going to be zooming in, which means you get a real seamless switch between the two. And now it doesn't matter how long your slideshow is, let's just do loads of them like so. I can just highlight these two adjustment clips, hold alt, click, drag, click, drag. I can have this seamless in and out going all the way through my entire slideshow. Drop some funky music on there.
