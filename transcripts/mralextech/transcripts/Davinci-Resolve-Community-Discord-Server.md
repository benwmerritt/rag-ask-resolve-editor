It's Alex here and welcome to 5 minute Friday. So what's this video all about? Well, J.K. the guy you just saw a second ago. He's actually taken the time to create a community DaVinci Resolve Discord server for all of us to use. So if you don't know what Discord is, Discord is primarily used by gamers a lot of the time. It's a place where you can set up communities for everyone to join to get to know each other. We can just have general chat a bit of banter and all that sort of thing. But there's also loads of different help channels. So if you've got a question you need answering, you can hop onto the Discord server, ask it in the Fusion channel, Fairlight, Edit page, Cut page. You want help buying a new piece of kit or some hardware for your PC or you're looking at new cameras, whatever it may be. You can ask your questions and hopefully get them answered much quicker by using the Discord server. And here it is. This is the DaVinci Resolve Community Discord. So a real quick overview. On the left we've got all of the different channels. So we've got some announcements and then you've got your text channels. So here's where we just have general conversations. This is the general conversation at the moment. I'm in there making terrible jokes. To add a comment, you simply click on your message box at the bottom, type it out to add a comment in there. We've got Share Your Work. So if you've created something cool and creative within DaVinci Resolve, you can share it and discuss it in there. There's also some help channels. So if you've got issues, any of the media page, cut page, fusion, color, you can just ask in there and hopefully someone can help you out. But then underneath here, we've also got these voice channels. General is for general chat. And then we've got a couple of help rooms as well. So if you're really stuck, we can hop in there. You can share your screen with us. We can see what you're doing and hopefully someone will be able to help you out. Over on the right hand side, you can see all the different members. There's quite a few members in here already. There's nearly 300 members total. And you can see the YouTubers section. There's all of us, YouTuber folks within there. And that's it. That's the DaVinci Resolve Community Discord. It's much easier as a big collective to be able to help each other out rather than relying on one or two individual people. So head over to the Discord server. It's linked down in the description below. The original video by Jake Whip is also down there. So he talks about it in a little more detail so you can shoot over there and have a look at that as well. All of the guys you've just seen are in there. So obviously there's myself. There's Sadi from Goggles at Work. There's William Justice. There is CB Super. There's Jake Whip, of course, as he created it. And then there's John's Films. On top of that, Billy Ripka likes to pop in every now and again. We've got Jay Littman in there as well. And Jamie Fenn. So there's a whole wealth of knowledge and expertise in there just from the YouTuber side of things. But there's loads of other people in there that are really knowledgeable and all there to lend a hand if you need it. So click on the link down in the description. Pop a link into the Discord server. Say hello. Have a read some things. If there's anything that you can help with, obviously help people out. And if you need help, pop a question in there and hopefully you'll be able to get it answered. So that's it. I hope you find it useful. I've been on there a little bit already and I'm having loads of fun and it's great to get to know people and to answer a few questions. It's a little bit easier from our perspective, from us YouTuber guys perspective, to answer everything on there rather than via Instagram and that sort of thing. So hop on into it, say hello, and hopefully you find it to be a really useful resource. And that's it for this video. Take it easy, thumbs up, subscribe, all that other good stuff. And I'll see you next time. See you, folks.
