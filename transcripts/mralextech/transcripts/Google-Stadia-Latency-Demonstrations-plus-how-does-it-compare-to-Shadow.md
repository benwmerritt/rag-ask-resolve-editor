What up folks, it's Alex here. Now with the introduction of Google Stadia, Cloud Gaming has officially hit the mainstream. Now we don't actually know a huge amount about Google Stadia, but from the announcement presentation, it looks like it's a relatively closed system more akin to consoles than to PCs. Now as soon as you start talking about Cloud Gaming, the first question that springs to everyone's mind is latency. Now fortunately, the guys over at Digital Foundry have had a hands on with Google Stadia and they've been able to run some latency tests. So in this video, I'm going to give those numbers a little more context and put those results against the Cloud Gaming system I've been in for the past few months, which is called Shadow. Shadow is a cloud-based Windows 10 PC you access over the internet. It's a full desktop experience and you can install all your own apps, programs and games. So they're two very different systems, but they're both cloud-based, so I figured I'd pit them head to head in some latency tests. So here are the figures from the Digital Foundry video. As you can see on the left, Google Stadia recorded a end-to-end latency of 166 milliseconds. The same game running on a PC, recorded in latency of 100 milliseconds and the Xbox One was 166 milliseconds. For my tests, I also use a SES and screen odyssey. I filmed my screen at 120 frames per second and I mapped dodge to be the caps lock key so I could count the number of frames between the light coming on and the first action appearing on screen. We know that each frame is eight milliseconds so we can times the number of frames by eight to figure out the actual latency in milliseconds. I used a Surface Pro laptop running Shadow that was connected via Wi-Fi and as a second additional test, I used Shadow's own proprietary thin client called the Shadow Ghost, which was connected to an external display and connected to the internet via ethernet. And here are the clips showing the 10% speed. I performed the test five times for each device and then averaged out the results to give us our overall latency. Now I'm showing you all of the tests because I figured someone's gonna call me out so at least you can see these for yourself. The time code is at the top so you could slow this video down and count the frames yourself. Sometimes seeing things in slow-mo can make things look far worse than they actually are. So here's a couple of examples of the exact same clips shown in real time. And here are the results. The Surface Pro averaged 159 milliseconds while the Shadow Ghost recorded 127 milliseconds. So how do they compare? Well, the Chromebook running Stadia recorded 166 milliseconds, the Surface running Shadow was 159 milliseconds and the Shadow Ghost was 127 milliseconds. Now the fairest comparison is between Stadia and the Surface. Both the laptops using that in-built displays and both were on Wi-Fi. Now the difference is negligible. The seven milliseconds difference between the two. A single frame at 60 hertz is 16 milliseconds. The Shadow Ghost on the other hand was a full 40 milliseconds faster than Stadia. That in my opinion is an argument for proprietary hardware as well as the fastest monitor you can get and using Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi. And here's a real quick gameplay clip just to show you some movement in the game. This was being played on the Shadow Ghost connected via Ethernet. And as you can see, I was using the Xbox controller. So if you're currently a console gamer and you play a lot of games with a controller on your PC and you're intrigued by Stadia but you're worried about the input latency, from these results, I don't think there's too much to worry about. Shadow works really, really well. And if Stadia is matching Shadow, then Stadia will work really well as well. But what about keyboard and mouse? I hear you cry. What about keyboard and mouse first person shooters or specifically? Well, I've done another quick test to demonstrate that as well. And for this one, we used Apex Legends and we used a keyboard and mouse. The bottom window is Apex Legends running natively on my own PC. Top left is a small Intel PC running Shadow that's connected via Ethernet. And the top right is the Shadow Ghost, again connected via Ethernet. So first up in real time, the difference is barely noticeable. If we slow that down to 25% speed, you can start to see the small difference between them. And then if we slow that down to 10% speed, you can see that the local PC is fastest with the Ghost in second and the Intel PC coming in third. And here are the results. A local PC came in at 69 milliseconds, my Ghost was 119 milliseconds and the Intel Atom mini PC was 140 milliseconds. To give those numbers a little more context, here's what 64 milliseconds looks like. 112 milliseconds and 144 milliseconds. And here they are all at the same time. If you want to know more, I've actually made a separate video on Counter Strike Go running on Shadow. Within the video I perform similar tests and show plenty of gameplay footage. So check it out. Now first person shooters with a keyboard and mouse do feel different. They feel slower and they feel heavier. I personally never feel disconnected from the game but you certainly can tell the difference. If you're a high level FPS shooter and you really love the twitchiness and the speed you get with a keyboard and mouse, then a cloud based solution isn't for you. If you're like me and you dabble with some first person shooters but you don't take it too seriously and you also play a lot of third person games like Tomb Raider or the Division, some RTS games, maybe some driving games and you have decent reliable internet that really, really is key. Then a cloud based solution is genuinely worth considering. Should you buy a Shadow or should you wait for Stadia? As I said at the beginning, they're two entirely different products by the looks of things. Stadia is to replace a games console whereas Shadow is to replace a PC. I use my Shadow to do much more than just gaming. I use it for general browsing as well as photo and video editing. It is in my opinion a more complete package but it's also a little bit more niche. There's a link down below so go have a look if you want to know more. There's also a discount code which will get you 10 pounds off your first month. And that's it. If your video was useful, give me a thumbs up. If you've got any comment or feedback, I'll comment below. And don't forget to subscribe for more good stuff. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. See you. Bye guys.
