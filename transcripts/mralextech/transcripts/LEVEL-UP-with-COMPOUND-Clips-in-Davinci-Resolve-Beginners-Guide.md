What if I told you there was a feature within DaVinci Resolve which I use in pretty much every single project? A feature which can help keep your timeline tidy which of course makes for faster and easier editing. Helping you to create great looking face cams in a jiffy, animate multiple things quickly and easily, and even allow you to create some really cool effects with very little effort at all. Well what magical feature is it I talk of? It's the simple compound clip. Never heard of them? Well, let me explain. But first I just need to let you know about this video's sponsor, Squarespace. The all-in-one solution for creating a website and running an online business. So what is a compound clip? Well simply put, a compound clip is like a little box or a little container on your timeline which you can just use to put things in to make your life a little bit easier. So how exactly do they work? Well check out my timeline here. I've got a PNG, a title, and then a solid color. Now of course if I wanted to move them I could highlight them but it'd be really easy for me to accidentally misalign them or move one without the other or something like that. So instead we can turn them into a compound clip. To do it all you need to do, highlight the things that you want like so. So I've got all three highlighted, right click, and then from the menu that pops up, the top option, new compound clip. You'll be asked to give it a name so I'm just going to call this Mr. Alex Tech Logo and then hit create. And then on your timeline you'll see we've got a Mr. Alex Tech Logo Compound Clip and I can just move this one single clip wherever I want. Now it's also important to note that in my timeline I now have this. This is a Mr. Alex Tech Compound Clip. We know it's a compound clip because it's got this little icon in the bottom left hand corner. I can delete this from my timeline but my compound clip will still stay within my media pool so I can grab it at any point and bring it down onto my timeline and it's got all of my three individual elements. The background, the title, and the logo. But can you edit it? Yeah, you can. You can open your box up at any time, put more stuff in it, take stuff out of it, or just rearrange it. Either on the compound clip on the timeline itself or within your media pool, simply right click and then you've got the option to open in timeline. Give that a click and then you'll open up a new timeline. This is inside our box. This is inside a compound clip. So from here we can do whatever we want. If I wanted to change this logo, let's zoom this in, move this around. We just treat it like any other timeline. We could add some more stuff so let's just move this up. Let's go grab another title, we'll just bring this in, we'll leave that there, maybe move this over. Do whatever we want to this compound clip. Now to get back to our main timeline at the bottom, you've got basics, which is the name of my timeline and then Mr. Alex Tech logo. I'm going to double click on the timeline name so yours may just be timeline one. And that's going to take us back to the timeline itself. But if you have a look at compound clip, my logo has got bigger and it's got the new title on it. But then what can you do with it? Well, once you're back onto your timeline, you can treat it as one single clip, which means you can add transitions to it, which will affect everything within the compound clip. You can transform it, you can color grade it, you can even open it up into fusion. So here's my compound clip and let's just use the inspector. So I'm going to zoom this out and rather having to juggle all the individual elements, I'm just zooming out the entire thing, the background, all the titles and the logo. So I can just put it wherever I want. If I wanted to drop shadow on this, I could just open up my open effects from my effects library. I'm going to find my drop shadow. We can drop that on there just once. And now we've got a nice drop shadow on a compound clip. Awesome. But what if you want to get rid of it? Well, you can do that too. Again, it's really quick and easy. If for whatever reason you want to get rid of your compound clip and get all the individual elements back, simply right click on the compound clip on your timeline. You've got the option to decompose in place using clips only. And that'll just restore that back to all the individual elements on the timeline. Now, the handy thing with this, if we have a look in our media pool, I've still actually got my Mr. Alex Tech logo compound clip. So I can still add that to any other part of my timeline as I need to. But are there any downsides? Well, there's one thing which kind of lets these compound clips down just a little bit, which I'll cover at the end of this video. But before we do, let's hop in and have a look at some really great examples of how to use these compound clips to make your life just a little bit easier. So this is quite a simple example. We've got this. We've got four layers. We've got PNG, text, an image and a background, just to warn people of the scammers which are in my comment section. Now, I want to move this around. I want to be able to use this multiple times throughout the same project. So again, rather than having to select all the things individually, if we just highlight them all, right click, compound clip. We'll call this warning. Now, we've got this real tidy warning clip rather than four individual things. And if I hold the Alt key, give it a click to make a duplicate. I can just put this wherever I want on my timeline really quickly and easily so it pops out whenever we need it. Now, quick note about transitions. I've got that compound clip there. If I was to grab a transition, try and put it on the end, I can't. It's just going to go on the inside. I can't put it in the middle. And that's because we haven't got any handles. But all you want to do, right click on your compound clip, open it up in the timeline, and then all we're going to do here, make everything longer than we need it. So I'm just going to lengthen this out like so. We're going to go back to our timeline. We can go back to our warning now. Then I'm going to grab my trim edit tool just by clicking on this icon or I'm going to hit T on my keyboard, roll the clip forward. It doesn't actually matter because it's all exactly the same. That just gives us this handle on the edges so now I can grab a transition, put it on there, no worries whatsoever. We'll move this one over. Job done.

Next up, a simple face cam. So sticking with this same compound clip, I've got a new timeline here. I don't want to put a face cam over in the right-hand side, but I want to jazz it up, give it a border, drop shadow, all that sort of fun stuff. So I'm going to grab my video, put this on top, and at the moment it's just covering the entire thing like so. Now what we want to do is just turn this into a compound clip. So I'm going to right-click, compound clip, and we'll call this face cam. We're then going to right-click again, and we're going to open in timeline. So what we're going to do with this, give it a click in the effects library, go to effects, grab a colored border, and we're just going to drop that on our face cam like so. Open up the inspector, go to the effects tab, and then we can just change the color to be whatever we want it to be. I'm going to go with a gray, like so. Perfect. So we've got a face cam with our border applied. We're then going to jump back to our main timeline. So I'm going to go back to my timeline three by double-clicking. Then we can give a compound clip a click. Using the inspector tools, we can simply transform, resize this, relocate it, put it in the corner like so. It's already got our border on it because our border is actually within the compound clip itself, and job done. I want to have a drop shadow on there, so I'm simply going to go back to our open effects, find my drop shadow, drop that on our compound clip, and job done. If we wanted to, we could animate this in as well. So I'm going to go to my video transitions. Let's just find the push transition, which is a great one to use. We'll pop this on my compound clip. Give it a click in the inspector. I'm going to use the push right, change the ease to in and out. Remember if you're using transitions, if in doubt, in and out. And now if we hit play, we've got our face cam, pings in from the side with our drop shadow and our border. Easy peasy, done. Next one, moving and animating multiple things in one go. This is a lifesaver for me whenever I do any of my techie laptop style videos. So I've got this B roll of this laptop, and we've got a slow little pan. And then I've got three little text boxes with all the computer specs. Now I've had to do is three separate ones because I want different sizes, this, that and the other. And I want to be able to organize it to get it looking exactly as I like it. So what do we do here? Well, simply highlight all three of the text boxes, right click, and we're going to create a new compound clip. I'll call this one specs. And there we go. Now it's all in one little bundle. So what we're going to do, give it a click in the inspector once again, in the transform, I'm just going to add a key frame at the beginning because that's in the right place. We're going to use our play head to go to the end of the clip. I'm going to just change my position to about there. Now, if it goes to the beginning, a hit play, all three of my titles will be moving in line with my laptop to give it a real nice almost motion tract effect. And we've done it all in one go. Thanks to that compound clip. Simple. What about something a little bit more creative? We can actually create a really funky looking Polaroid effect using the paper generator. I actually made a whole video about paper generators up here, but let me show you really quickly how to use a compound clip to make one of those. So we've got this image here. We want to look like a sort of Polaroid style thing. So we're going to right click, new compound clip, give it a name Polaroid. We're going to right click and we're going to open in new timeline. Now, what I want to do for this, I'm going to move it up a track. We're going to zoom out a little bit, give us a bit more room. Then from within the effects library, we're going to go to generators, going to scroll down and grab my paper from the fusion generators area and put it underneath like so. And then we're very quickly just going to hop into the inspector and go to cropping. And we're going to crop this so it looks almost like a Polaroid. We're going to do this really rough. We'll go something like that, trim it down from the top as well. There we go. That looks about right. Now we can jump back to our main timeline. Let's just put something underneath so we can see exactly what we're doing. Now we've got this cool looking Polaroid effect. We're just going to give it a click in the inspector. Let's just zoom it out a bit, rotate it a little bit or move it over to the side. Once again, I'm going to go to my open effects or drop a drop shadow on there. And there you go. We've got a really nice, simple looking Polaroid effect in no time at all using a compound clip. Next one, speeding up multiple clips. So I've got this clip of me and I've got a timer going in the top right hand corner. But I want to speed everything up because it's currently in real time. So how do we do this? We highlight it all, right click, new compound clip, give it a name. And now that's all bundled in one. We don't even need to open it up this time. We're simply going to give it a click in the speed change area within the inspector. Let's set this to 500%. And as you can see, it's not just my footage that's sped up. It's also the timer sped up the exact same amount. So it's really great way of doing time lapses, timers, speed runs, anything like that. And for my next one, I heard you'd like transitions. So I'm going to put your transitions on your transitions, nested transitions. So I've got these two clips here on my timeline and I'm just going to drop a transition on there. So I'm going to use the built in circles one from the fusion transitions within the video transitions. And we're going to drop that on there like so. And now we've got this transition. Then make sure your playhead is right on that edit point there. So right in the middle, like so. Then we're going to highlight it all, right click, new compound clip, give it a name if needs be. Like so. Then make a cut using a control B shortcut in the exact same point. So now we've got them cut once again. And now we can drop another transition on there. So now I'm going to drop a drop warp. So now we've got the circles with a drop warp effect as well. If you wanted to do it again, playhead right in the middle, highlight, right click, compound clip, create, cut. Let's go find another one like camera shake. And now we've got the circles, the drop warp and the camera shake, all the transitions in one go. Giving us something that looks like that. So how great are they? So what's the negative? But the only real negative with compound clips is the fact that you can't unfortunately save them into power bins, which means they're not easily shared amongst projects. It would be great if you could save a compound clip to a power bin. So it's always there ready to pull off and drop on your timeline. But unfortunately, you can't do it just yet. Hopefully Blackmagic make a change to the virtual resolve so that you can do that in the future. But other than that, I think they're bloody marvelous. So let me know what you think down in the comment section below. Take it easy.
