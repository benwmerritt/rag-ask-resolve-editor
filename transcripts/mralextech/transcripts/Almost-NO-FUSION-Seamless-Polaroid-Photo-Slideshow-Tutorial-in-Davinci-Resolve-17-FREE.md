Now, what up, folks? Alex here, Mr. Alex Tech. Now, I'm going to be doing this in DaVinci Resolve 17. I believe pretty much all of it, or at least most of it will work if you're using an older version like DaVinci Resolve 16. It will also work on the free version as well as the studio versions of DaVinci Resolve. Now, before we actually get into the tutorial, I've got something really important that I think you should do. Resize your images. Don't just import your images from your camera into DaVinci Resolve to try and do this because it's really, really going to chug. For this demonstration, I've resized all of my images to just 1080p. So basically, I've made the widest edge, 1920 pixels. They work perfectly fine. They're much easier to use in DaVinci Resolve. And if you are, I'm not even going to notice they're still going to look really nice and crisp. Anyway, I use a piece of software called Photoscape. It's completely free. No affiliation is just what I've used forever. But if you have a look on Google, just search for free photo resizer, you'll be able to find some apps or websites that do it completely for free in no time at all. But I do highly recommend doing that because you'll have a much better time doing this tutorial in DaVinci Resolve with smaller images. And talking of images, all of the images that I've used for this demonstration, including the backgrounds were from Pexels, Pixabay, or Unsplash. They're all linked down in the description below. You can go check them out. To find the backgrounds, I just typed things like background, white wall, paper, texture, just try and find a relatively clean, uniformed background with just a little bit of texture. We're actually going to just try and match these up to replicate it so it looks infinite. So you don't want anything with colored borders or vignettes and that sort of thing. You want something nice and plain, like I'm using in this demonstration here. Right, with all that out of the way, let's open up DaVinci Resolve, get cracking, and I'll show you what to do. So here we are in DaVinci Resolve. Now these are the backgrounds that I've selected. As you can see, they are all nice and plain, nice and uniform. There's no sort of vignettes or dark edges. So we should be able to line these up nicely. This is the one I'm going to use. I just really like the texture of it and I think it'll work really well. Now you'll notice that's in portrait. I want it to be landscape. There's a quick trick that you can do you may not be aware of. Right click the image within the media pool, go to clip attributes, make sure you're on the video tab and you've got image orientation. I can just change that to be 90 degrees to the right, click on OK. And now that's a landscape image. So I can just drag it onto my timeline like so. I don't have to worry about rotating it manually once it's on there. And then all I'm going to do, give it a click once it's on my timeline, I'm going to zoom in. So it fully fits my frame. And then I'm just going to extend this out a little bit like so. Now I'm going to move my playhead forward a few seconds. So I want each of my sort of images to be on screen for just a couple of seconds. I'm going to go with three, feel free to experiment with this, mix it around. Depends what works for you. But I'm going to go with three seconds. And then I'm just going to do a control and B on my keyboard. So we're cut on this background image. Then we're going to open up the effects library. We're going to come down to video transitions. We're going to scroll down until you get to the push video transition. We're going to drag that and we're going to apply that onto this edit point like so. And then we're going to lengthen it out. I like these again to be quite long. Anything between two, three, four seconds seems to work well. Let's go with four. Give it the transition and click so it's highlighted in red. Open up the inspector, go to the transition, and there's a few options you need to change in here. I'm going to give you the things that I've used, but you can experiment with these. Just tinker, have a play, see what works best for you. So the first thing first, you've got this preset. So you've got push left, right, up, and down. And really simply, this is the way that we're going to be pushing. And so there you've got border and you've got feather. So I like to tick feather and just increase this a tiny bit. I want to say a tiny bit. I mean, about 20. There's not much at all. I'd just like to add a tiny bit of border on there. I like to do the same for motion blur. So I'm going to go with about 0.1. I don't like too much once again, but just a little bit really solves the effect. We've got the ease that's currently set to none. So change that to be in and out. And then if we hit play, we've got something that looks like this. It's working with burnt. You can still see this real obvious line right down the middle. So what I'll do is I'll put my playhead right in the middle on this edit point so we can see this line. Click on your second part of your background. So over on the right here, still within the inspector, go to video. And all I like to do is experiment with these flips. So first one, I'm going to click on this one on the left to flip it horizontally. And now we can see that it's just mirrored. That kind of works, but it's quite obviously mirrored. You can really see that it's replicating it. So we're going to click on the next one as well. So if that looks any better. And that actually works really, really well. You can barely see that there's any sort of cuts there at all. Now, because we had to zoom in a little bit on our image, we can also just play with the positioning left and right just a little bit to get it looking perfect. I'm going to go with something like that. And actually, I think that works really well. This is why it's so important to have a relatively basic uniform textured image for your background. It just makes lining things up, making it look seamless, much, much easier. So now if we go back and hit play, it looks like that. You can maybe tell that it's a join if you're really looking for it. But most people probably wouldn't notice, especially when we've got some nice images on there to distract them. So now we can start to add our images. So I've got my pictures folder in my media pool. I've got my images here. They've all been resized. So I'm going to grab this one and just drop it on my timeline. I'm going to trim it down. You just want it to be at the same edit point. I'm going to give it a click, I'm going to zoom out, and then I can just resize it. I can change the angle. I can do whatever I want to get this image in the right position. Now there's a couple of other things you can do to these images to really sell this entire effect. If you go to your effects library, scroll down to open effects, scroll down within open effects until you get to the stylized area. There's a drop shadow drop that on your image. It just puts this really nice little drop shadow on there. It pulls it away from the background. It's just a really nice simple effect, which can look really, really nice. Now the other one I like to do is a nice white sort of border gives you almost Polaroid style effect. Now there are a few different ways to do this. This is the easiest way I found it does involve going into fusion, but don't panic. It's super quick and super easy. Just right click the image, open in fusion. It'll take you into fusion like so. Make sure that you can see your nodes down here by clicking on nodes and make sure that you've also got your effects library open within that effects library, expand templates, expand edit, and then click on effects. Third one down, you've got colored border. Just click that and drop it onto this line. So you can see at the moment the line is yellow. Hold it in my mouth. I'm going to drop it on there until it goes yellow and blue and release. That's just going to put a nice white border on our photo. We can open up the inspector and we can change the edge, the width, the color, everything for that border if we want to. So I'm going to make it a bit thicker. Once we're done, we can just hop back into the edit tab and that's still got our drop shadow on, but it's got that real nice little border on as well. Now I'm going to move my playhead forward. So we're on to the next section and then we're going to do the same thing. I'm going to grab a different image this time. We'll drop this on here. We'll resize this one. I'm going to keep this one right in the middle because it's a nice wide image. I'm going to add the border again. So I'm just going to go to fusion, drop my colored border on there. And there we go. That's looking pretty cool. So we've got our two images set up ready to go. So now we just need to animate them to follow the background. And this bit, once again, super duper easy. Click on this transition, the one that's set up on your background. So it's red as you can see mine is hold the alt key on your keyboard, drag up and then release. And you'll make a duplicate of that exact transition. And now if I just hit play, because the transitions are identical, they're going to get the exact same time and they're the same length. Everything moves together. And it gives us that look of our infinite seamless canvas. And it looks really, really cool. Now you can do the exact same thing with text. So I'm going to go to my titles within my toolbox, grab text, I'll put that on here. And let me do this really quick. Let me just say Mr. Alex Tech. Let's make it black. We could choose a font, we could do whatever we wanted to do. We'll move this over here. Now if I tried to apply that transition just by holding alt and dragging up, it wouldn't work because I can't actually have the overhang over here. So what I'll do, click on the text, hold alt once again to drag over, make a duplicate. Same as you did for the transition, but for the text, hit D on your keyboard with this one selected just to deactivate it. But it gives something on the timeline to be there. And then I can duplicate this transition up like so. And then if we hit play, Mr. Alex Tech will follow along as well. Get swept out of the way. This is disabled. So we can't see anything anyway. And there we go. It's good to go. Now let's just skip ahead. And we're going to do the same thing here. So I'm going to do a cut. Because we want to go on to our next one. I'm going to grab a next image. We'll put this one down here. Let's resize this one. Let's go with two this time. So I'm going to move this one over here. I'm going to grab a portrait one. And we'll zoom out this one as well and move this one over here. Something like that. I won't add the effects this time. I'm showing you how to do that. But I'll just put them there. I'm going to give this one a click, hold Alt, drag it over. So it's there ready to go. And then going to give it a click in the inspector. I don't want to push left again. So this time we could push right, we could push up or down. Let's go with up and see how it looks. That sort of working. But we can see that line there. So I'm going to give my background my right hand background a click. We'll go to video. Let's try and untick one of these. See if they look any better. That looks better. You can tell it's mirrored, but it doesn't look too bad. We could move it up and down to try and just. There you go. I think that looks pretty good. And then if we were to hit play, we'll ignore these photos for now. The background is working really seamlessly. So that's cool. And then we can just drag it up. Hold Alt, drag up, hit play. There we go. That's all working really well. Now there's actually a few other small things which you can do to really help sell this effect. The first one, some people might like, some people might not, but I'm going to show you anyway, because it's really quick and easy to do. If you want to add a little bit of extra movement, just zoom in onto your timeline. And then this transition that's on the background, not the one on the images, just the background, just make it slightly shorter, just the tiniest bit like so. And now what happened is the images or the text will start moving first, then the background will start moving afterwards. The background will get into place first, and it just gives this little bit of slide, this little bit of additional movement to the image and can actually look really quite nice. It gives it an almost 3D sort of look. Now the next tip I really like, I think it makes a huge difference, grab an adjustment clip from the effects library and the effects area, so adjustment clip here, drag this onto your timeline and put it above the transition. Make the adjustment clip the same length as those transitions, like so. Grab your playhead, put it at the beginning of the adjustment clip. In the inspector, in the video tab, next to zoom, click on this little icon to add a keyframe. Move your playhead to the very middle, so on the edit point, the middle of the transition, do a little bit of a zoom in. You don't need to do too much, about 1.1 ish seems to work well for me. And then grab your playhead to the end, double click on zoom to reset that to 1. And now we've got this effect where we zoom in, as we transition in the cross, and then we zoom out again towards the end, just adds a nice little bit of additional movement. If you want to smooth that out, give the adjustment clip a click, make sure you nicely zoomed in on your timeline, so the adjustment clip is quite big, like so. Click on this icon here. You should hopefully have zoom listed here underneath the word adjustment clip. Click on the drop down if you don't, just make sure to click on either zoom x or zoom y. Click on this middle keyframe, and then click on this icon here, and it'll just smooth that out, giving it a much nicer curve, and it just makes the whole animation look a tiny bit smoother. Now one very last thing to show you, with that same adjustment clip, you can also mess with the pitch, which is for ups and downs, and then the yaw for left and right. So I'll do the exact same thing. I've moved my playhead to the very beginning, add a keyframe for the yaw, because for this one, we're moving over to the left. In the middle, we can adjust our yaw. So I'm going to do a bit of a yaw. Again, let's not go too mad. Let's go with about 0.1. Then we're going to go over to the end and reset that. And again, if we wanted to, we could just expand the curves, untick, zoom, make sure we're on the yaw, and then smooth that keyframe out a little bit. And if we hit play, we've got that nice 3D effect as the camera sort of leans over, zooms in, moves across the canvas, and then displays the next image. Now the great thing about that, once that's done, same thing again, give a click on your timeline, hold the alt key, drag across to the other edit point, which is here. The zoom's already there. Yaw is wrong, so I'm just going to give the adjustment clip a click. Next to yaw, I'm going to click this icon just to reset the yaw, get rid of all of those keyframes. This one would need pitch instead, so keyframe at the very beginning, keyframe in the middle, add a bit of pitch, go to the end, reset it, hit play, and we've got this nice bit of pitch on there as well. Boom, and there you go. Done. Thanks for watching. Take it easy. I'll see you next time. Bye.
