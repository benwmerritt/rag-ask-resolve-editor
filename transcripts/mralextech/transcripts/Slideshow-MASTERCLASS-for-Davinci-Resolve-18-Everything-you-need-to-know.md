Here's a bunch of tips to help you become a Sly Joe master in DaVinci Resolve 18. Using these tips, you'll be able to create Sly Shows that look like this, like this, and even this, and you'll be able to do it really quickly and really easily. So let's open DaVinci Resolve and take a look. Default Image Length. The first thing you're going to want to do is to set your default image length. This is how long each image appears on your timeline as soon as you drag it in from your media pool. It's really quick and easy to change and you can go back and change it whenever you want. Within DaVinci Resolve, simply click on the word DaVinci Resolve top left hand corner and then go to Preferences. When this window appears, make sure you're on the user menu at the top and then from the options on the left, select Editing. And then from these general settings down here, you've got Standard Still Duration. You can set seconds or you can change it to frames. I'm just going to leave it to four seconds and then I'm going to hit Save and job done. Now a quick tip with this, I generally air on the too long side. It's much easier to make your images shorter on the timeline in bulk than it is trying to make everything a little bit longer. So if you think you're only going to need them for three and a bit seconds, for example, I would always make them about four seconds. So I've just got that extra little bit in case I need it because I can just make them shorter if needs be, which I'll show you how to do in a moment. Next up, we've got Scaling Options. Obviously, when you're dealing with multiple images, sometimes they're not always going to be the same aspect ratio or the same size. Fortunately, DaVinci Resolve has some scaling options which you can use to make life a little bit easier. So I've got a bin set up here called Landscape and I've got all of these images. Now if we double click, we can see they're all landscape, but some fill the frame. This one's perfect, whereas this one's got black bars on the sides. They're all slightly different sizes. But what I want to do is to have them so they all just zoom in to completely fill my frame. And this is easy to do. So what we need to do double click on literally any image within here so that it appears within your preview window like so. Then I'm going to use my mouse just to select all the other images. I want to change. So I've selected them all like so. Open up your Inspector top right hand corner. So I've got it over here. And if I scroll down, there's a RETIME and SCALING option. If you don't see all the options under there, just give RETIME and SCALING a click and they will appear. In this scaling option, the third one down, give that a click and you've got CROP, FIT, FILL and STRETCH. Now you can have a play, test them all out and see which one works, but generally the one you'll probably want to go for is FILL. So if I click FILL, it's just going to zoom this image in so that we don't have any black bars on the outside. It's literally just zooming it to fill the frame. And because we selected all of our images, every single one will have the same thing applied. So then if I grab all of these, drop them on my timeline. They're all going to be four seconds thanks to our default image length. And if we scroll through, every single one is going to be zoomed in to fit the frame perfectly. But that doesn't work for every situation. Sometimes you may want the images to be smaller in the frame and you purposely leave some space for a background image and that sort of thing. Now you can use pretty much the same technique to transform your images as well. So that's what we'll have a look at next. Now exactly the same thing. Pick any of your images, double click so it's in your preview window. Click your mouse, select all of your images like so. In the inspector, we're going to scroll up to the top and then we're just going to change our zoom. So I'm going to zoom out. We can change anything within here, rotation, pitch, yaw, all that sort of stuff. I just want to zoom out a little bit because I want this empty space because I'm going to use a background image for a background. And then we can just click, drag, drop them all along our timeline and every single one will be slightly zoomed out like so. So we're ready to go. Changing the length on the timeline. As mentioned at the beginning, sometimes you may have set a default length, drop funny timeline and then you've changed your mind. Now I always go slightly longer because it's much easier to make them shorter. So let me show you how to do that. So all of these images now on my timeline are four seconds in length but I want them to be a little bit shorter. So all I'm going to do, click, drag to select everything on my timeline like so to the highlighted in red. And then we're going to right click and we've got a change clip duration option or we can use the keyboard shortcut of control and D. And this change clip duration box will appear. We can change between time and frames. We can manually enter the duration within here or there are a couple of presets as well. So mine's currently four seconds. I'm just going to change it to three seconds. We'll hit change. And now all of my images on my timeline are three seconds in length instead. Obviously that's not perfect because now we've got these gaps but these are really easy to get rid of as well. So I'm just going to highlight everything once again. So we've got all of these images selected. Then we're going to click on edit at the very top and then come down and you've got delete gaps. If we click delete gaps, that'll just delete all of those gaps for the images that we selected. Simple. Next up we've got backgrounds and you've got loads of options with backgrounds. Let me start off by showing you some of the inbuilt ones and then I'll show you some of the other options as well. We're going to start off with solid color. So if I just wanted my background to be a solid color, whatever it may be, all I'm going to do is grab all of these images and I'm just going to drag them up one track so we've got space underneath. Then we're going to open up our effects library, top left hand corner. We're going to expand the toolbox. And then we're going to come down to generators and within here we've got a solid color. We'll drag the solid color onto our video track one, lengthen it out like so. Give it a click in the inspector video generator. We've got a color box. We just give that a click and we can change this color to be whatever we want it to be to make our background color whatever we want. Now, if you don't want just a solid color, there's another option within here called a four color gradient. Works in exactly the same way. You just drop it on, lengthen it out in the inspector, go to generator and you can change the colors and move it around to get it exactly as you want it. Now, the last built in option here, just delete this once again, still within generators, scroll down until you get to this paper icon. Give that a click, exactly the same thing, lengthen this out. And this gives you sort of a fake paper start effect, which I think works really well. Alternatively, of course, you could import a background. I've got a folder here set up called backgrounds. And I've just downloaded these from a website called Pexels. You can literally go to Pexels and download whatever you want for free and use them in your projects. So let's say I wanted this wooden background. We could just drag that onto our video track one, lengthen this out. It's a bit small, so we're going to open the inspector, zoom it in a little bit like so. And now we've got this wooden style background, easy peasy. Next up, we've got effects. There's loads of different effects which you can use to elevate your slideshow just to that next level. We've got things like drop shadows, blanking fills, colored borders, as well as things like Gaussian blur. They're really quick and easy to use. And again, you can just experiment, mix and match, apply the ones that you want to get your slideshow looking. Exactly as you want it. So a great one for this is the Gaussian blur. So our background here, it's got a nice wood effect, but it's a bit sharp. It's sort of distracting from the images. So still within our effects library, we're just going to go to open effects. Right at the top, we've got this one here called Gaussian blur, which is going to drop that onto our background. And it's just going to soften that background a little bit to make our images pop. We open up the inspector, we go to effects, and then we can just control the amount of blur by using the Gaussian blur sliders within there to get it looking exactly as we want it. Next up, we've got drop shadows. So again, still within the open effects, we're going to scroll down until we get to the resolve FX stylized area. There's one in here simply called drop shadow. We can just drop that on our image. And now we get this nice drop shadow effect. Same thing, give it a click. You've got all of the drop shadow options in there. If you need to copy your drop shadow from the one image to all of them, it's really simple. Give the one that you have the drop shadow applied a click. And then hit control and C on your keyboard. Select all of the others like so. And then hit Alt and V or Command and V if you're on a Mac. And this paste attributes box will appear. Then just make sure to tick this plugins box. Click on apply and it'll copy that drop shadow to all of your images really quickly and really easily. Next up, colored border. It's probably one of the most common effects that people want to use for slideshows. And it's just to put a white or a different colored border around the outside of your image. Now there is an effect built into the edit page but it doesn't really work as it should. Instead you need to hop into the fusion page. But don't worry, it's really simple and it's really easy so it's nothing too scary. Let me show you. So to add that color to the border, right click on any of your images. I'm just going to go to the first one here. And we're going to open in the fusion page. And fusion will open like so. Now you want to make sure that you've got this little timeline at the bottom where you can see all of your individual clips. If you don't see that, simply click on the word Clips up in the top left hand corner like so. Now open up the effects library. If it's not open already, this area over here. And then click on templates. And then all we're going to do, there's a little magnifying glass at the top here. We're going to give that a click. And we're just going to type in colored border. Or I can just type in C-O-L-O. And it'll find the colored border. We're just going to click, drag. And we're going to drop on this yellow line here until it goes yellow and blue. And that's just going to put a white border around that image like so. If we give the colored border a click in the inspector, we've got options in here to change the soft edge. We can change the width. We can change the radius, the color. Experiment with that to get this looking exactly as you want it. Then to copy this across to all of your other images, from the clips, click on the first one. So I'm going to ignore this background. We don't want it on there. And start with the elephant one here. Scroll right over to the last one. I'm going to hold shift on my keyboard and then give it a click so that they're all highlighted in red like so. Then we're going to go back to our first one. We're going to right click and we're going to apply composition. That'll ask us if we want to overwrite. We do. And that's going to copy our colored border to all of our individual images. So then when we go back to the edit page, we have our colored border on every single one of our photos like so. And now for a real quick message from this video sponsor, Surfshark VPN.

This is kind of an effect, kind of a background. It takes your image, blurs it out and sets it as the background for you. It's a simple effect to use but it looks really, really good. So I'm going to delete my wooden background because you don't actually need it for this one. Instead I'm going to give this image a click. Within the open effects once again, just above the drop shadow which we've just applied, there's a second option called blanking fill. So we're going to just drag that and drop it onto one of our images like so. Now as you can see, it's just made a nice little duplicate of our image and blurred it out for the background. But it does a few weird things, don't know why. So what you want to do in the inspector, go to effects, you've got all of your blanking fill options within here, expands source and by default it has a slight crop on it, which is kind of annoying. So what we want to do, drag all of that to the left to get rid of your crop. Now what you can see is it's using our border as the blanking fill border as well, which we don't want. So all I'm going to do, change this zoom mode from stretch to timeline to manual. And then you've got this expand and you can just choose how zoomed in you want this little background to be. So I'm just going to zoom in a little bit so you can't see my white edges and perfect. Now have a play with all of the options within here. You can blend the edges, you can change how much the background is blurred, do all sorts of fun stuff. I love a drop shadow. You don't use the drop shadow effect, instead you come down to drop shadow and then just increase the shadow strength until you get your little shadow appear. And then of course you can change the angle, change the distance, change the blur, do whatever you want with that from here. Now of course we need to copy that to all of our other images. So simply hit your first one, hit a control C once again, select all of your other images, hit alt and V, the paste attributes will appear. Again we just want the plugins, so we're going to hit apply and that's going to copy our blanking fill to all of our other images. Like so, simple and easy. Transitions. Next up you're going to want to select some transitions to transition between all of your different images. There's a few which I think work really well, so let me point those out and I can also show you how to set up a default and to apply the one transition to all of your images really quickly. So effects library once again, video transitions. Now the ones that I think work well, you've got a cross dissolve, which is just a real nice sort of slow dissolve between your images. You've got a dip to color, which will just go to a black or a white image and then onto the next one. If we scroll down, we've got one called push, which I'll show you how to use in a second. That's a really handy one. And if you scroll right down, there's some really interesting ones like paint on, is great. Let me pop that on there and it just does a nice little paint over effect like so. You've got one simply called noise dissolve, which will dissolve between the two like that. And then if you keep going down, right to the very bottom, there's one called burn away. And if we pop that on there, that just does a little burn away effect like that. If I want to apply a transition to multiple, I can just select them all like so. Let me grab my paint on. If I right click, I can add to selected edit points and clips. And I'll just put them transition between all of them. So we've really quickly created our slideshow with transitions as we need it. So I'm going to go with a real simple dip to color transition. So what I'm going to do, we could drag this or pop this on here like so. And then it's just going to go to black. If we give it a click, in the inspector, we've got all of the options in here, which we can change. I always recommend changing the ease to ease in and out. It just gives it a more acceleration. Looks a little bit nicer. If I change the color, let's go with a white background rather than black. Click on okay. We just get a nice little fade to white like so. Now, if I want to save this as a preset, if I right click the transition on the timeline, I can create a transition preset. Give it a name. I'm just going to go with white and then click on okay. Now, if I scroll down within the video transitions until we get to the user area, you can now see I've got a white transition. So if I just highlight all of my other edit points like so, we can right click on white, add to selected edit points and clips. It'll add that white transition to all of my other edit points. So now we've got this animated slideshow with all of our transitions in place like so. Now, this is a really cool example of how to use the push transition. Now, you do need to set your timeline up differently for this one. So it's not great if you've got a huge slideshow, but if you've got just a few images, it does work well. Rather than having all of my images next to each other on a single track, I've simply stacked them on top of each other and made them get slightly shorter in duration as you can see here. And to make them really stand out, you'll notice that I've set the rotation angle of each one slightly differently so they don't actually align perfectly once they're on top of each other. Now, we're going to go to my video transitions, scroll down until it gets to the motion area, and then we've got this push transition, and we're going to drop this onto the first one like so. We can maybe lengthen it out, make it a little bit longer, give it a click, open the inspector, and then we've got the controls within here. Once again, I'm going to set my ease to in and out, maybe set a little bit of motion blur for this one. And then if I simply go back and hit play, this image is just going to fly in from the left-hand side like so. We can change the direction that it's coming in by changing this preset. We've got left, right, up, and down. I'll leave it as left for now. Now, I need to duplicate this transition onto my next image. So I'm going to give it a click so it's highlighted in red, hold down the Alt key, drag to the next edit point, and then release. Give it a click, make any changes if you want. So let's say I want this one to push in from the right. Now, if we go back and hit play, this one flies in from the left, the next one comes in from the right, and they sort of stack on top of each other. We'll duplicate this again using the Alt key. Give it a click. We'll make this one a push up. And the last one, a push down. And now we've got this really nice little animation they slide in. Start stacking on top of each other, almost like an old-school Polaroid effect. And job done. Zooms. Another popular effect is to add a bit of a zoom to your images, whether that be a zoom in or a zoom out, just to give it an extra little something. Now, zooms are done using dynamic zooms. They're a bit difficult to copy and paste for some reason. So there's a little work around which I like to use using adjustment clips. So still within our effects library, but this time we're going to go to the effects area. You've got an adjustment clip. We're just going to drag this and put it on our timeline above our images like so. Now, if you wanted a zoom across your entire slideshow, you could make this adjustment clip the entire length, or you could have over a couple of images, however you want this to work. I'm going to put this over just one image like so, and then we can duplicate it as we need to. If we give the adjustment clip a click in the inspector, scroll down until you see dynamic zoom, click the little toggle to turn that on, and now we've just got this zoom effect like so. Underneath your preview window, there's a little drop down box, change that to be dynamic zoom, and then the green box represents the starting point, the red box represents the end point. So if you want much more of a zoom, you make the green one smaller. If you want just a subtle zoom, which is what I want, we're going to make the green one much closer to the red one like so. And then if we go back and hit play, you can see we've just got this real subtle little movement. If you want to swap them, so it's an in rather than an out, in the inspector, simply hit the word swap. It'll swap the green and red boxes around, and now we've got a slightly different zoom like so. Once you're done, just click that little icon to toggle the display off, and now we've got our zoom like so. Now I need to duplicate this for each of my images, so all I'm going to do, hold alt on my keyboard, give my adjustment clip a click, keeping them both how, just drag to create a duplicate, and we can just keep doing this by holding down alt to create as many duplicates as we like. And now I've got nice slow zooms for every single one of our images in our slideshow. Aging effects, if it's a more retro style slideshow that you're after, there are a few effects within all versions of the venture resolve, including the free version, which you can apply to give it a much more retro aesthetic. So we've got this slideshow setup. I've done nothing to this other than simply setting the scaling so that everything fits the frame. So now we're just going to give it a retro look. In the effects library, go to effects, and then grab an adjustment clip and put it above your images like so, and then lengthen it out so it covers all of them like this. Then we can apply our retro effects to this adjustment clip. And there's a few that you can apply, depending on exactly what look you're going for. So the first thing I like to do, go to the open effects, and then from within here, scroll right down until you get to the transform area, and there's a transform effect. Drop that onto your adjustment clip like so. Give the adjustment clip a click. In the inspector, go to effects, and then you've got your transform controls within here. Scroll down to image adjustment, click crop, and then just crop all sides. So I'm just going to crop the left, right, top, and bottom by 0.1. So just literally going to put 0.1 in each of these. That's going to put this square sort of frame around it, and then we're going to just increase the edge softness, and then also increase the rounding. And now we've got this almost projector style effect, which just simply makes it look a little bit more old school. Now, obviously, it's still got too much pop. It doesn't really look that retro, so now we need to add an additional effect. Still within the open effects, just scroll up a little bit, and there's one here called film damage. This is available in the free version as well. Drop that on your adjustment clip, and this is just going to blur it, age it, give it a slightly more sepia look, and put some scratches and dirt on there as well. Still within the inspector, scroll down. You've got film damage, give that a click, and you've got all of these controls within here, so you can change the amount of blur, the temp shift, the tint shift, the focal factor, change the color and the density of the dirt, do all that sort of stuff to get it looking however you want it. If that's still not enough, one last thing you can apply, back down into this transform effects area. You've got camera shake. Drop that onto your adjustment clip as well. Hit play. It's going to be a bit much, so it's moving around all over the place, but if we go still within the inspector camera shake, we're going to put the motion scale and the speed scale right down. So we've just got a little tiny bit of wobble, which just gives it a slightly more retro sort of projector style effect. Shoot into your video transitions and grab a slide, which works well for this one. Pop it on there, give it a click. Same thing again, maybe a little bit of motion blur, and then ease in and out. Copy this across, maybe add some sound effects, and then you've got this nice projector style looking slideshow. Simple. And last but not least, we've got compound clips. If you've finished your slideshow, but you don't want it to be full screen, maybe you want it to be in a corner like I've got it here, you can do that really easily using a compound clip. So I've got my slideshow, it's all done, it's all ready to go. All I'm going to do is highlight everything within the slideshow, background, any adjustment clips, everything we need. We're going to right click, and we're going to select new compound clip. Give it a name, so I'm going to call this slideshow and click create. And now our slideshow is one individual thing, which we can just move around and put wherever we want on our timeline. Let me just grab a different background, just so we've got something to look at. Now, if I give my slideshow a click, I can just zoom this out, rotate it, put it wherever I want. And if I hit play, our slideshow is still going to work in exactly the same way, but now we can use it as a picture in picture and have it wherever we want it. If we want to get into this to make any amendments, we can simply right click the slideshow, open in timeline, and then we're back in here with all of our adjustment clips and all of our individual images. So then get back to our main timeline, I've got timeline one down here on the left. That may be different, it'll be better if you've called your timeline, just double click that, and then you're back on here. If you want to actually revert your compound clip back to its original form, right click on the timeline, you want decompose in place using clips only, and it'll just revert it back to where it was. With all those tips and tricks, you should be good to make pretty much any slideshow you like. Hopefully you enjoyed this video, if you did, let me know down in the comment section below. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next time.
