What up, folks? It's Alex here and welcome to 5.00 Friday. Now, in last week's video, if you missed it, I showed you how to customize a bunch of these standard inbuilt transitions within DaVinci Resolve to create some new, cool, interesting little effects. Now, of course, you can apply those to video clips, but did you know you can also apply those transitions to titles or text as well? Now, using those transitions on titles or text just makes you a really nice, easy way to animate titles and to make that text just pop and look that little bit nicer. So in this video, I'm going to show you exactly how to do that. So let's open DaVinci Resolve and take a look, shall we? So here we are in DaVinci Resolve, and I've got a real simple clip setup of this sort of drone shot through the woods. And then I've got just a bug, standard text bug here with a title into the wild that just appears abruptly. It's just a cut and it appears and then it goes away at the end like so. So we're just going to open up the effects library. We're going to come down to the toolbox. We're going to go to the video transitions and then we can start having a play with some of these. So the dissolve ones, the blurs, they're not that useful, honestly, because you can basically do the same thing just using these handles like so to blur them in. So if we scroll down, the best one to really start with is the push. It's under the motion category. So we're going to grab push and we're just going to drag that and apply that to our text like you'd apply a transition to anything else. And we can drag that make it a little bit longer, a little bit shorter, whichever we want to do. And then if we just hit play, the text will push in from the left hand side like so. Now that doesn't look too bad, but we can make that look a little bit better. So what we can do, give it a click, head up to the top right hand corner and open the inspector. And then you should see all of these transition options in here. So under push, you've got preset and you can push left, right, up or down. So let's say we want this text to appear from the bottom moving upwards. If we change that to push up, and then if we hit play, the text will just move up from the bottom into place. And then if we come down to the ease, you can change the easing. So at the moment, it's just linear, which means there's no acceleration or deceleration, the text is just moving at a constant pace. But if we change the ease, now usually for transitions, I always tell you to use in and out. But for text, it's slightly different. If you're transitioning the text in like I'm doing here, it's the beginning of the clip, change the ease to out. I know that sounds like the wrong way around, but trust me, or what that means is the text will move fast at the beginning and then slow down as it starts to fit into place like so. And it looks really smooth, really natural and really nice. Now let's say we want the text to disappear at the end in a similar fashion. Quick trick for you here, give the transition a click. So it's highlighted in red, holding down the Alt key on your keyboard, drag the transition to the end and you'll see duplicate and then let go. And there you go. And you've duplicated that transition. Now at the moment, it's going to go up and the easing is still set to out. So we're going to give it a click, change the ease to in this time. And what that will mean is it will start off slowly and then accelerate as it goes. And we can change the direction if we want to. So it's currently pushing up. Let's say we want it to push down. So then we've got the text coming up from the bottom. And at the end, it goes back down to the bottom. And that's it. Easy peasy. You've got this animated text and it's way easier than keyframing it. Now let's just remove these. Of course, you can play with any of these. Just have a mess around, see which ones work for you. The wipes can create an interesting effect. So if I just put a band wipe on here and we'll hit play, it will just wipe across like so. Again, we're going to change the easing to be out. This is at the beginning. And it will look something like this. So it will start off fast and then slow down as it goes into place. And again, there's lots of different presets here, horizontal, vertical. Have a play with them. See how you get on. Now it's also worth mentioning that if you've downloaded any of my transitions in the past, you can use all of those as well. So the ones that work particularly well on my glitch transitions. Now if you haven't downloaded my glitch transitions, why not? They're free. Check the link in the description. There's a link to go download those now. So I'm just going to grab Mr. Alex Tech Glitch Number 4. We'll put that on there. And now we've got this really spooky looking glitchy text animation to just bring that text into place. Looks really cool. Don't need to make any changes to it. I can do if I want to because there's loads of options in here or we can just leave it be and job done. And that's it. I hope you enjoyed this video.
