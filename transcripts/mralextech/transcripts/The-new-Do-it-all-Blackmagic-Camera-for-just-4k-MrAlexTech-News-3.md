What up folks, it's Alex here, Mr. Alex Tech, and welcome to the news. This week it's been a pretty big one for new hardware releases. Blackmagic have released a couple of new things and there's been another hardware release elsewhere as well. So that's what we're going to talk about in this video today. And the first thing we're going to talk about are these brand new 12G micro converters from Blackmagic themselves. We've got an SDI to HDMI converter, a HDMI to SDI converter, and then a bidirectional SDI slash HDMI converter. Now, as you've probably guessed by the name, these are little micro converters that are used to convert an SDI format or signal to a HDMI signal so that you can connect consumer level devices, which have got HDMI ports on them, to professional level devices, which use SDI instead. Now, if you're not already aware, SDI is a co-actual video output used for the transmission of unencrypted and uncompressed digital video signals. Now, the reason it's used in professional environments is because it has an extended range and generally better reliability. You don't often see SDI ports on consumer level devices that save for more professional level stuff instead. So in a nutshell, these converters are there. So if you're running a high-grade professional camera with an SDI out, you can run a long-ass cable, 200 meters, to a desk somewhere, use the SDI to HDMI converter, and then you can just plug it into a standard monitor that obviously only has a HDMI input, rather than an SDI input. And that obviously works both ways, depending on whether you want HDMI to SDI or SDI to HDMI. Now, these micro converters are 12G, which basically means they have a transmission rate of 12 gigabytes per second. Well, that basically means that they're good for the 3G format, which is standard definition and high definition, but then they're also got enough bandwidth that they can cover ultra HD up to 4K 60 frames per second. Now, the models are available immediately, apparently from all worldwide black magic resellers at a cost of $109 US. Don't know how much interest that is to a lot of you guys, but they're new, so I figured it was worth letting you know. Now, continuing talking about black magic, they've also released a new camera. The camera is the Blackmagic Ursa Broadcast G2. It's a next-generation broadcast camera with a 6K super 35 millimeter digital sensor. It looks to be either very similar or at least the same sensor as you'd get from the Blackmagic Pocket 6K. Now, on the face of it, this doesn't seem that interesting for us normal sort of regular non-professional users, but it's slightly more interesting than you'd think it is. It can record in H.264, 265, ProRes 422, 422 HQ, and of course, Blackmagic RAW. There's in-built ND filters. You've got a clear one, so no ND. Then you've got two stops, four stops, and six stops. It runs the standard Blackmagic operating system, so if you've used any of the pocket cameras or any of the video assists, you know what you're getting in there, it's a really nice, easy to use interface. It takes V-Lock or gold mount batteries. There's a V-Lock adapter included in the package, and it has dual CFAST two card slots, dual SD UHS two card slots, so standard SD cards, and it also has a USB Type-C port so that you can run it off to an external SSD. That's really cool, by the way, just to let you know. Doesn't seem like a big thing, but I was doing that for a long time using my Blackmagic video assist, and running off to an SSD, which you can then just plug into your computer and edit straight from there. It's really, really awesome, and I'm definitely going to look at doing that, continuing on this channel, because it just makes life way easier. Now, it comes with a B4 broadcast lens mount by default, and I know absolutely nothing about that, because I've never used any broadcast sort of lenses. I've never worked in that environment, so I don't really know anything about that. Now, all of that doesn't sound that interesting, because it's all broadcast stuff. It sounds like a cool camera, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't sound like it's something that I would have any real need or desire to use, but then it does get a little bit more interesting. See, that B4 broadcast lens mount is detachable, so you can take that lens mount off, and in the box include an EF lens mount. So EF is your standard Canon lens mount, again the same lens mount which you see on the Blackmagic Pocket 6K. You can also then go out and buy an additional lens mount, which is a PL lens mount, which is for things like Arri, Cinema, Lenses, QuiteNiche, quite special sort of stuff. But that EF mount is really interesting. As I mentioned, it's included in the box, so you can just swap out the B4 for the EF mount. When you swap out to the EF mount, you still do get access to those internal ND filters, by the way, which means you can grab this camera, hop on Amazon, grab yourself a Nifty 50 Canon 50mm for like 80 quid or whatever they cost these days, and you're good to go, which is really quite cool. Now on top of that, it also has live streaming built in, so you can actually live stream directly from this to YouTube. Now in the video with Grant Petty, the CEO of Blackmagic, he does mention that they are working on some additional live streaming features, which they're looking to bring out as a free update later in the year or early next year, sometime at some point in the future, so they're going to expand the live streaming capabilities of this camera. So all in all, it's not just a broadcast camera, which is why it's kind of interesting. It says it's a broadcast camera, but it does far more than that. It's a professional broadcast camera, but it's also a live streaming camera, and on top of that, you could really use it, slap on some EF lenses, take it out with you, and it becomes a shoulder mounted cinema camera, which is really cool. So how much does all of that cost? Six grand, maybe? 10 grand for this professional broadcast live streaming cinema camera? Actually, no, it's listed at $3,995, which in the UK, checking on the scan.co.uk website, one of my favorite websites to have a look at this sort of thing, it comes in at 3,575 quid, which is quite reasonable, really, don't get me wrong, I know it's not cheap, but for what it is, Blackmagic coming in again with something that's really, really quite well priced. Now if you do want to know more about it, or you want to see it in action, the man himself, Grant Petty, CEO of Blackmagic, he's released a video over on the Blackmagic YouTube channel, so you can go have a look at it, he talks you through some of the additional stuff, so go check that out, I've linked that down in the description below, along with the original Blackmagic press release. So we're going to move on to the third and final bit of tech news this week, and it's from DJI once again, they're creeping into the news because they've done a new release as well. It's not a drone, what is it then? Camera, Osmo, new Osmo? No, a microphone, they've released a microphone. Yes, the DJI microphone is available for pre-order. It's not actually out just yet, but they've announced it. People are starting to get review units, so you can have a little look on YouTube for some reviews if you want to have a little look. And it's a microphone, very similar to the Rode style wireless Go sort of format, and it looks quite interesting. It's the default package, includes two wireless transmitters, each with its own built-in microphone, and then a 3.5 millimeter port, so you can attach a lav mic like I'm wearing right now. And then of course you get the receiver, which attaches to the 3.5 millimeter jack on your camera or your phone or whatever you've got. Now it looks nice and small and convenient, as all of these style of microphones do. They're climbing a huge 250 meters of range, which I'm guessing is lying of sight in like the best environment ever. You won't get that in real world, but as long as you get a solid connection of up to like 15, 20 meters, that'll keep most people happy, I would guess. Now, each of the transmitters has their own battery and the receiver as you'd expect, but it also comes with this nifty little carry case. Now that case has a battery inside, so you charge up the case, and then whenever the two mics and the receiver are in the box, they're actually charging. So you can charge them up a couple of times using the internal battery on the case itself. Now, that's not a new idea. DJI I think have been copying someone's homework, and I'm guessing they've been copying these. This is the Holleyland Lark 150. This is the mic I'm actually using at the minute, and if I open this up, you can see we've got space for the receiver, which I'm currently using, the transmitter, which is currently in my pocket, and then I've got my other little transmitter here. I charge the box, I plug them in, everything syncs up, charges, and I'm good to go. Now this is awesome, by the way. This is really, really cool. I really like the roads. I actually bought these, because I lost these, and then I found them again, which is kind of annoying, so I think I'm gonna give these away at some point. But this box, while it's a little bit chunky, makes things harder to carry around, it's so useful to keep everything together in one place, charge the box, and you know you're good for a whole weekend's worth of use. They're really, really cool, really, really like that. So DJI have obviously taken some inspiration from that, but that's not new in the tech world. People are doing that. Tech companies are copying each other all the time, so there you go. I think it's a good thing to implement, because I actually think it's a really cool idea, and I would bet money that road released something very, very similar in the foreseeable future. Now one thing which DJI have done to really make these stand out on the specs, they look very similar to the Hollylands, but what they have done is included eight gigabytes of internal storage on each of the mics, each of the transmitters. So even if you get cut out, your signals lost, all of your audio is still recorded internally, so you can just plug the actual transmitter into your computer, retrieve the WAV file from there, and you're good to go, which I think is a really neat little solution. So overall, these look quite cool. They're available to pre-order now at a price of $329 or 290 of your fine British pounds. And that's it for the news this week. Lots of tech, lots of new stuff. Let me know what you think down in the comment section below. Thanks for watching. Oh, excuse me. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. Bye.
