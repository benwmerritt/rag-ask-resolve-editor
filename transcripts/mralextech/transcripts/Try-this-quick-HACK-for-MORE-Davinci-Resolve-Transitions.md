I'm calling these stacked transitions and I sort of discovered this technique when it's creating my matrix video the other day. You see in that video there is this transition. Now this transition is actually made up of several standard DaVinci Resolve transitions stacked or layered on top of each other to create a unique looking transition. Now it is a workaround, it's a bit of a hack. If you want to create these transitions properly you should do so with infusion but in a pinch this can be a really cool way of quickly creating some unique effects and some unique transitions. Now I'm just going to show you a quick few examples but if you discover some that work really well comment below let us all know the things that you think look really cool so we can all try them out for ourselves. Now you can do this in the free Audish Studio versions of DaVinci Resolve so let's open it up and I'll show you how. So here we are in Resolve I've got my footage on my timeline now all we're going to do open up the effects library come down to video transitions and then you can just select any of the video transitions from here. You can use the default ones you can use the fusion ones you can even use the user ones. Now the example that I've used I'm just going to show you this I'm going to grab this one here called circles and I'm just going to drop it on my footage like I would any other transition and we've got this cool looking circles transition which looks all right on its own but we want to add something else to it to really make it stand out. So what you want to do grab your playhead and put it right on this edit point so right in the middle here like so using your mouse just highlight the two clips under the transition and then right click and then create a new compound clip. Now compound clips all they do is compact whatever you've selected into one little package so it acts like one clip everything's still there you can get it back you can edit it if you need to but it just contains everything so it's a little bit easier to deal with. Now it's asking us for a name what I like to do is to call the compound clip the same name as the transition that we've used so I'm just going to call this one circles and then hit create. Now before we do anything else before I move my playhead I'm just going to do a control and B on my keyboard to do a cut in the exact same position or location that the edit point was on the previous. Now what we can do with this cut here on our compound clip we can jump into the effects library and we can just grab any other transition so this time I'm going to grab this one which is a drop warp and we're going to drop that one on there and now if we take a look I'm just going to move my playhead in the middle we haven't just got the circles we've also got this warp effect so we've still got the circles doing that thing but we've got the warp effect as well so if I hit play we've got this transition which just looks really cool. Now we can keep going if we want to so what we're going to do playhead in the middle highlight them all right click compound clip I'm going to call this one warp and then hit create we're going to do a quick cut right in the same position and we'll grab a third transition so I'm just going to go with the camera shake because I know it adds a cool little RGB effect we're going to drop that right on the same position and now straight away we can see we've got our warp we've got our circles and now we've also got this camera shake adding the RGB effect so if we hit play on this one we've got this transition which is just combining all of the different elements now what's important to note at this point open up your media pool and you'll be able to see the compound clips within there so we've got one called circles and we've got one called warp now this is why it's not a great permanent solution because it can really easily clog up your media pool which is why I recommend if you want to create these permanently do something confusion if there are any that you want me to create for you or help you out with let me know down in the comment section below now what we can do in the media pool let's go to this circles one let's say I wanted to amend this transition on the circles compound clip just right click and then you can open in timeline and that will open down here that's compound clip so we're basically inside the compound clip if we click on the transition we can see it's the circles and then I can do what I like I can lengthen it I can shorten it I can just do what I would usually do to a transition I can open up the inspector I can change the color so let's just get rid of the red and the blue I'll have a green one we can just amend all the options within there then all we need to do is go to our timeline to find our original timeline within the media pool mine here is just called timeline one I'm just going to double click that's going to take us to our original timeline and if we just put my play head over the middle you can see that we now have the green circle so you can always go back and amend them if you need to do let us know if you find any cool combinations down in the comment section below thanks for watching take it easy I'll see you next time
