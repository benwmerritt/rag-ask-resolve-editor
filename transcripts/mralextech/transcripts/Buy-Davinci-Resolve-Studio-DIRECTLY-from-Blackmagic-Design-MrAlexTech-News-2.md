Yeah, you really can buy DaVinci Resolve Studio directly from Blackmagic for the first time ever Providing you live in the correct country. What up folks? It's your Monday night news with your host me, Mr. Alex Tech. And the first bit of news DJI have released not one But two brand new drones this week. We've got the DJI Mavic 3 and the DJI Mavic 3 Cine. It's rather used to be called Mavic Pro, but now that it's called Mavic So they've dropped that. Anyway, now the Mavic 3 and the Mavic 3 Cine are very very similar with a few additional Things on the Mavic 3 Cine. So let's just cover the main new features of these two drones The first thing is the camera system. Both have two cameras. The first primary camera is a 24 millimeter full frame equivalent house of blood lens and that's on a 20 megapixel 4 3rd CMOS sensor that's capable of up to 50 frames per second at 5.1 K and 120 frames per second at 4 K which is very very impressive indeed Then the second camera is a slightly odd one. That's a 162 millimeter full frame equivalent televoto lens That's on a one half inch CMOS sensor, but that can only do up to 30 frames per second at 4 K Now at the moment, there's no other real frame rate options on that secondary camera. It's 30 frames per second at 4 K There's no 25 24 frames anything like that which is a bit weird But it sounds like that's going to be included in a future update coming somewhere along the lines Now both of those lenses can shoot with DJI's D Cine like color profile And they're saying you can get a massive 12 stops of dynamic range from these cameras Which is very impressive indeed and it doesn't just stop there with the camera systems You've also got things like improved tracking more sensors There's eight sensors in total and bigger batteries giving up to 46 minutes of flight time, which is crazy I remember when these drones were struggling to get 15 18 20 minutes of flight time now It's up to 46 which is crazy now the DJI Mavic 3 Cine gets all of that fun stuff But then it also gets a 1 terabyte in built hard drive So you don't need to mess around with those stupid little micro SD cards anymore You can record it all internally and it also gets the ability to record in Apple ProRes 422 HQ format which is standard Mavic 3 doesn't now that's Apple ProRes 422 HQ So that is editable in DaVinci Resolve on both the Mac and Windows versions It's only the ProRes RAW I think it is which isn't available to edit in DaVinci Resolve just yet now of course all that new tech doesn't come cheap The standard Mavic 3 is coming in at 2199 of your US dollars the Flymore combo which includes the drone plus a couple of additional batteries and additional charger carry bag ND filters that sort of thing that comes in at $2999 and if you want to go all in and get the Cine premium combo Which is the improved drone all the other stuff from the Flymore combo as well as the DJI Pro remote Which has got a screen on it so you don't need to mess around with your phone. That's a whopping $4999 bucks so not cheap So there you go that all looks and sounds super duper cool And I won't be buying one anytime soon because they're very expensive and I wouldn't make the most of it But if you are thinking about buying it, let me know down in the comment section below now The next bit of news for this week you can buy DaVinci Resolve studio directly from Blackmagic Providing you live in a specific country Now this is big news because buying DaVinci Resolve studio has always been a bit of a weird process historically You could never buy it directly from Blackmagic themselves You had to go through a reseller and there was always two options You could either buy a dongle USB dongle have to plug it into Run Studio or you can get an activation key Oh an activation key so you can get it emailed so you can access straight away No, they'd put it in the post for some reason so you'd still have to wait x amount of time for that activation key To be delivered and then all you do is open it up look at the number enter it and then bin it well She'd probably back it up, but so it was all a little bit strange But now you can buy it directly from Blackmagic. I just want to let you know This hasn't been revealed anywhere. I found this by mistake. I just messing around on the DaVinci Resolve website I saw it and thought oh, that's news So I don't know when they announced this. I don't know how long it's been a thing But it is a thing you just need to hop onto the DaVinci Resolve website needs to make sure you're on the US version So if you're from the UK or anyone else in Europe, it will default to a different version click on the flag change that to the US And job done scroll down to the studio software area and under DaVinci Resolve studio rather than saying find resellers Which is what it says on the UK website You'll see that it says buy now and then you can give that a click and you can buy DaVinci Resolve studio directly from Blackmagic themselves There's an important note on there that says please be aware that when you place an order for DaVinci Resolve studio Your activation key will be emailed to you immediately and your serial number will be emailed to you with a tax invoice during business hours But as mentioned, it's not yet available for us in the UK or really anyone else in Europe by the looks of things It's only for those in a specific list of countries, which is a little bit strange What would happen if you were from the UK and you bought it from the US website? I don't know. I don't recommend you try unless you're willing to bet the 290 bucks that it costs and if you do do that, let me know Let me know how he goes and what happens I do not recommend you do that though It's clearly been set up like this for a specific reason and you may end up losing out if you do try it So be warned, but if you do try let me know, but I think this is a massive win I think it's a much much better way of buying DaVinci Resolve studio. It's quicker. It's easier It's more efficient and it's more environmentally friendly They're not packaging things up kind of pointlessly sending it out Don't know that sort of stuff. So this is a big big win and a much better process I think going forward. So hooray. Well done black magic now the next bit of news I stumbled across on my travels the sky UK television show Brassick Which is back for a third season was created with the help of DaVinci Resolve studio, which is kind of cool No, I honestly hadn't heard of it either, but I don't really watch sky So maybe that'd be why but after reading this think about it gonna check it out just out of interest now It was actually color graded by a post production house by the name of core post who are based in Manchester UK and they did grade the color graded the entire season using DaVinci Resolve studio Which is kind of cool. Now. What's more interesting is when you dive into some of these articles, which they've released It's kind of nice being able to understand the lingo and have a general idea of what they're talking about And here's a really good example of that There's a chap over there called Matt Brown who works for core post and he talks about the fact that they released this series in HDR High dynamic range and SDR the standard dynamic range and in this article he talked about the process We created adjustment layers for the HDR and SDR versions so that anyone working on the project could quickly move between versions by Disabling features and turning off our book mapping So basically on the timeline They had an adjustment clip above everything and they could just toggle them on and off whether they wanted to see or grade the HDR version or the SDR version which sounds like a really logical thing to do now It wasn't just the color grade that was done in DaVinci Resolve There was another company who are also based in Manchester called digital imaging effects And they actually did all of the VFX compositing in Fusion as well now it's a comedy series So you probably wouldn't think there was that much VFX going on but VFX supervisor Tanvier Hanif said that there was something like 400 VFX shots in the eight episode series which for a comedy drama is pretty staggering Now doing all of the grading on the color page and then all of the VFX compositing within Fusion Allowed the two companies to work together really really well because they're all working on one timeline They use the collaboration features within DaVinci Resolve so that they could just make everything work Seamlessly between the two different sites Tanvier Hanif went on to say we're now heading into work on the fourth season of Brassick And the workflow has gone from strength to strength a lot of the success can be attributed to DaVinci Resolve and our ability to work together In one solution so that's cool It's just nice to hear that DaVinci Resolve being put to good use in that sort of professional environment And the fact that we get to read a little bit of an insight to see how it's working for these companies Which is really cool now I personally have never really worked with the collaboration features in DaVinci Resolve So I don't know a huge amount about them But if you are interested there's a company called Jigsaw 24 and they're running a collaborative workflows in DaVinci Resolve webinar on November the 11th at 3 p.m. GMT time I've linked that down in the description below So if you're interested you can go register for that or have a look or ask any question do whatever you want It's there if you fancy taking a look and that's it That's the news for this week if you enjoyed this let me know if not or so let me know that as well Take it easy. I'll see you next time Bye
