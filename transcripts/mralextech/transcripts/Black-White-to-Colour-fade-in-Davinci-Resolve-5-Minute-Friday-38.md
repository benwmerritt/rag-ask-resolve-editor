What up folks, it's Alex here. Now the other week I showed you how to make a real cool quick glitch transition effect. If you missed it, check it out up here. Now what goes really well with that sort of effect is a simple fade from black and white into color. Put them together and you get something that looks a little bit like this. So that's what I'm going to show you how to do today. Using keyframes, do a quick fade from black and white footage into color. Nice and easy. Let's burn and resolve and I'll show you how. So here we are in DaVinci Resolve and I've got on my timeline set up ready to go. And it's this clip here that I want to fade from black and white into color. Now you can do this directly on the clip but I generally recommend using an adjustment clip. It just makes life a little bit easier for you. So first up, open up your effects library, shoot down here where you've got toolbox, go to effects, adjustment clip and then drag it onto your timeline directly above the clip that you're trying to amend. And we're just going to make that the same length like so. And that's it. We can now head into the color tab. Now from here, make sure that you select that adjustment clip. If you don't see these clips in the middle of your screen like I do here, you just need to click on this clips icon in the top right hand corner to make sure you see those. Also while we're here, make sure that you click on this little diamond down in the bottom right hand corner to make sure that you can see the key frame. Now the next thing you need to do is use your little playhead within the preview here and select the point where you want the clip to start transitioning from black and white to color. So I'm going to go for about a third of the way in here. Then in this key frames panel, we just need to click on this little diamond here next to correct at one to add a key frame. So we've added the key frame. Now we can make a change so we can turn this footage black and white. Now in this little menu on the left, make sure you've got the color wheel selected by clicking on this icon here. And you'll see the color wheels here. And then just make sure that you're on one of two down in the bottom left hand corner. Now to make it black and white, all we're going to do is either enter zero or just click and drag in the saturation here. So drag our saturation down, remove all the color and make the footage black and white. You can make any other changes here if you want to as well. So maybe you want to boost the contrast, maybe bring up the gain, whatever you want to do. Now you'll notice in the key frames it's added a key frame for us. Now what we need to do, grab your playhead again and move to the point where you want the transition to a finished and your clip to be fully color. So I'm going to go about halfway, about there. Now we don't need to add another key frame because it'll do it automatically for us. So what we now need to do is to restore this footage at this point back to color. So we can do so by just typing in 50 in the saturation or just double click on the word SAT to bring that saturation back. Now if we just go back here and we hit play, you can see the clip is in black and white at the beginning and then it'll begin transitioning into color as all the saturation comes back in. Now in the key frames, you'll notice we've now got two. So we've got one here. This is our first one. So this is the point where we start transitioning from black and white to color and this is the color one. Everything before this one here will be black and white and everything after this one will be color and you can amend them if you want to. So if your transition is too short, you can just drag these key frames to lengthen it. You can do what you need to do and that's it folks. Easy as that. I hope you enjoyed the video.
