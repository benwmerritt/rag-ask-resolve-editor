I managed to get out of bed and actually get myself to work just sat in the car. This is going to be a slightly different video today. It's not something I usually do but I'm doing a day in the life vlog. I've never done one of these before because a day in my life is really dull. There is nothing exciting to report generally speaking but today is a little bit different. But why? I hear you ask. Why today? Why is there any difference? Well today is the day that I hit 1000 subscribers on YouTube. There's 1000 of you lovely people subscribed to my channel as of today and that is amazing. So I wanted to do a quick video to say thank you. Sincere thank you for subscribing, for supporting, for liking, for commenting, for sharing, for everything else. Really really appreciate the support of all you guys. I'm going to continue doing it all throughout 2019. Hopefully I'll keep up the five minute Friday. I'll keep working on some DaVinci Resolve stuff and I also want to do some other stuff. I won't ever abandon the DaVinci Resolve stuff because that's why most of you are here but I do also want to do some more general photography stuff and maybe some with shadow and just general tech and more reviews and all that sort of thing. So yeah this was just a real quick video to say thank you. I hope you enjoy it. I don't really do vlogs because I'm not that excited but here's one. Let's see how it goes. Now I'm going to go back into the office and eat my lunch. Ten virtual Animal Travels points if you can name the song and the artist. Yeah. Now for those that don't know 1000 subscribers and 4000 hours of watch time in the past 365 days means you can monetize your YouTube channel. So I've now hit the threshold to monetize. Apparently I could make money off you all. But I don't plan to. The whole point of the five minute Friday really is to get these nice quick, I know a ramble sometimes, but generally nice quick bite size clips for you guys to get on and have a look and hopefully learn something. I'm still a very small YouTube channel. My channel is tiny really. So I don't think I'd earn enough for it to be worth a while. Now I'm not going to lie. If in 12 months time this channel has continued to grow and I have a look and it says oh you could be earning 200 quid a month of this, I'll probably do it because I've got a wedding to pay for at some point. I've got mortgages, I've got bills, any extra money like that would be really, really handy. But at the meantime, I feel the inconvenience to your wall would massively outweigh any financial gain to myself. So I don't plan on doing it. But if you've got any feedback, any thoughts, pop them in the comment below. I think it'd be a really good, important discussion to have. Now there are other ways I can try and make money from my YouTube. I can do Amazon affiliate and that sort of thing. I just don't make the most of it at the minute. So this year I may try and make more use of that sort of thing. But we'll see. I don't actually know if you're going to be able to see me under this crappy light, but we're home. It's Friday, we've got the weekend, yippee, happy days. Time to go in, tell loads of the misses, get some food, walk the dogs and then we're off out for a drink I think later. So happy days. Don't know if you're better able to see. But every time I come back from work, every day, my little man sits and watches. Hey, really, hey buddy. I'm going to come tell you. I'm going to come tell you. Hello. Sorry, I missed you. I love a parcel, mate. Let's see what's exciting things the Amazon man has brought me today. I actually already know, but hey, Rolls, you want me to open it? Yes. Well, it all planned out, but then you ruined it, didn't you? We have a microphone pop filter. There's only a cheap one, but after my last video with this bad boy here, the new microphone, you all recommended that I grabbed a pop filter, so here it is. How do we think this goes? I'm going to put that on there. There we go. Dogs just rub that box. Ready? Thank you very much. All right, now the mic's all set up. Pop filter is in the way. This is recording with the mic at the minute. It's on this one, not that one. So you can see how it all sounds. It's by Innogear, by the way, who wants to pick a cheap one up. I'll pop a link in the description. Oh, no, I'll pop an affiliate. Yeah, I've got an affiliate link in the description below. So if you fancy picking one up, I might get 2p out of it. Yeah, there you go. Hang on a minute. Let's see how well it's going to work. Pick a partner and practice passing. For if you pass proficiently, perhaps you'll play professionally. Picky people pick Peter Pan peanut butter. Peter Pan peanut is the peanut picky people. What? Peter Pan peanut is the peanut picky people pick. Oh, good it. Biggy people pick Peter Pan peanut butter. Peter Pan peanut is the peanut picky people pick. Yeah. So yeah, there you go. You know whether it's working or not. It's Saturday night now. I've got myself a beer. The curry is in the oven and I've just been finishing off some of the editing for this here video. If you've made it this far, thank you very much. You're a true book because it's not the most exciting video in the world. Again, just want to reiterate my thanks to you all for watching, for liking, for commenting, subscribing and everything else. If you've got any feedback, as always, pop comment below. If there's anything you'd like to see, let me know if you've got any ideas for the channel, comment below. I always read the comments and I always try and reply where I can. If there's a particular video you'd like to see, again, let me know and if I can make it, I will certainly try to. Hopefully 2019 is going to be a good one. The channel's been doing quite well recently. It's been growing quite quickly. So fingers crossed, we can keep that going and we'll see what happens really. I hope you all have a good weekend and I may try making another video tomorrow so you might see more of me, but if not, I will certainly be back on Friday for a five minute Friday. Take it easy guys. Thanks for all your support and thanks again for watching this one. See ya!
