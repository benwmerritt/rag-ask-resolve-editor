Grow your online business today with this video sponsor, Squarespace. What up folks, welcome to the news with me, Alex, the YouTuber with his eye to the ground. Every week we'll do an update talking about all the exciting things going on with DaVinci Resolve, Blackmagic Design, Cameras, General Technology and everything in between. This one though is a Blackmagic heavy kind of week. So first up we've got the Resolve update. DaVinci Resolve has been updated to 18.1.4. This was released on Monday, the 6th of March. This is an incremental update, it mostly just has bug fixes so there's nothing too exciting to report. All of the new additions are on screen right now so you can take a peek. If you're one of those few that's in desperate need of support for monochrome decode mode for your ARRI raw clips, then you're in luck. But for everyone else it's mostly just some performance increases, bug fixes and general stability. Which, never a bad thing, it's just not particularly exciting. Next up, all of the training documentation from Blackmagic Design has been updated to DaVinci Resolve 18. So if you didn't know, there were some really fantastic training resources for DaVinci Resolve in the form of Blackmagic's own training books. Now you can buy physical copies if that's something you'd like to do or you can just download the PDF completely for free from Blackmagic's own website. I've linked that down below so you can go and check it out. Now these training books are full in-depth guides to all the different areas of DaVinci Resolve. And most of them come with training files so you can follow along and online exams to prove that you've completed them. Which is pretty cool. Now up until very recently they were for DaVinci Resolve 17 but they've recently updated them to DaVinci Resolve 18 so everything is now up to date. So if you're new to DaVinci Resolve and you prefer that style of training then definitely go check them out because they're a really, really brilliant resource. So continuing with another piece of news from Blackmagic Design, they have announced some price drops. On Wednesday 1st March 2023 Blackmagic Design today announced a new lower price for Blackmagic Cloudstore Network Storage. The Blackmagic Cloudstore Mini 8TB is now reduced to $2,355. The Blackmagic Cloudstore 20TB is now reduced to $7,595. And the Blackmagic Cloudstore 80TB is reduced to $22,995. That's a reduction of $7,000 for the most expensive one. Now if you're not familiar with the Cloudstore models, here's what Blackmagic says. The Blackmagic Cloudstore is storage that syncs and shares media with Dropbox and Google Drive. It even understands proxy workflows so a whole timeline and its media can be shared in minutes. The internal memory core is so fast that it can saturate the 10GB Ethernet ports to their theoretical maximum speed even with multiple users connected. That's why it's perfect for sharing media between editors, colorists, audio engineers and visual effects artists. Basically, the network connected storage devices that are just super fast. So you can have multiple people editing an entire project with the media files stored on this Cloudstore device and they will of course also sync to the cloud. Now that's also the reason why they're so expensive compared to a standard off the shelf NAS, a network accessible storage drive, and it's because it's using flash storage. Super fast SSDs essentially and 80TB of flash storage is going to be fairly expensive. Now these devices are kind of out of reach for most regular smo's like you and me, but I felt it was newsworthy because of one particular line. They had this to say, the reduction of up to $7,000 has been made possible by better pricing on the high speed flash storage components. Now it's a real simple line, but again, it's just a very black magic thing, which is much appreciated. They're managing to build them for cheaper thanks to cheaper components. So they're passing that saving, maybe not all of it, but at least a big chunk of it over to you, me, us, the consumers. Now they don't have to do that. They could have just pocketed a larger profit, but instead they're passing the savings over, which is always a good thing. Now that does explain why there's no cost change to the cheaper, most accessible version, which is the black magic cloud pod. This doesn't actually have any internal storage. You just plug in your own SSD. So no savings on the flash storage. The cloud pod is staying the same price, but overall, good job, black magic. Like they care what I think, they don't, but great job anyway. It's always good to see.

Grand Petty has said that black magic design had aggressively increased its investment in new products. Now, yes, this is really vague, so we probably can't get too excited. But again, based on speculation, it's always fun. It just potentially means we're going to be getting some more goodies from black magic design. Maybe some more pocket cameras coming soon because people are desperate for a new pocket camera, or maybe the new box camera that everyone has been waiting for. And with NAB literally next month, which where black magic have historically announced tons of new things, could we be getting something new? Who knows? Let me know what you think down below. Now, this information comes from AV Magazine and The Australian, but I've also linked an article from YM Cinema dot com down below because they summarize it all really, really nicely. Now, apparently the information actually came from black magic designs annual report. Petty added that black magic design had aggressively increased its investment in new products during the last financial year, working on multiple new technologies. Now, the actual big headline for all of this was the fact that black magic are struggling with supply chain issues with some components having lead times of more than 12 months. Now, the article actually covers something else really interesting about black magic, which I never knew. Maybe it's not that interesting to you, but it's interesting to me. Black magic actually manufactures all of its products in house. They fully own their entire production. And as black magic design builds its products based on demand, most of its inventory is in parts rather than finished products. So they do everything themselves. They just get the bits in and they put it all together. So there you go. Just some interesting insights into black magic design. So what do you think? Do you think we're going to get something new from black magic at NAB in April? I sure hope so because I will be there myself for the very first time. So that'd be really cool. Let me know what you think down below. Thanks for watching. Make sure to catch me next week for more news. Take it easy. See you later.
