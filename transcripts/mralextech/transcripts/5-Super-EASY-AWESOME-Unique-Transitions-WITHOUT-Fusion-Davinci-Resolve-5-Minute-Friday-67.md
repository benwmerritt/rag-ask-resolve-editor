What up folks? It's Alex. Welcome to Five Minute Friday and yes, in this video I'm going to show you how to create all of those different transitions you've just seen in just five minutes in DaVinci Resolve using only the built-in video transitions. Now to cram this all into five minutes I do speak a little bit quicker than usual but hopefully it's all okay and everyone can follow along. Now I'm using DaVinci Resolve 16.2 in order to save the transitions presets you do need to be on Resolve 16.2. Right without the way let's open DaVinci Resolve and take a look shall we? So here we are in DaVinci Resolve and we're on the edit tab. Now first thing we're going to do open up the effects library, expand the toolbox and then we're going to video transitions and we're going to start up nice and easy you just grab a blur dissolve which is going to put that onto our timeline like so and now if we hit play we've got this simple blur dissolve transition give it a click open up the inspector in the top right hand corner and then you should see these options we're going to come down to the bottom here and you've got the blur dissolve options if you don't want it to be horizontal what you can do is just increase the vertical strength to match the horizontal strength and now we've got this standard blur transition instead. Now another thing you can change change this on all transitions to make them look better is the ease if we change it from non to in and out we get a curve in the transition which just makes it look a whole lot better now if that blur is too strong what you can do just bring that down just make sure the horizontal and the vertical are the same and then you've got the same thing again just with a little less blur. Now once you've made any amendments what you can do is right click on the transition on your timeline create a transition preset and we'll call this blur dissolve preset and click on okay and then in the video transitions within the effects library if we scroll down you've got user and the blur dissolve preset will be in there ready for future use. Another easy one the non additive dissolve this is basically like a lumafade transition so going to put that on there and if we hit play we've got this real simple lumafade style transition if we give that a click again in the inspector I'm going to change the ease to in and out and what I like to do for this one is to increase the length cover about two seconds seems to work well and there we've got a real nice lumafade style transition. Next one we're going to scroll down until we see the oval iris and we're going to drag that one on which looks like this which isn't too bad but in my eyes it's a little bit dated so we're just going to make some changes firstly give it a click open up the inspector and we're going to change the ease to in and out sounds to do for all of these and then we hit play it looks a little better but there's a few other things we can do first thing I like to do is to add a border so if we just come to the border here we can increase that now by default as you can see the color of that border is white if we click on the little panel here we can just change that color to whatever we want it to be come down to here where you've got pick screen color and then what you can do is just move your mouse over a prominent color even in your second clip so mine's got lots of blue going on so we're going to go for a dark blue and then click and then click on okay and then the color of the border will match some of the colors in the second clip which can really make this transition pop. This is also a really great one if you're doing information videos or product reviews on YouTube. Next up we've got the center wipe transition so I'm just going to grab that put that one on there and we get this which is a wipe sort of reveal again if we change to in and out it looks a little bit better now again for this one I like to add a border but what we're actually going to do is keyframe the border this time so put your playhead in the middle of the transition click on this little diamond next to border to add a keyframe and then we're going to make the border the size we want it to be so I'm going to go with that and then I'm going to scroll my playhead to the beginning of the transition and we're going to bring that border to zero get to right to the end of the transition and bring that to zero again so now the border will slowly get bigger as the transition goes forwards and then smaller towards the end and it looks something like this now there's another quick use for this center wipe transition so I'm just going to delete this clip so we've just got a one clip here with nothing in front of it but then going to grab the center wipe transition put that on there make it a little bit longer we're then going to change the ease to in and out now that on its own works quite well but what we can also do is just change the angle to 90 degrees and then we've got this real nice cinematic opening transition and then last but not least just a couple down we've got edge wipe we're going to just put that one on there or hit play it looks something like that and again all we can do change the ease to in and out if I set the angle to 30 it gives us a nice corner to corner transition and again I'm going to animate a border so I'm going to come right in the middle we'll give this one a bit of a border here we're then going to keyframe that go to the beginning take that to zero go to the end back to zero and we've got this corner to corner transition with a white line which looks really quite nice and professional and that's it for this one I hope you enjoyed this video if you did give me a thumbs up any comments or feedback as I always pop them down below and don't forget to subscribe if you're new around here thanks ever so much for watching take it easy I'll see you next time bye
