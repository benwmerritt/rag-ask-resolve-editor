This is my mask by the way. Ta-da! I'm just starting wearing cravat for no reason. That'll be weird. What up folks, Alex here. I've got a new lens. This is a Yongee Mitokon 17mm f0.95. So it's a super fast manual lens for the micro 4 thirds system which of course my Lumix G9 is just that. So I decided to pick it up because it looked cool and it's fully manual and I fancied having to play with a fully manual lens because I haven't had one in ages. Now this isn't a sponsored video. First of all I bought this because I thought it looked cool and it's also this isn't a review. I've only had it for a few days and just wanted to get out and film with it. I've got a variable ND filter on there because I'm going to need that to keep this at 0.95. I'm going to try and film most of this video wide open because you buy a 0.95 lens to use it at 0.95. So we're going to try and shoot wide open for most of this video so you guys can see how it all looks. Alright I think I'm roughly in focus. If I stay right here. This was just over £300. £320 I paid for it which is a bit of a steal for a 0.95 lens. Now saying that I looked on Amazon yesterday and it's gone up to like £480 or £400 something grid. But I think that's because it's the last one. I think they're just taking a risk and going. Brought the price up. We've only got one left in stock. I'd imagine when they get more in the price should come back down. A bit of a steal for such a fast lens. Obviously manual focusing especially when you're trying to manually focus on yourself is a little bit difficult at 0.95 but it's a bit of fun. A bit of a challenge. So we're just going to see how it goes. Alright. Seen a bit. Ah. Oh, bit dark. Alright we're done. Turn to the gym. Going to stroll into town. Get some lunch. Shooting at 2.8 at the minute. Service catch. Alright. Now obviously it's not a vlogging lens but if you stop it down a bit you sort of can vlog on it. It's a bit long. I mean 35 but it sort of works. I'm at 2.8 and it just helps with focus because obviously I'm manually focusing. I can sort of adjust my focus with my hands as we go. But not very well. Alright. Alright. Now if you stop it down, so I'm shooting at f4 now, it's actually not that bad to film yourself on. You have to sit your focus before hand obviously. But it kind of works. 17mm at something like f4, f5.6 on micro for a third. Plainly depth of field. It's quite easy to actually set and forget. I'm shooting at 4K 50 frames per second for most of this with a bit of obviously 4K 25. Generally speaking it's a 4K 50 because then I can keep my 1, 100th of a second shutter speed. There's loads and loads of light. Trying to shoot at 0.95 at 1.50th of a second. The ND is sort of maxing out and we get a bit of vignette in and whatever else. So 4K 50 seems to work better. There you go. I just slapped it on a 25 frames per second timeline. Job done. It still looked pretty good. So what's it like to focus? Well it's actually pretty easy. Especially on the G9. Modern cameras, especially mirrorless these days, they're just a dothel anyway. Because you've got the focus peaking, you've got the magnification. It's not that hard to focus even at 0.95. Obviously I'm not really tracking much. I'm just doing some focus pulls, making sure things are relatively sharp and it's relatively easy. If you're trying to follow some fast action obviously it's going to be a little bit more difficult but it's honestly not too bad. The fact that it's a proper manual focus ring just makes life so much easier. It's really heavily damped so you've got stops at either end so you know when you're at infinite or when you're at the macro side of things. It's just a doddle honestly. I'm saying that. I'm hoping that most of this vlog is actually in focus. If it's all out of focus then it's really hard to focus. But no, the G9, honestly the focus peaking on the G9 is wicked. And that monitor is way brighter than I thought it was honestly. Never really thought too much about it but I'm out here. It's bright sunlight and I can see the focus peaking. Which is really cool so I can make sure that things are in focus just by checking the peaking. I can check in the magnification if I want to. I've got it mapped to one of my custom buttons so I just hit a button, I can double check it, hit that, start recording and job done. So yeah, not that bad. Loads of fun though. That's the more important thing. It's just fun. Manual focus is fun. If you've never tried it, if you've never played with a manual focus lens, pick one up. If you're shooting Sony you can get adapters for old Canon FD lenses. And they're dirt cheap, little adapters and they work really well. When I first moved to Sony I picked up a Sony A7. I couldn't afford any of the Sony lenses so I bought a load of old Canon FD manual focus lenses. I had a 28mm, a 135mm and a 50mm. And they were great. Again, turn the focus peaking on and off the gear. Loads of fun. I still fit on playgrounds. So there's something else really cool about shooting with a manual lens and by manual I mean manual aperture. So you control the aperture entirely from the lens itself. So if you've got an aperture ring, you move that to go from F9.5 to F1.4 to 2.8 to 5.6, whatever. You can just control it using that ring. Which is cool for a couple of reasons. So number one, it means that basically you control your exposure entirely using the lens. You very rarely need to touch the camera itself other than the record button. So you set your ISO in camera, you set your shutter speed in camera and then that's it. You leave it. So when I'm out shooting, I can control my depth of field with my aperture ring. If I knock my aperture down to something like F2.8, I then adjust the exposure using my variable ND. So I just rotate them to compensate for each other. Which is cool. So you never have to touch a button on your camera. You just look at the screen to make sure you're in focus. You look at the screen to make your exposure good. If you want to adjust your exposure, you can either use the aperture ring if you want to change your aperture. Or if you want to stick wide open, let's say 0.95, then you just change your variable ND filter until the image on screen looks about right. And that's a really cool way to work. You just never have to touch any buttons you do all on the lens and that's kind of fun. And then the other cool thing with that is for me at least, when you're moving something physical and you can see something happening when you move it, and you see the depth of field changing on screen, you see the image getting darker. It just causes that link. It causes that cognitive link in your brain. So you've got a better understanding of what's going on. I find with digital cameras and stuff these days, when you just move a dial and numbers change, you're like, what's that doing? But when you've got a physical ring and you can see it opening up, closing, etc. For me, it just instills it in my brain and I go, oh, I know what's going on now. So they're fun, but they're also a good learning tool. You learn a lot while you're playing with them. So there you go. That's what I think. Anyway, you might think that's a load of rubbish. Might be. This is my mask, by the way. Tada. I haven't just started wearing cravat for no reason. That'd be weird. So this is one of the weird characteristics of this lens. This is not the ND filter, trust me, that flare. So let me knock it down a bit. So see that flare? I'm shooting at 0.95. If I twist my aperture, just a smidge, it goes away. And back in, it goes away. You only get that real big, obvious circular flare right in the middle at 0.95. It also changes the hue. We go from a slightly pink issue wide open, a slightly green hue. Just when you step down the aperture a tiny bit, it's slightly odd. But I don't hate it. That's me, done. Anyway, I'm back home. It's really hot. It's really hot for UK weather. It's like 25 degrees or something, which for us Brits is equivalent to 50 degrees everywhere up. We don't deal with the heat generally. So I'm going to chill out. Dogs have just had some fun with the houseboat, so they were all cooled down. Yeah, this lens is really fun. I've really enjoyed playing with it today. I've taken out the other day and had a play with it. I had loads of fun then. So I'm really looking forward to just doing more with it, having some fun with it. I really like the way it renders stuff. It's not perfect. It's actually full of imperfections and that's kind of what I like. But it's really fun to use. I'm going to keep using it. And hopefully I'll keep doing more of these vlogs because it's fun. I like doing them. There are some links if you want to check out the gear that I use to make these vlogs. It's all down in the description below, but whatever. So thanks for watching. Take it easy. I'll catch you next time.
