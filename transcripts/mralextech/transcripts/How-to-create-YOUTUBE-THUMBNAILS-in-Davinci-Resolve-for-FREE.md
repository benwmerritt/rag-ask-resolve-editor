This video is brought to you by Skillshare. Thumbnails. If you're a YouTuber, you're going to need to make thumbnails. But did you know you can actually create those thumbnails in DaVinci Resolve itself? Even the free version. It's super quick, simple, and easy. First things first, let me show you how to get set up and ready. Now you can either do this in a brand new project or an existing project. I'm in this existing project in DaVinci Resolve. I'm on the edit page. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to click on file and then I'm going to go to new timeline. So we're going to create a new timeline specifically for our thumbnail. I'm going to call this timeline thumbnail and then I'm just going to untick this use project settings. Then I'm going to go to the format tab and in timeline resolution, just set this to be 1280 by 720 HD 720p. We don't need to worry about the timeline frame rates because that doesn't matter. Then we're just going to hit create. And now we've got our timeline, which is ready for creating our YouTube thumbnail. Then I can just import any of the media that we need. I've already got some PNGs in here, some videos, as well as some still images. So now we can start creating. And we're going to start off looking at backgrounds. Now there's loads of different options for your thumbnail background in DaVinci Resolve. You could create a freeze frame from a video. You could import a still, sort of a photograph or whatever. Or you could create your own colored background just using a solid color generator. So let's start off with a freeze frame. In here, I've got this video and it's just some B rather I took of this laptop. And I want to use a freeze frame of this as my background. So all I'm going to do on my timeline, I'm just going to find the point where I want to create a little freeze frame as still image. So I'm going to go with something like that. Put your play head in the exact point that you want it. So mine's right there. Then open up the inspector, top right hand corner. Come on down to this speed change area. If you don't see the options under there, click on the word speed change. And then in direction, you've got this little snowflake icon. Give that a click and everything after your play head on the timeline will be your freeze frame. So now I can just delete this first section. I can make this as short or as long as I want. And I've got this freeze frame, which is ready to be a background image of thumbnail. If you wanted a solid color background, simply open up your effects library by clicking on effects, top left hand corner. Come on down to the generators area. And within there, you've got a few options. You've got a four color gradient, which just allows you to put different colors in all of the different corners to create a nice look like so. Or you've got a solid color. If that wanna click, drag it on my timeline, make it a little bit longer. Give it a click so it's highlighted. In the inspector, once again, go to video generator, and then you've got color. Change that to whatever color you want it to be. And then you've got yourself a nice colored background. Or you could simply import an image or a screenshot. If you take a look at a lot of my thumbnails, I actually use a screenshot of DaVinci Resolve as the background. But I do like to mess around with the pitch and the yord just to make it pop a little bit more. So let me show you how I do that. Now this is really simple. It will work for any image, but I've got this image here. It's just a screenshot of a plain DaVinci Resolve project. So I'm just gonna lengthen this out. We're gonna give it a click on the timeline. In the inspector, we've got transform options. What I like to do, I'm gonna zoom in. I'm gonna change the position. So let's say I'm talking about these effects down here. And then I just like to add a little bit of pitch and then a little bit of yord. I usually go for more yord than there is pitch. And it just adds this really nice sort of 3D effect. Now the last thing you might want to do is just to blur that background just a little bit. So I've still got my screenshot here. I'm gonna open up my effects library once again. Then we're simply gonna go to the open effects area. And right at the very top, we've got all of our blur options within here. Grab the Gaussian blur third from the top and just drop it on your image like so. And then you'll get a nice blurred image like that. With the image selected on your timeline, open up the inspector, go to the effects tab and then you've got your Gaussian blur within there. Give it a click to see the options underneath. And then you've got your horizontal and vertical strength. Just bring those down or up to adjust the amount of blur for your background. So it just fades away, looks really smooth and it's just gonna make my text and any images on top really pop. One thing I like to do all the time is to add PNGs. Arrows, little circles, little images on top just to add a little bit of extra flourish. But there's one thing I like to add to those again just to make them pop. So I've got my blurry background. Now we wanna add our PNG. So I've got this arrow in my media pool. It's gonna pop this on the timeline and lengthen it out. If we give it a click in the inspector, we're gonna use the standard transform tools just to make it a bit smaller and get it in the right position. But it doesn't pop off the screen. So we need to make a few amendments to make it stand out a bit. So from your effects library, go to the open effects area once again and then you wanna scroll down until you get to the resolve FX stylized area and you've got one here called drop shadow. Click, drag and drop that on your PNG like so. If you go to the inspector and then effects, you've got your drop shadow controls within here. First thing I'm gonna do, I'm gonna change the color. Now if you run a light background, a drop shadow will work perfectly or look really nice to give it a 3D effect. This is quite a dark background so I want it to actually be a different color. So I'm gonna click on color. Then I fancy this to be kind of red. So I'm gonna go with a nice bright red and then click on okay. So now I've got this red sort of glow around the outside. Now I like to do this. I'm gonna put these strength all the way up and then I'm gonna increase the blur and then I'm just gonna change the angle to be something like that. Now it doesn't look like a drop shadow. It just looks like the arrows got really nice red glow around it. It's really quick and easy to do and makes things pop. I could change the color to be whatever I want. Let's go with a teal instead and it looks something like that. And now for a real quick message from this video's sponsor, Skillshare. Skillshare is an online learning community with thousands of inspiring classes for anyone who loves learning and wants to explore their creativity and learn new skills. I personally am always looking to learn and develop new skills, especially around YouTube and productivity. And if you're watching these videos, then I guess you're looking to learn as well and Skillshare is a great place to start. They've got everything from photography and video editing to maximizing productivity and learning how to create and grow your very own YouTube channel. I've been watching YouTube success, script, shoot and edit with MKBHD by Marquez Brownlee, which is a fantastic course covering everything from researching new topics to planning visuals and of course, creating thumbnails, all of which is helping me to up my own YouTube game. So check out the link down in the description below. The first 1000 people to use that link will get a one month free trial to Skillshare. So check it out. Now next up, we've got text and text is super simple too, but a quick word on fonts. All the fonts that appear within DaVinci Resolve is simply the fonts which you've got installed to your device, be it Windows, Linux or Mac. So if you want any new fonts, go and download them off the internet. There's loads of free sites available. Just a few examples, DaFonts 1001 free fonts or you can just go to fonts.google.com and download some from there. There's some links down in the description below. So I've got a font here, I downloaded it, it's a dot zip. So I'm just gonna double click. I've got an orange choose TTF, which is a true type font file. We're gonna double click that. This preview window will open and then we've got the option to install at the top. So we're just gonna install that and job done. Now it won't appear in DaVinci Resolve until we restart it. So let's just restart this now. Now we're back in Resolve. So I'm gonna open my effects library. We're gonna go to titles. We're just gonna grab a simple text and put this on top like so. Let's lengthen this out. Now if I go to my font family, we should now have one simply called orange juice. It's all installed and it's all ready to go. Then you just need to add your text to your thumbnail and customize it until you're happy. Now I always use this standard text one because it's easier, quicker and simpler to use. Give it a click in the inspector. We've got title and then we've got all of our options within here. So first things first, I'm gonna change the text to say click me and then we've got all of our controls. So I'm just gonna change the font to something different that I like. Let's go with a monster at and then we can change things like the color, the size, the tracking. I like to reduce the tracking just to bring it closer together. Let's make it a little bit bigger. We can change the alignment if we want it to be left justified, for example. Loads of fun controls within here. So just adjust everything to get it looking exactly as you want it. Another quick tip, if you click on settings at the top, you can actually jump to the pitch and the your as well. So you can change the pitch and the your just to give that text a slightly different look. Hop it back over to the title tab. If you scroll down, you've got this thing here called stroke. Now, if we change the color, let's just go with a nice bright red and click on okay. And then if we increase the size, that gives us this colored border around our text. And again, it makes it stand out from the background. Underneath that, we've got drop shadow. So all you want to do here, increase the offset. This changes the position of that drop shadow so we can just move it wherever we want it. And then we've got controls like the blur and the opacity. If you want to give it more of a glow like we did with that arrow, just change the color to whatever you want. Let's go with this again. We're going to reset the offset by double clicking and then just give it the tiniest amount of offset. Give it loads of blur, make it really obvious. And then we've got something that looks like that. Now, another real quick tip just while we're in here, you can actually change the settings for the text independently. So if I highlight click within this rich text, we can change the font purely for that click rather than the word me. And you can just combine different fonts. That also works for things like the sizing, the tracking and all the other options within here, which again, just allows you to further customize this title to get it looking exactly as you want it. And that's pretty much the basics of your YouTube thumbnail. Done. But if you want to get a bit fancy and start cutting things out, you can do that as well using the color page. So for those that want that, let's take a look. Now you can either use a freeze frame or a still image for this. I'm going to use a still image. So I'm just going to drag this on, put it on top like so, we'll lengthen this out. This is just a cheesy picture of me doing a thumbs up. And we want to just get rid of the background so it's just me. So we're going to give it a click on our timeline and then we're going to jump into the color tab across the bottom. Now, all you need to do, come down to this little bar right in the middle and click on this little circle with the four dots. And this will open up your windows area down here. Near the bottom, we've got this pen icon. Give that a click and it'll go red. And then within your preview window, all you need to do is to cut out your subject. So you can go as fast or as slow as you like for this. And all you want to do is just click along the line, like so, just cutting your subject out. If you're using a mouse with a middle mouse wheel, you can just scroll in and then click and hold that mouse to move things around so you can see what you're doing with some detail. If you've clicked a dot and you've got it wrong, you can actually just click and move them to get them in the right spot. So I'm going to move this one up. Now, if you've never used a pen tool before, it's really simple. You just click to add these straight lines. If you need to make a curved line, click and hold your mouse when you click and then just drag it around and you can add sort of little curves to it to get it looking as exactly as you want it. Now, I'm going to be quite quick for this. I'm just going to whizz through really roughly to cut me out, something like that. Once I'm done, I just need to join the ends up and we've created a mask. Now, there's a few different things you can do at this point. You can either get rid of the background completely, making it transparent, or you can just select the foreground and the background independently to apply some separate effects. Maybe you're trying to blur the background, that sort of thing. I'm going to show you both methods. Use little chapters to skip to the one that you want. If you want to get rid of the background completely, it's really simple. On your nodes area here, simply right click any empty space and then go to add an alpha output. And then you get this little blue dot up here down here. Then simply click on this blue square, drag it down to this little blue circle and release. And now we've got rid of our background. We've just got me. Now, we've still got all of these lines and dots and it's kind of distracting. You can't see what's going on. So underneath your preview window, you've got this little drop down, turn that to off, and then you can see your handiwork. And even though I was quite quick, I didn't do a bad job at all. Let's zoom right in. You can see it's a little bit jagged here. Still within your windows area, you've got softness, soft one. Simply drag this upwards to add a little bit of softness and it'll just soften that edge like so and look immediately much, much better. Now, before we jump into the edit page, what I like to do from here, click on effects top right hand corner and you've got your effects. Scroll down to the same place as we did before on the edit page, the resolve stylized area, grab a drop shadow, plonk him on there and now we've got a nice little drop shadow as well. Customize it to get it looking exactly as you want it. You can even add the same colors we did before if you want to have a nice little glow. And there you go. Then if we jump back onto the edit page, we can just use the transform effects to move this around to get it looking wherever we want it, like so. Simple. Now, if you want to start doing some selective editing or coloring, so maybe you want to blur something in the foreground or background, once you've selected your target, like so, your subject, like this, all you then need to do on your node area here, right click the node and then go to add node and then you want to add an outside node. And now we've got two nodes here, like so. This first one is our subject, so the thing we've got selected. And our second one is everything but a subject. So what I can do here, I'm going to open up my effects top right hand corner. Then I'm just going to grab my Gaussian blur, the same as we did on the edit page earlier, and we're going to drop that on this outside node and it's going to make all of the background much blurrier. And then we can just adjust the strength of that blur so that I really pop out like so. We can then go to our inside, our main one here. I'm going to turn off these lines so I can see what I'm doing a little bit better by clicking on this little drop down underneath our preview window and then going to off. If we scroll in, we can see I did a pretty good job on the cutting out, but I want to just soften that edge a little bit. So again, we're going to go to softness down here within the power window, just increase that to soften that edge like so. And now from here, we can do some selective coloring. Maybe I want to increase the contrast of me without increasing the contrast of the rest. And we can do something that looks like that. Now, another quick example for something like that could be this, I'm showing a project, but I don't want it to be as obvious as this. I want to blur the subjects just a little bit. So I'm on the edit page. I'm going to give it a click, hop onto the color page, go down to our power window, grab my pen tool. We're just going to do this really quickly. We're going to select my can, something like that. And then again, from the effects library, I could grab the Gaussian blur, but I want to make it a bit different. I'm going to go with this mosaic blur, drop that on my node, and now we've blurred out our can like so. Let's increase the softness, and then we can go to our mosaic options, change how that looks. Let's go with something like that. Hop back onto the edit page, put our arrow on there, and our text just by putting them above our layer. And then we've got something that looks like that. Now, the last step obviously is exporting it. I'm back on the edit page. All you need to do, make sure your play head is in the right place. So you're selecting not over here where there's nothing. You just want to make sure that your thumbnail looks correct. So I'm going to go with this. We're simply going to jump onto the color page. Now, it doesn't actually matter what's going on anywhere else on the screen. The only thing we care about really is this preview window here. Then all you're going to do simply right click your mouse on the preview and grab the still, the top option. Then open up your gallery. So clicking on gallery, top left hand corner, and you can see the still that you've taken within there. Then on that still, simply right click, and then you want to go to export. And now I'll ask you where you want to save this. So I'm just going to find the folder where I want to locate it. And then it's really important that you change this save as type from DPX, which is the default to either a JPEG or a PNG. Doesn't matter which, I'm just going to go with a JPEG. I'm going to call this thumbnail, and then I'm going to hit export. And then if I just go to that folder, I've got a thumbnail, JPEG. And if I open that up, at 720p, thumbnail is ready to go. Then we just need to upload this to YouTube on our video and job done. Easy peasy, YouTube thumbnails, individual resolve.
