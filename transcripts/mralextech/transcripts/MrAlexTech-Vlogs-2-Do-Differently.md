I shaved my head. I look like a bit of an egg, don't I? I've always fancied just getting rid of it and seeing how it looks. But I've never had because of work, but I'm not in work for a few weeks. So I thought, sod it, got rid of all the hair. Well, let's say shaved. It's the shortest it's ever been. Our lives are a little bit different at the moment. The way we shop, the way we work, everything is different. So today, I'm building on that and I'm just doing things differently. So, let's rewind a bit, shall we? I'm currently at home and I'm going to be at home for the next few weeks. If you don't know if you're not from the UK, UK has essentially put on lockdown for a few weeks. We're allowed to go out for medical emergencies, to go to the shops sort of once a week to get the essentials, and then one form of exercise per day. And that's pretty much it. So we're stuck at home. Now, realistically, this is the worst time ever to start trying to vlog, because I'm stuck inside. But I figured, why not? I've got nothing else to do really. I am still working, as I say, I'm working during the day. But I've need to kill some time, need to keep myself amused. So let's start a bit of a vlog. Yeah. This hair... It's getting a bit long. Obviously, I didn't realise we'd be stuck inside for a while. So as I'm not at work, not going to be around. Not going to be doing a huge amount for a few weeks. It's time for some drastic measures, I think. Now, Becky, my lovely wife dear, is not so keen on this idea. So, yeah. Right, to get Becky happy, at least initially, we're going to go a bit longer than I might end up going. I don't know what I'm doing. Never cut my own hair. Number four. Number three. Number four. Number four. Number four. Now this is an interesting look. Look at that. I'm just going to see what Becky thinks. You're not leaving it like that, are you? Let me take a bit and put it in the group. What's happened to the back? Oh, I can't see. Oh, God. I'm obviously not leaving it like that. What's the back like? No, let me take a picture of the back. I wish I could make this as early as I could, big bit out in the front. No, I just get one there. Why? Because you'll look silly if you leave a bit. Do you prefer this one? Yeah, you like this one. Unicorn on the streets, rhino in the sheets. Got a bad for a first attempt, I don't think. Right, we've had a lot of fun. Esda, time to clean up. So we're out now with the dog, taking in for a quick walk. My one bout of exercise per day walking the dog. And look how nice it is. Literally, these are the first few nice days we've had in the UK. Oh, yeah. And everyone's stuck inside. Typical, isn't it, really? So, do things differently. What am I talking about? Hang on, hang on. So yeah, think differently. Or do differently. Think and do things differently. The days you remember through life, or when you do something different, or when you do something fun, something different happens. And they stand out. You know the secret of when you try and remember something. So if you need to remember that you turned the oven off, or that you picked up your keys, or that you locked the door, they always say, do something differently. When you go and lock the door, do a little dance. Tap yourself on the head, take your glasses off, tap yourself on the shoe, standing your tiptoes, whatever it may be. Do something you wouldn't usually do when locking the door or turning the oven off. And it just helps you to remember that you've done that thing. I've only been at home for a week. I've got another three to go. And already the days are starting to merge into one. And I know that in three weeks' time, I'll have lost three weeks of my life, and nothing, I would have achieved nothing. I'll have no memories, because it's all just a blur of one big mess. So if each day I can just do something a little bit different. It doesn't have to be as drastic as shaving your head, but now's a good time to shave your head if you've ever felt like it. Grow your hair, grow a beard, have a moustache, whatever it may be. Now's a good time. Try something different for dinner, if you can. Watch something different on TV that you always thought you disliked. Just try something a little bit different to make each day stand out from the rest. And then hopefully, by the end of this, you'll have some memories. You'll have some things to remind yourself of this time, and not in a negative way. But the tiny little positive, those little wins each day, but you didn't expect the things that stand out, the things that make memories. So yeah, do things differently. It might be nonsense, it might not make a blind bit of difference, but it's something I'm going to try, hopefully it will make a difference. We shall see. A bit of an experiment really, so... Yeah, we've got nothing bad to do, have we? So we might as well try these things. Right, I'm done. Well, we're done with our daily exercise for the day. So we're going to shoot back. One thing I do want to say, as you all know, I don't really vlog that much. I like vloggers. There's some specific vloggers that I really like. The vloggers I don't like, the lifestyle vloggers are those that become really preachy and like the sound of their own voice a bit much. At the end of the day, I'm just a random dude that makes stuff on YouTube. I'm not an expert in, well, in anything, really. So if this video did come across preachy, like I'm talking down to you or whatever, let me know in the comments below. I'd really like to know your feedback. I also don't usually do these out in public, but I think there's not many people around. I figured I might as well try. Might be a good time to get used to talking to a camera outside the house as well. So yeah, let me know down in the comments below. I'd love to know your thoughts. Now I've got to go find a dog, put him back in the lead, and we'll head home. Come on. Good boy. Stay there. Stay there. She's a good boy. And there you go. That's it folks. Now, as you can probably tell, I'm going to upload these videos, warts and all. They're going to be real life, I may make mistakes, I may miss things. I think sometimes that's the best way to learn to just put yourself out there and just sort of work from there. There'll be warts and all. As I improve, hopefully I can do some more fun elements, add some different things, some cinematic b-roll and all that sort of stuff, but I'm just taking it one step at a time, trying to get used to certain bits before I try and start doing anything too fancy. So yeah, I hope you enjoyed the video. If you did, thumbs up. Any comments or feedback down below. Do let me know your situation. Do let me know if there's anything I can do for you guys while I'm here. Anything I can do to help people out there in the same situation or worse situation as me, I'm all here. So let me know. Thank you for watching guys. I'll see you next time. Bye!
