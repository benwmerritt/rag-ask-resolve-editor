Super simple time saving quick tips for beginners in DaVinci Resolve 18. Way because we all know that starting any new system can be frustrating in DaVinci Resolve is no different, but it doesn't have to with these quick tips and maybe an effect or two from this video sponsor, MotionVFX, you'll be whizzing through projects in no time. And we're going to start off setting your project, setting defaults and custom presets. When you open DaVinci Resolve, the first thing you should be doing is coming down to the bottom right hand corner clicking on the little cog to open up your project settings and then within master settings setting your time and run resolution and your time line frame rate plus anything else that you need. Now you don't actually need to do this every single time because you can set a default. So mine here, time and run resolution is Ultra HD. I'm just going to change this to 1080p. I'm going to keep it as 30 frames per second. If I want this to be the default, so the standard one that loads every time we boot into DaVinci Resolve, we simply click on the three little dots top right hand corner, go to set current settings as default preset. That'll ask me if I want to update, I'll click update. And that's it. Every time we opened DaVinci Resolve, these settings will appear. Now obviously that's not always what you want. So then you can also set presets. From this little menu on the left, you can see presets at the top. What you want to do while in the master settings, set your time and run resolution and your frame rate to whatever you want it to be. So I'm just going to go with 4K, 25 for this example. Then we're going to click on presets. What we need to do first of all is hit save. That'll just save any settings that you've just changed to make sure that they're ready to go. And then we hit save as, give it a name. I'm going to call this 4K, 25 and then OK. And that'll save that preset within the preset. So at any time we can give it a click, load that in and that'll load the 4K, 25 to our current project. Simple, way easier to mess around with your project settings every single time. Next up, importing media. Now I know this sounds obvious, but there's actually a couple of useful little tricks to show you here as well. So we're on the edit page and I've got my media pool open over here. Now you probably know that if you right click, you can go to import media, find any footage and just import it as you need to. But you can also drag and drop. So I've got this folder here and I can grab anything, I can highlight it, simply drag it in and it will copy it to DaVinci Resolve. But you can actually do the entire folder structure as well. So I'm going to go back one level. I'm going to grab this laptop folder and I'm going to just drag it in. But rather than dropping it here within the media pool, we're going to drop it over to here on the little shelf on the left. And what that's going to do is import all of the footage. So we've got our main laptop folder with everything within there, but then also import any folders. It will copy the folder structure from Windows or Mac or whatever you're using and create bins within your media pool within DaVinci Resolve. So it just makes life a little bit easier. Now this isn't actually linked to the folder on your operating system. So if I go and change it within Windows, it won't reflect within here, but it's just a real nice way of staying organized. Now a real quick bonus tip for anyone that uses the media page, which is down here. If we give that a click, you've got this media storage, which is actually quite handy. So you can browse to all of your different drives on your PC and then find the files that you want. But there's another quick tip here as well. Once again, if I grab any folder, let's use a different one this time. I've got this source type folder. I'm going to click and I'm going to drag it into this main area here within the media page. What it's actually going to do is just really quickly drill into that folder so you can see it's gone to my D drive, resolve media, source tape, and I've got everything within there. So rather than having to navigate through the drives manually, grab any folder, drop it in there, it'll take you directly to the right place and off you go. Simple. Whether you're important on the edit page or use the media page is entirely up to you, but there's two options for you anyway. Next up, duplicating timelines and also really quickly changing a timeline to a portrait timeline for social media. So I've created this timeline here and as you can see, it's a standard 16 by 9 timeline. Now, there's something really handy you can do. If you find your timeline within your media pool, so you can see mine here is called timeline one, we've got the different icon. If we right click at any time, we can go to duplicate timeline. This is really handy if you want to do some crazy editing, you want to customize things, do some trial and error, but no, at any point, you can just jump over to this copy and you've got everything there ready to go. Now, this is also really useful if you're trying to repurpose your content for social media, trying to switch it over to a portrait resolution, for example. So I've got my timeline one. I've now got my timeline one copy. I'm going to rename this. You can do that really quickly just by double clicking within the media pool. I'm just going to call this one portrait. Now, rather than messing with resolutions and all that sort of stuff, if you hop over to the cut page and then the top right hand corner, you've got this little icon, give that a click and you can simply change it to portrait and it will switch this current timeline, the copy we've just made really quickly to a portrait timeline. We can then hop back to the edit page and we can just edit it in portrait mode so it's ready to go. Now, you've probably noticed a problem with that and that's the fact the video isn't scaled. The video is dee-nee in the portrait window, but again, there's a quick fix for that as well. That's my next tip, scaling. Back in the edit page, if you click on any piece of footage on your timeline, open up the inspector top right hand corner, scroll down until you get to this retime and scaling and you've got scaling within here. Now, by default, it will say project settings. If we click the little drop down, we've got crop, fit, fill and stretch. If we change it to crop, what it will do is zoom all the way in and crop it so then that it fits the frame. It fits our portrait frame. We can then simply change the position left and right to get it in the exact place. It's a nice handy way of zooming things in automatically so you don't need to mess around with the zoom levels. You just need to change the position. That's obviously on a clip by clip basis and we don't want to do that. What I'm going to do, change this back to project settings. The easiest method, once again, find that timeline within your media port. I've got my portrait one here. I'm going to right click timelines, timeline settings and the timeline settings will appear here. We've got mismatched resolution at the bottom and it says scale entire image. Change that to scale full frame with crop. Click on OK. Anything that you put on this timeline will be automatically zoomed in fully like so. Then you just want to go through changing the position so that everything lines up and job done. Way easier than manually zooming everything in on your own. Next up, titles. You can save your own title presets in the vintage resolve. It's not immediately obvious, but it's also not actually that confusing to do once you get the hang of it. We're back on the edit page. I'm going to open up the effects library, top left hand corner, come down to titles and we're going to grab one of these fusion titles. Let's just go with this center reveal. We'll drop it on a timeline like so. Now we've got this simple text animation. If we give it a click in the inspector under the video title area, we've got all of the controls within here. I'm going to change this to say Mr. Alex Tech and I can change the font if I want to. It's changed it to something a bit nicer, maybe a bit bigger, change the tracking, change the color, do all the things that you'd like to do to this title and then we can save it as a preset. Open the inspector at the top. You've got this little magic wand icon. Give that a click and you'll be taken straight into fusion. Now if you're not used to fusion, don't worry. We're not going to do too much work here. We just need to do a few quick, simple things. At the bottom, you've got your node center reveal. If you give it a click, open the inspector, you'll see all of the controls within here, the same ones you've just seen so you can go and make any amendments if you need to. Once you're happy, right click on your node, go to settings and then go to save as. Now find a location on your PC. It can be literally any location on your computer that's easy to access. I'm just going to save this onto a random folder on my desktop. I've got file name. I'm going to change this. It's important that you do that. I'm just going to put Mr. Alex Tech center reveal that will do and then hit save. Then you'll be taken back into fusion. What you need to do, open up the effects library top left hand corner, expand templates, expand edit and then click on titles. You'll see all of the same titles that you used to seeing within here. Then you need to open that folder just outside of DaVinci Resolve. I've opened this up in my Windows Explorer. I'm going to grab this dot settings file and I'm just going to drag it and drop it on this big list of titles here. I can then get rid of this folder and that's it. If I go back to the edit page now, go back to my titles. In my fusion titles, I'll go to my Ms because I called it Mr. Alex Tech. You can now see we've got a Mr. Alex Tech center reveal. I can just drag that, pop it on my timeline, put my playhead over it, hit play and we've got Mr. Alex Tech. It'll pull through any of the settings which you amended before you save that dot settings file. Simple way of creating as many little title presets as you like. What if you don't like any of the default titles and transitions and effects in DaVinci Resolve 18? Well, that's where motion VFX come in. If I open up my effects library, expand titles, I've got a motion VFX folder and if I expand that, I've got a bunch of really awesome templates within here. Each of these are really simple to use. I can open the folder, grab whatever I want, drag it onto my timeline, give it a click, customize all of the content within the inspector and it's good to go. If you go back and look at basically any of my videos over the past 12 months, you're bound to see a transition effect or title that's from motion VFX because I use them all the time and they're a massive time saver. You've got a whole selection. They've got awesome title packs like the M title real style pack which contains 65 individual versatile presets. The M tuber three pack which is perfect for any of you YouTubers out there which contains 72 time saving visual tools like completely customizable calls to action, corner screens, intros, titles and social media icons. Fully tracked callouts in a recently released M callouts simple two pack. Everything is automatically installed and updated thanks to that M installer tool as well which just saves you even more time. So if you fancy checking them out for yourself, there's a link down in the description below and you can use the code Mr. Alex Tech 15 to get 15% off everything in store. Winner. Next up, power bins. Power bins are folders which are shared amongst all of your projects. Any future projects you create and any old ones you go back into, if you've got a power bin set up, you can share stuff between them. To turn them on, simply go to view. Come on all the way down until you see show power bins and then give that a click and then within your media pool you'll see power bins and by default you'll just have a master folder. Now within here you can drop all sorts of things. I can grab this title we've just created, pop that in there and now I've got this sensory reel that's ready to drop out from any future project. You can put videos, photos, all sorts of stuff within here. Now the thing to remember with this, when you're putting things into power bins, we've put this video in there like so, we need to make sure that this file doesn't move from our actual PC and needs to remain in the same location. These things aren't stored within DaVinci Resolve, it's simply linking to the file on your PC. So just bear that in mind. Power bins are an awesome little time saver if there's lots of elements you use in lots and lots of projects. Really for me things like PNGs, logos, all that sort of fun stuff. Next up, adjustment clips. If you've never used adjustment clips, why not? They're awesome, you should be using them. Here's a couple of reasons why. If you open up the effects library, come on down to effects at the very, very top, you've got an adjustment clip, just give it a click, drag it onto your timeline like so. Now by default it won't actually do anything so it doesn't look like it's done much at all. But what an adjustment clip does is it affects everything underneath. So if I grab this adjustment clip and I zoom in, you can see my footage is zooming in. If I move my adjustment clip out of the way, it's going to zoom back out. That zoom will only occur wherever this adjustment clip lies. So it can be really, really useful for adjusting multiple things on your timeline at once. As long as you put an adjustment clip above it, you're good to go. Now a couple of really great examples of this, let me grab an adjustment clip and we'll put it on my timeline like so. If we give it a click in the inspector, all we're going to do is just zoom in a little bit like so. Now wherever this adjustment clip is, we'll have a real simple snap zoom in like so and then as soon as that adjustment clip finishes, it'll zoom back out. So you can do snap zooms really quickly and easily. If you want to duplicate this along your timeline, give it a click, hold the Alt key on your keyboard or Option if you're on Mac, keeping that held, click and drag and you can make as many duplicates as you like. Put in these snap zooms all along your timeline really quick and easy rather than having to mess around with the zoom settings every single time. Now let's move across the timeline. Another great example, let's grab an adjustment clip. New one, we'll put this on here and we'll lengthen this out. If you're trying to do some cinematic black bars, that letterbox look in a very particular part of your timeline, use an adjustment clip. So I've put this new one here in the inspector once again. This time we're going to go to cropping and all we're going to do is simply crop the top of it, crop the bottom about the same amount and now we've got these cinematic cropped letterboxing black bars. Then again, wherever this adjustment clip lies, it will put those black bars, that crop on everything underneath so you can move it around, delete it if you don't like it. It's real quick and easy. Now if you want to save these adjustment clips, you can save them so those power bins we discussed a moment ago. So give this adjustment clip a click in the inspector, far right you've got File, give that a click and then within here you've got a name. So I'm going to call this one black bars like so. Then we simply open up our power bin, drag our black bars adjustment clip within there and now it sits within their black bars and any project in the future we want it, we can just grab it, plonk it on the timeline and we've got our cinematic crop. Simple, easy, fast time saving. Easy peasy. Now at this point you're probably ready to start delivering your clips as well. Fortunately, I've got two real quick tips for the deliver page as well and my first one creating custom export presets. I'm here on the deliver page. You can start from anywhere so I could go to the H.264 or 265 master. I always use 265 so I'm going to give that a click and then I just need to change the format to whatever I need it to be. So let's say I wanted an MP4, 265 with the encoder Nvidia which is generally what I use to upload my YouTube videos, change everything else if I need to but I'm going to leave it as it is. Then we simply come up to this top little three dots right here, give that a click and we can save as a new preset. So I'm going to give this a name, 265 Nvidia and then click on OK. And now on the far left of this list I've got 265 Nvidia and at any point I give it a click. It loads through all of my custom settings, adds to the render queue and it's good to go. If you've got more than one preset you get this little drop down arrow, you give that a click, you have your multiple options within there, you just select whichever one you want, adds to the render queue and off you go. Now last but not least, did you know you could render off multiple projects in one go using your render queue? So I'm going to add this project to my render queue like so but then rather than hitting render all, we're actually just going to open up the project manager, the little house in the bottom right hand corner and open up a different project. Now I've got some footage from this one, I'm also going to add this to the render queue. So now I've got these two projects lined up which I want to render in one big go. At the top of the render queue you've got these three little dots, give that a click and then click on show all projects and then anything that you've got set up to render will appear within your render queue. You can either click them individually and then just render either one or two like so or if you make sure that neither of them selected or all of them are selected up to you, you'll see the option says render all, we give that a click, it will go through each one sequentially just churning them out so that you can go put the cattle on and everything will be rendered when you get back. And that's it, don't forget to check out MotionVFX using the link down below and don't forget to use the code MRALICSTECH15 for your 15% off. Thanks for watching, take it easy, I'll see you next time.
