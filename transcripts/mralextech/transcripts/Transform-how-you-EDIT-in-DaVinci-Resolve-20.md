I see you clicking on each individual clip to grab the bit you want and then going to the next one and adding the bit you want and then going to the next one. But did you know there's a better way? It's called the Source Tape and thanks to the new DaVinci Resolve 20 update which is still in beta by the way you'll need to download it for yourself on the Blackmagic Support website which I've linked down below but thanks to that update the Source Tape is now available on the edit page. This is something I've wanted for quite some time because I love the Source Tape. I think it's one of the best ways to cut things together within DaVinci Resolve and previously it was only available on the cut page. Now it's on the edit page which is where I like to spend most of my time so it's good news indeed. It's actually better than it's ever been because it also now works with power bins and smart bins and yes it's available for those on either the studio version or the free version. So let's open up DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you how to use it and it is dead simple. So we've got an empty timeline here and I've got a media pool full of clips over here on the left. Now above your preview window you've got these three little icons this one in the middle is new and it's called Source Tape. If we give that a click what it'll simply do is grab all of the clips from your currently selected bin so I've got loads in here and it'll put them all on this big temporary timeline here so we can scrub through and review them all really quickly. Now you'll notice as I put my playhead here between this section on the left it will highlight that clip within the media pool. These white lines represent the sections between individual clips so if I move over to this next one it will jump to the next clip over to this next one here it will jump over to this clip so the correct clip will be highlighted within your media pool. Now the order of the Source Tape is linked to the order of the bin so if I click on this sort icon here it's currently sorted by clip name let's change this to timecode just for example sake and now the Source Tape has also changed so whatever order the bin is in is going to be the order the Source Tape's in. Then if you want to start actually selecting clips and putting them on your timeline you can simply use your i and o keys to mark ins and out and then click and drag to drop them straight onto your timeline like so or you can use your keyboard shortcuts like f12 to insert and all that sort of thing. You can also select sections over multiple clips at once so if I mark an in there and an out all the way over there I can then click and drag to add all of those individual sections. If we only want to add the video let's do a new in and out as we hover over our preview window we get these little icons I can click on the video one drag that down to just add the video and then let's just do a second section this time we'll use the audio waveform icon bring this down and then we'll just get the audio hopefully straight away you can see how useful that is you're no longer clicking the individual clips you can do it all in one big go it's super handy I really really like it but there are a couple of handy little things which can make your life even easier and the first one being organize your footage into bins so if I just right click within this master area here and go to new bin I'm going to create one called drone for example and we'll move these clips into my drone bin and let's just do another one called alay put those in alay like so because the source tape looks at your currently selected bin you can make your life easier by organizing everything into bins so now with the source tape open if I go to drone we're just going to get the two clips that are in this drone bin if I go to my alay bin we're just going to get the however many clips there are from this bin so it just makes life easier and you can see things in a bit more detail but at any time we can select both of those folders and then we get a source tape which contains both the alay clips and the drone clips and the next one keyboard shortcuts well keyboard shortcut really there is a keyboard shortcut which can make your life even easier and that is the Q key on your keyboard the variation of this is shift and Q so it's dead easy to remember Q shift and Q let me show you what they do so I've got my source tape open here for this alay bin and if I hit Q on my keyboard I can really quickly just jump back to the timeline so then I can scrub through this timeline I've got the preview window so I can see exactly what I'm doing make any edit any amendments do all that sort of good stuff and then when I want to add more clips to my timeline I simply hit Q once again and I'll jump directly back into this source tape so then I can start to mark some new sections and break them down onto my timeline we'll do another one bring it down I can then simply click within the timeline and it will jump back to the timeline preview and then if I hit Q once again we're back within our source tape now shift and Q allows you to drill into these individual clips so at the moment let's say I want to do an in and out for this section here but maybe it's a little bit small within my preview window if we just make sure that our source tape playhead is on this clip and then we hit shift and Q we can jump into this individual clips now I've got it full length on my preview window I can then do an in and an out bring it down onto my timeline like so that'll jump straight back to my timeline view if I hit Q I'm back in that individual clip but if I want to get back to my source tape I hit shift and Q once again and we're back in the source tape now we can go Q for timeline Q for source tape this individual clip here we'll do a shift and Q and now we're in this individual clip shift and Q again back on the source tape Q again back on the timeline now in the intro I also mentioned that they have improved the source tape because it now works with both power bins and smart bins which I don't think it did before so I've got my power bins open here and I've set up a demo it doesn't make the most sense but I've got a demo folder and within here there's a bunch of different clips so with this power bin open so power bins are folders with clips that are shared amongst all of your projects we can hit Q and we're now in a power bin source tape so I can just go through select any sections from these clips within my power bin drop them straight onto my project job done that's really really handy and then smart bins are even handier so smart bins allow you to create kind of custom filtered folders so these will automatically sort your footage into different frame rates or different resolutions or whatever without you having to do it manually I've actually made videos about the smart bins in the past might need an update actually so that might come soon as well but I'll link my old videos down below for you so I've already got a smart bin set up I've got one for anamorphic because I like to shoot anamorphic and this will automatically filter all of my anamorphic shots so rather than me having to create my own bin I can simply go to anamorphic and this will only show me the clips which are anamorphic so there we go and now with that open I can simply go to my source tape and now we've got a source tape just for my anamorphic shots within this project without me having to create an additional bin you could have one for 120 frames 60 frames 30 different frame rates or once with audio once without audio and all that sort of stuff you could even set one up for sub clips which is another handy little trick again I've made a video all about sub clips so if you don't know what I'm talking about I'll link that down below as well so that is the new source tape on the edit page within DaVinci Resolve I think that's pretty much everything you need to know to get started if you found this useful do give me a like comment subscribe all that other YouTube nonsense thanks for watching take easy I'll see you next time
