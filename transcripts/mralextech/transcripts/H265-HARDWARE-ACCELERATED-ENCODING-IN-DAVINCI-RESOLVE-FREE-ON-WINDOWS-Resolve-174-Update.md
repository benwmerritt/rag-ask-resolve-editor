Four times faster. Four times faster. Hardware acceleration is now included in the free, yes, the free version of DaVinci Resolve on Windows. They've finally done it. They've added hardware acceleration to the free version of DaVinci Resolve on Windows. People have wanted this for absolutely ages. It's been available on the Mac version, the free version on Mac for a while. It's always strange that it wasn't available on the Windows version, but now it is. Now it's here. You can export your videos in H.265, which means you get much, much faster exports and considerably smaller file sizes so they're easier to upload to YouTube as well. It's amazing stuff. And weirdly, it's hidden away. It's not a headline feature of this latest DaVinci Resolve 17.4 update, which was released today. You can go ahead and download it. All the headline features are talking about the new Apple stuff, which I get. That's really exciting and I can't wait to get my hands on one of those in the future, but they've snuck it in. Hardware accelerated H.265 encodes on the free version on Windows. So if you don't know what I'm talking about, basically in the previous version, you could only export H.264, which means that all of the work was being done by your process. Your graphics card was just sitting there dormant, not really doing anything. Now that you can do H.265 video accelerated encoding, you can export your videos using the GPU, which is just considerably faster. How much faster? Well, it will depend on the type of video formats you're using, but I've run a few tests. I've actually downgraded, I've uninstalled my studio version and put the free version on just for you guys so I could do this demonstration. And this project, so the first half of this, the first four minutes, this is 4K 8-bit footage from my A7R2, I think it was at the time, or A7 III, one or the other. And then the rest of this is 6K black magic raw. You can see this is the free version. It just says DaVinci Resolve rather than DaVinci Resolve Studio. Now I'm gonna hop into the Deliver tab. I originally installed 17.3, the free version, and I exported in 264, and this project took 12 minutes and 36 seconds. On this latest version, it took three minutes and 42 seconds. That's four times faster, four times faster. Now I'm using an RTX 2060. I don't know whether this is limited to Nvidia or you'll be able to do the same on AMD as well. I'm not too sure, unfortunately, I haven't had enough time to test any of that stuff. So if you're using an AMD card, give it a go and let me know down in the comments section below. So how do you do it? Really simply, you come over to the Deliver tab, set your format to be MP4, and then you've got codec. Give that a click. Previously, the only option was H.264. You can now go to H.265, and then you add to Render Queue and off you go. It will use your GPU, your graphics card, rather than your process to export the video and you'll get smaller file sizes and much, much faster exports. I originally was gonna talk you through some of the other cool stuff that I've implemented in 17.4, of which there is a fair bit. There's some other really cool stuff, but then I found this and figured, now this is worth talking about on its own. If you don't wanna know what else is available in the new release, stick around because I'll be making another video over the weekend showing you some of that cool stuff. If you don't wanna wait, jump over to the Blackmagic channel. I've linked it down below, and they've done a what's new video showing some of the other fun stuff. Weirdly in that video, they don't actually show you this or even talk about this. So it's very strange, and it's also hidden away in the release notes. You really do have to go digging around for it to find out that this is even a feature in the new release. But it's there, trust me, this is the free version and it makes a significant difference. There it is, that's all I wanted to show you because it's amazing news, it's finally here. Please give it a go, let me know your findings down in the comments section below. Let me know how much of a difference you see, but let's just enjoy this Friday celebration because we now have hardware acceleration on the free version of DaVinci Resolve. Mega, mega.
