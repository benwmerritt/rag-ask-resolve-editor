Why am I asking you to un-press that bell button? Well I'm not actually, not all of you, but I know that the vast majority of my subscribers are here purely for my tutorials. They are my most popular videos, they get the most views, they get the most watch time, they get me the most subscribers, I know that's why a lot of you are here. So if you're here purely for the tutorials, feel free to un-hit that bell button. You know that I'll upload a tutorial on a Friday, there may be some others here and there, but generally speaking if you check out the weekend there'll be a new tutorial for you to watch. But if you're interested in these vlogs and any of the other techy videos that I do, do hit that bell button. Make sure that you're notified because I'm not seeing it to a schedule or just be uploading these whenever I make them. And on the subject of subscribers, I've just hit 5,000. 5,000! So thank you all very very much. It's amazing. I never thought I'd reach a thousand. Once I hit a thousand I'll say oh this is cool, we're going to see what we can do. I never thought I'd hit 5,000 so that's amazing. At the moment I'm gaining about a thousand new subscribers. At the moment I'm gaining about a thousand new subscribers each month, which is just... Now, I've also got some other thanks that I wish to extend, but I haven't got time now because I need to go to work. So off to work, we go. That's it, we're done. Another day, another dollar all finished at work and we're back in the car. I was talking about who I want to thank. Now there's two people initially I want to thank. There's one more I'm going to thank later because I think there's more information at home. A while ago someone told me to set up something called BuyMeAcoffee.com. BuyMeAcoffee.com is simply a website where you can go and donate to someone. You can choose to donate one, two or three cups of coffee, so $3, $6 or $9. I was a bit hesitant because I don't really like to ask for money, but I decided to do it. I put it in my description a few weeks ago, didn't mention it because I didn't want to make a song or dance about it. I didn't think anyone would see it, but I thought I'd put it there, it's there, we'll leave it be. Last weekend I had two donations, so two people bought me a cup of coffee. So I just wanted to say thank you very, very much for that. Really, really appreciate it. It made my day actually to see that coming through. You've felt my videos and you've felt the work that I do on this YouTube was worthwhile. It was worth donating a few quid or few dollars for me to grab a coffee. So I really do appreciate it. Chris and Anonymous, whoever you are, thank you very, very much. I earn a living, do my own thing. YouTube started to bring in a few pennies now, thanks to the advertising, so please do not feel obliged to donate anything. But I am sincerely thankful for those that did and anyone that decides they want to in the future. Now I've got to drive home because I've got all the usual rubbish to do. So off we go. No montage this time because I did a driving home montage last time, so we're just going to be home right about now. And we're back home. This cover the address is, this is a parcel I've received all the way from America. And that leads me on nicely to the next person I need to thank. It's a man by the name of Carl Kinn. I'm going to pop a link to his channel in the description below. Carl if you're watching also, make sure you comment below so I can pin your comment. Last week in my other vlog I said this. There is a 3.5mm adapter for the Osmo pocket but it's impossible to get hold of at the moment in the UK. Carl actually contacted me after watching my last vlog and said, hey, I have one. I'm not using it because I don't use my Osmo pocket much these days. Would you like it? I of course said, yeah, actually that would be great. So I want to sincerely thank Carl Kinn. I haven't opened this yet. I'm going to open it in a second. How funny would that be if it was empty? If he's just taken the pill along and said, I'm sure he hasn't. I will open it in a second. But yeah, I joined this time to sincerely thank Carl Kinn. Really means a lot knowing that people appreciate this stuff enough to do this. It really means a lot. So thank you very much. Now I can open it. There it is. Thank you Carl. Thank you very, very much. And because I was expecting that, I've gone out and bought this Movo VXR10 universal car void microphone. Basically very similar to the Rode video mic. But I want to take a comparison and this one seems to have a little bit more low down, a little bit basier. So I like the idea of this. Plus it was a little bit cheaper. So everything you've heard so far, as I said before, is recorded on the R2Met bucket with the default microphone. In a second, you're going to hear this microphone. So we'll see how it sounds. And this is with the microphone. And as hopefully you can tell, it's much better than the built microphone. Way, way better. Even in here, there's a noticeable difference in my opinion. And then when you go outside, there's an even greater difference. Because obviously with the dead cat with the windmuff on it, it'll prevent all that wind noise. So it should sound a hell of a lot better. It means I can actually use it outside, which is slightly terrifying because then that means I have one less excuse to actually do vlogs out in public. So yay, I think. Now also, as you may have noticed, this is a different T-shirt. This is a different day. Most of that vlog was filmed on Thursday. It's now Sunday. And there's a reason for that. It just felt like a bit of a failure, to be honest. I wasn't happy with the vlog at all. So I decided on the day to just put it in the corner, bin it, leave it, not finish this vlog. Then I had a bit of an epiphany today and I realized that doing that is unfair, basically. It's unfair on you guys that have committed to watch these vlogs and it goes against the principle of these vlogs. I'm learning to vlog, which means I need to accept that I'm going to fail sometimes and I need to put them out anyway. So that's what this is. This is me putting this vlog out, even though I'm not entirely happy with it, because I want you guys to see it. And then A, you can give me some feedback. Let me know if you think it's a bit rubbish or if you think it's okay. And also, how's me accountable for it? And I think further down the line, I'll appreciate it. If I get good at vlogs and this YouTube continues to grow as it's doing, which hopefully it does, then I might be able to look at these and go, Oh, I've come a long way. I've really improved. So I think it's good, even though you're not happy, even though you think I just want to bin that, I want to ignore it and pretend it never happened. Edit it as best you can, put it out anyway, because you'll learn from it and you'll get better. And that's what this project is all about. So here it is in all its glory. Oh, one last thing. One thing I'm going to mention. One thing. Hopefully this looks all right. Got a bit of light. I've got some lights going on. I've set up some lights in here. I've got my camera. I've got a new external monitor, which means I'll be more consistent with the framing and the lighting for my DaVinci Resolve video. So hang on, I'll give you guys a tour. This is a bodge. This is not how you should do things. I'm not using proper lights. I've got, well, let me just show you. It is my camera. This is my A6500, my good camera, good for video. And I have that now, an external monitor. So I can actually see what I'm doing. Usually, up until now, I've recorded all my videos without seeing my face. So that'll be really handy to be able to actually see what I'm doing. And then for lighting, I've got this giant umbrella here. Let's move back a bit. Big umbrella. I've lost the diffuser for it. No idea where that's gone. So we're just doing that. The light is a big LED light stick, which I actually use for my photography for light painting and stuff. But it sort of works. And then over here, we've got another one, which is just light on the other side of my face. Anyway, that's enough waffle for this one. Keep your eyes peeled on the channel because I have got some hopefully exciting stuff to announce soon. So yeah, keep your eyes peeled for that. I look forward to your feedback in the comments below and I'll see you next time. Bye. Woohoo!
