So you want to learn DaVinci Resolve? Hey, well I've got some good news. Because there's never been a better time to start learning. Blackmagic Design, the guys that actually create DaVinci Resolve, have just released 20 brand new tutorial videos to help get you started in all the different areas of DaVinci Resolve 17. And each one comes with its own project files that you can actually follow along at home in DaVinci Resolve at your own pace. Everything is available right here on YouTube. Just jump over to the Blackmagic Design YouTube channel, shoot over to the Videos tab, and you can see all of the individual videos uploaded here. Now to make life a little bit easier, they've also created playlists. So if we click on the Playlist tab, you can see the individual playlists here, the four playlists, Fusion, Edit, Color, and Fairlight. Alternatively, jump over to the Blackmagic Design Training webpage, and you can see you've got all of the videos here. They give you a brief introduction, they tell you the time, and then you can actually click on the thumbnail to view the video within your browser, or alternatively, click Video, and you can actually download the video files so that you can have them stored on your device to watch them offline whenever you wish. Just next to that video button is the Project File button, so you can give that a click to download the accompanying project files as well. The vast majority of the tools and techniques shown within these training videos are available on the free version of DaVinci Resolve. There are only a handful of times when they use features which are locked to the Studio version, which means anyone can follow along, regardless of which version you're using. So what have we actually got? Well, first up, we've got the DaVinci Resolve 17 Edit Page Training. Now, if you're brand new to DaVinci Resolve, you just wanna get started, learn how to cut some stuff together, maybe create a YouTube channel, that sort of thing, this is where you want to start. DaVinci Resolve Edit, and there's two key ones you want to watch. There's the Introduction to Editing, and then the Introduction to Editing, Part Two. The first one is one hour and nine minutes, where the second is 44 minutes. Part One covers the basics to get you started importing and organizing all of your media, and then start cutting and editing together an example timeline. So it's a really good place to start. Part Two, then expands on that, shows you how to do some things like trimming, replacing shots, and even mixing audio, and then diving into some of the titles and transitions available within DaVinci Resolve as well. Now, one thing these videos don't cover is actually rendering or delivering your projects. But don't worry, there is a separate training video that covers those. Weirdly, it's within the color area, but if you shoot over to the DaVinci Resolve 17 color on the training page or the playlist, there's a separate video in there, it's a 20-minute video, and it covers delivering content. So it will show you how to customize presets, as well as just rendering projects out, setting the bitrate, names, different formats, and codecs, and all that sort of good stuff. Now, sticking with the edit page, there are actually two more videos within that playlist. First up, you've got the MultiCam editing, which allows you to sync multiple angles together, and then you've got visual effects on the edit page, which shows you how to make use of the transform tools to do some corner pinning, the 3D key tool to do some basic green screening, and then the video collage tools that you can put together some picture-in-picture style effects. And then, of course, we've got the color page. DaVinci Resolve historically was known best for its color grading abilities, so of course, there are lots of videos talking about color as well. Well, of course, we've got an introduction to color, we've then got advanced color, the DaVinci Resolve mini panel, delivering content, as mentioned before, and then color management. The Resolve mini panel is actually a separate piece of hardware used by colorists when colorading within DaVinci Resolve. If you don't have a mini panel, then of course, you can skip that video because it'd be pretty irrelevant to you. Of course, the introduction to color is the best place to start. It's got everything you need to start doing some basic color correction or even some fancy grades within DaVinci Resolve. It'll get you started with things like scopes, curves, primary wheels, nodes, and then everything in between. Next up, we've got a whole seven videos talking about the DaVinci Resolve 17 Fairlight page. Now, for those that don't know, Fairlight is DaVinci Resolve's in-built audio mixing page. So if you need to do any sort of audio work, you'll generally hop into the Fairlight page to do it. Here, we've got introduction to audio, introduction to sound design, introduction to mixing, recording, VO and ADR, which is voiceover and automated dialogue replacement, working with audio track layers, channel mapping and linked groups, and then lastly, Dolby Atmos integration. Now, some of those are a little bit more niche. If you're just doing YouTube videos or home videos, the Dolby Atmos, for example, won't be that relevant to you, but certainly get stuck into things like the introduction to audio and then the introduction to sound design as well, so that you can start learning your way around the Fairlight page. Now, last but not least, of course, we've got DaVinci Resolve 17 Fusion. Now, again, for those that don't know, Fusion is DaVinci Resolve's built-in visual effects and motion graphics engine or page. That's where you go to do any sort of visual effects work. It's all done on the Fusion page. And in this area, we have four. And for this one, there are four separate videos. There's introduction to Fusion, basic compositing, motion graphics in Fusion, and then 3D compositing in Fusion. Again, this will depend on how much you want to get stuck into the motion graphics side of things. Of course, start with the introduction to Fusion and learn your way around. Fusion is a slightly odd bit of kit to get used to because it's all node-based, but once you get going with it, honestly, it's not too bad. Of course, that then goes into basic compositing and then learning to create some cool motion graphics in there as well. There's a total of about four hours of Fusion training in there, so there's loads of cool stuff to get your teeth into. So definitely give that a look if that side of DaVinci Resolve is of interest to you. Now, of course, don't forget on this same page on the DaVinci Resolve website, there's also a load of books which you can download for free. You can grab the PDFs again directly from here, or if you'd prefer you can buy physical copies over on Amazon. So now there is no excuse not to learn DaVinci Resolve. It's a free piece of software. You can go and download right now, and there's a whole bunch of free training delivered by the experts themselves, which you can get stuck into without paying a penny. Good luck on your journey into DaVinci Resolve if you are brand new to it. I hope you enjoy all these videos, and I hope to see you around on the channel talking about more DaVinci Resolve goodness in the future. Take it easy. I'll see you next time.
