Audio sync like this is only really acceptable in old school kung fu movies, which is of course, this is YouTube My name's Alex. This is Mr. Alex Tech and in this video I'm gonna get you started and give you some quick tips and tricks when using the auto audio sync feature in the edit page of DaVinci Resolve. Now make sure you stick around to the end because my last tip, it's a keyboard shortcut, is an absolute killer one that everyone needs to know. Right, no more messing around Let's open up DaVinci Resolve and take a look. So here we are in DaVinci Resolve We're on the edit page and I've already imported some footage now I'm gonna grab this clip here. Just put on my timeline and We're gonna hit play And as you can see it's got audio but it sounds a little bit rubbish and that's because this was recorded on my camera This is the in camera audio and I've got this audio up here untitled.wav This was recorded externally and this is my much higher quality audio I want to sync So how do we do that first of all? Well, all you need to do is highlight them both within the media pool Right-click and then come down to auto sync audio and then you've got four options Timecode, timecode and append, waveform, waveform and append. Now Timecode will only work if you started recording your audio and your video at precisely the same time or if you use some sort of Timecode sync hardware that sort of thing. Most people would better off just using the waveform Waveform will look at the audio within the video clip and the separate audio file match up the waveforms and then you're good to go So in this video generally we're going to be talking about the waveform option. So sticking with waveform We've got two options waveform, waveform and append tracks So let me just show you what they do if I click on waveform It'll have a little thing and then it'll look like nothing's happened But if I grab that same video file out of my media pool drop it onto my timeline You can now see that the waveform looks a bit different and it's actually just synced it up So now we're using this waveform instead if we hit play You can hear it's much better quality audio now what happens if we appended this is what happens if you use based on Waveform and append instead. I'm going to give that a click It'll do the same thing It'll have a thing and then I'll grab the clip from my media pool drop it on my timeline and now you can see we've actually got two Audio tracks so we've got the original audio at the top here on audio track one And then we've got the newly synced audio down here on audio track number two So this is a nice way of just checking to make sure that it's actually lined up So as you can see what it's done It's used a little waveform to match everything up and hopefully everything's in sync if we hit play It sounds pretty good now if we want to delete this original audio track a quick way to do that hold alt on your keyboard Give it a click and then just use the backspace key To remove that like so if we then just want to move this audio onto track number one hold alt click release alt Drag it up and then you good to go everything's still linked so we can move them around treat them as one thing But now we've got the better audio attached easy-beasy But what if you've got loads of clips loads of audio files you want to do together where you can you can do it in one Single action, so let me show you that so within my media pool here You can say I've got a folder called go pro I'm going to open that and then within here I've got lots of video with audio and then accidentally record audio as well Now there's a few ways that you can do this now the first option We can highlight everything within that or all the things that we want to sync together like so Right-click we've got the auto sync audio option and then we've got our same four options as before or If you right-click anywhere within an empty space simply go to the bottom Auto sync audio and then click based on waveform or alternatively if we just jump into my master bin I've got go pro here if I right-click on the bin itself Auto sync audio we have the same options so you can auto sync the audio all the audio and all the video within a bin really quickly So I'm just going to click on based on waveform It's going to have a thing it's going to analyze all the content and then if we jump into there All of these audios have been synced with the correct video How cool is that super quick super easy to sync loads of different bits of audio with loads of different videos put it in the bin Right-click sync it all happy days But what if you need to unsync or you're not too sure if it actually has done anything? It's all in the properties. So we're going to shoot into the media pool I'm going to right-click on this clip which I've already synced the audio with we're going to come on down to the clip attributes And then from the little menu at the top make sure you're on the audio tab and then down here We can see that we've got a single mono track and the source channel is set to linked channel This tells us that this video has been linked to some separate audio to change it back to the original channel We simply click on the little drop down and we go to the embedded channel number one if it was a Stereo track it looks something like this I'm going to change the format to stereo and then we've got embedded channel one and then embedded channel two We just click on okay, and then if I was to drag this over we're back to our original audio now if you chose to sync and Depend let's have a look at that. We're going to right-click We're going to go to the clip attributes same as before we go to the audio tab It's actually slightly clearer in here. You can see that we've got multiple Audio tracks. We've got one which is stereo That was the original one with our embedded channel one and our embedded channel two and then we've got this mono track Which is our linked channel if you want to get rid of that linked channel just hover over the line over on the right hand side There's a little bin icon. We can just give that a click to get rid of it and then click on okay easy peasy So that's how you do syncing unsyncing it messing around with all that stuff within the media pool But you can also sync on the timeline so we're going to grab this footage again Pop it on that timeline this hasn't got the the sync happen This is all the original audio then we're going to grab this audio drop it on and let's just move it around Mix it up a little bit if we just highlight them both so we're just going to click and drag highlight all of these Right-click then you've got an option right here auto align clips and again We've got the two options based on timecode or waveform. We're going to go to waveform It's going to do its best to align these clips. So let's zoom in have a look seems to have done a pretty good job Well, it's a line our good audio with our original audio and again What we can then do if we wanted to hold alt click on this one backspace to get rid of it Hold alt click release all and then what we want to do is drag this up without it moving So if you hold shift drag up doesn't matter what you do with my mouse It would just go up and down without changing position and then we can hit play Well, folks Alex here that was a cool little transition and perfect if you want to link these so they act as one thing highlight them both Right-click and then just go to link clips and then it moves around like it's a single clip We can cut we could just mess with it like it's an original But what if it didn't actually align that audio very well? Well, there's a few ways that you can actually just amend it manually to make sure that it's perfect And there's one super useful trick and that's called sub frame scrubbing which is my killer tip So let's get into that So let's pretend we've just done our sink and append or we've done it directly on the timeline and we've ended up with something like this It can happen it's something goes wrong in DaVinci Resolve and it just doesn't quite align it So let's try and align it manually Now there's a few ways that you can do this if we click on this untitled WAV here And then we can just use the comma and the full stop keys to shift this Forward and backwards on the timeline. So I'm just going to move this over and try and get this in the right place Something like that if we zoom right in it looks pretty good, but actually This if I move that I want that a little bit there to line up with this bit here It's too far backwards here, and it's too far forwards here. So what do we do? How do we get this audio perfect? Well, this is where our sub frame scrubbing comes in This allows you to move the audio less than one frame So you can do teeny tiny little adjustments, which is super handy The keyboard shortcut is hold alt and then use the left and right arrow keys Now a quick note for this we're scrubbing through the audio So let me just move right over here if I do lots of these you can see the audio is moving Within the track, but the actual track is staying in the same location. But then what we can do. Let's find another point Let's go right There we're gonna hold alt we're gonna keep tapping right Till we've got this looking exactly as I want it and we can hit play And that sounds absolutely spot-on so just remember you can move forwards and backwards using the full stop and comma But then sub frame scrubbing you hold alt and use the left and right arrow keys And there you go some quick tricks for getting started with the auto audio sync in DaVinci Resolve Hopefully enjoyed it thumbs up if you did subscribe if you knew here. Thanks for watching. I'll catch you next time See ya
