Transitions! Who doesn't love them? DaVinci Resolve has loads of them and they can be used to jazz up your videos, animate photos, logos and even titles without messing about with keyframes and they're dead easy to use. But there are a few quick tips and tricks which you need to know to make sure you're making the most of them. But first we need to transition into this video's sponsor Nvidia Studio and scan computers. Nvidia Studio is an initiative to use the RTX GPU to accelerate creative applications and design laptops and desktop systems that are perfect for creative professionals like us. Applications like DaVinci Resolve use RTX GPU acceleration to improve timeline performance meaning effortless edits, faster exports using NVNC encoding and the Nvidia Tensor cores allow you to use the awesome DaVinci Resolve Studio effects like speedwarp, face refinement and magic masks effortlessly. And scan computers are one of the biggest and most trusted Nvidia Studio resellers in Europe. So click the link below to check out their line of Nvidia Studio certified laptops from the likes of Gigabyte, Acer and Razer plus their own line of award-winning 3XS Nvidia Studio approved custom systems built specifically for creators. One of which I'm using right now but more about my own system at the end of this video. So first transition tip, change their default length. In DaVinci Resolve click on the words DaVinci Resolve top left hand and then go to preferences. When the little window pops up click on user at the top and then from the menu on the left go to editing. Down here in the general settings you've got standard transition duration. You can select between seconds and frames and then you just enter the number in there. If you want every transition to be a default of 1.1 seconds put 1.1 in there and job done. Easy peasy. Tip number two changing the transition length on the timeline. So you will probably know that you can click on the transition and drag to make it longer or shorter. But what you may not know if you right click and you can go to change transition duration or you can use the keyboard shortcut of control D to change it that way. Or as a third option give the transition a click on the timeline so it's highlighted in red. In the inspector top right hand corner go to the transition tab and from here you've got duration. Click and hold your mouse on the actual number and you can just slide it to the right or to the left same on the frames to increase or decrease the length of this transition getting it exactly as you want it. Perfect next one shift it. We've all done it. We've all grabbed the transition. We've gone to put it on this edit point here and we've accidentally put it over to the left or the right like so. You don't need to delete it and do it again if you simply right click the transition you've got these options. Start on edit or put it on the right hand side. End on edit or put it on the left hand side and then of course you've got center on edit. Alternatively give that transition a click in the inspector once again. You've got this alignment area. You can just use the little icons to pop it from the left center and the right. Quick and easy but what if it won't shift? There's a common error you probably see in DaVinci Resolve with transitions and that's regarding handles. Let me show you how to fix that. If you've ever gone to grab a transition put it on this edit point and it won't let you put it on either the left or the center. It'll only go on the right hand side or the left depending on which way you're working. That's because this video doesn't have any handles so let me show you what that means. This is the very start of this video. You see I can't drag it any further left. There's no additional footage past this point and DaVinci Resolve needs this. It needs a little bit of an overlap in order to create the transition. Instead what I'm going to do put that back in its place. I'm going to grab the trim tool by clicking on this icon or I could just hit T on my keyboard. I'm going to trim this just the left a little bit and you can see we've got the little white box. That just means that we now have an overlap between these two clips so if I now grab a transition I can put it onto the left, onto the right or in the center as I need it. Right my next tip they're not just for videos. You can use them for videos, photos, PNGs, even titles. So here I've got this logo. I've got my DaVinci Resolve logo and I want to animate it to fly in but I don't want to mess around with keyframes. So instead from the video transitions just scroll down until you get to the motion area and the best one to use for this is the one called push. Give it a click and drag it and put it onto your logo like so and then if I hit play it's simply going to slide in from the left by default. If we give the transition a click in the inspector we've got these options within the transitions area and we've got this preset. We've got push left, push right, push up and push down. Underneath the logo I've got a title text which just says DaVinci Resolve and I want the same thing to happen. So I'm going to grab push I'm going to pop it on there whoops I've put it in the wrong place so I'm just going to shift it over to the sensor using our alignment and now we've got both of these animated in from the left hand side easy peasy. So there you go it works but the motion is a little bit boring we need to change that up and we can do that with my next tip and that's easy. So I'm just going to delete this DaVinci Resolve one for now and we'll just go back to this logo. As you can see it flies in but it's looking a little bit dull and that's because it has no acceleration. I'm just going to zoom into my timeline a little bit. You can see on the transition we've got this faded sort of line that represents the acceleration of the transition. If I give it a click in the inspector come on down to ease and it's currently set to none. If I change that to in you can see this little line changes and what in means is it will start off slow and then speed up at the end giving us this. If we change it to out that will reverse it so it will start off fast and then slow down and if we change it to in and out it will give us that s curve which means it'll be slow at the beginning fast in the middle slow at the end giving us a real nice little animation. Unfortunately there isn't a way to save that as the default. You do always have to remember to go transition in and out job done but what if you want to copy that transition to other edit points where you can do that really quickly and easily with my next tip and that's copying transitions. So we've got our push and I want to copy it to all different edit points of here. So we've got a nice looking animation. All we're going to do give it a click on your timeline hold down the alt key or option if you're on a Mac keeping that held click once again and then we can just drag this transition to the end and it'll copy it exactly as it was keeping it in and out animation. We're then going to do the same thing here give it a click hold the alt key give it a click again and hold drag down it's gone in the wrong place I'm just going to shift it over using my alignment job done we've animated those exactly the same time with the same transition. Boom for my next tip we're going to use a solid color to create a solid color transition. In DaVinci Resolve go to the effects library generators grab a solid color and put that across your edit point like so. I want to make this solid color about a second or two in length so I'm just going to go with that and we want it dead in the middle of this edit point. I'm going to give the solid color a click in the inspector generator color change this to something that looks a little bit nicer I'm going to go with an orange then I'm going to grab a transition anyone will do I'm going to go with this triangle left and pop it on this edit point like so I'm going to shift this over using my alignment I'm going to change my easing to in and out now I'm going to replicate this transition towards the end so they meet in the middle and now we've got this nice looking solid color animation. I've actually made a whole video about using these solid colors to create real simple but awesome effects in DaVinci Resolve so make sure to check that one out as well. Don't forget to scroll down the list because there's some gems hidden further down in the fusion transitions area. Most people forget that if you keep scrolling down you'll get to the fusion transitions and we've got things like circles, camera shake, brightness flash, drop warp, film strip, there's loads of cool transitions within here. If you keep going down even further you've got this Resolve FX transitions area and there's a really great one in here called burn away. I'm going to drop that on my solid color lengthen this out a little bit and as you can see we've got this really cool burn style transition. For my next tip we're going to use some different transitions and we're going to start to customize them just that little bit more. So I've got my solid color and my logo once again I'm going to go and grab a transition which I might not ordinarily use so I've got this hexagon. We'll pop that on there, we're going to center it and we'll lengthen it out a little bit. We'll give it a click in the inspector if in doubt in and out we're going to change that to in and out and now we've got this transition but if we want to customize it a little bit more there's loads of options within here so we can change the preset, we can use an offset to move it around, we can change an aspect ratio, other rotation and even add a border. If we add a border it will default to white, we can change the color of that using this little color picker here or alternatively if we click the feather we now have this feathered effect instead. So I'm going to turn off feather, I'm going to change the color let's just go with a nice little gray and now we've got this transition instead which actually looks kind of cool. I'm going to turn my logo back on, we'll copy this across same as before and now I've got this real nice transition. Now if you want to get really fancy you can start to animate those controls. So I've got this transition, I've got my in and out but I want to add a bit of a spin to it. So if I give it a click inspector I've got my rotation and I can change the rotation but what I'm going to do I'm going to put my playhead at the very beginning of the hexagon and then I'm going to go to my rotation I'm just going to click on this at a like on here to add a keyframe and then going to move my playhead to the end and I want it to spin around 180 degrees I'm going to put 180 in the rotation and then hit enter. That's going to tell DaVinci Resolve that I want it to be zero degrees at the start 180 at the end giving us this nice little spin just adding a little extra something to that transition. If you're not happy with the way it spins or the easing you can start to mess around and do some custom curves with the animation as well. On the transition on the timeline you've got this little diamond icon give that a click and then you'll get this box of pear underneath in the top right hand corner you've got this little s curve give that a click as well and then you can actually see the curves for the keyframes that we've added you may need to zoom in a little bit like so and then I've got this little drop down so I'm going to turn off the rotation for now just so we've got this transition curve and this shows us the curve of our animation so if I give it a click we can actually click on the handles at the ends and we can lengthen those out we can play with it to get it looking exactly as we want it so if I want it to be a little bit faster in the middle I'll do something like that and now we've got an even faster animation if I hold down my alt key and then click on the line I could add additional handles so I can get really crazy and do some cool custom curves if I use that drop down once again I'm going to go back to my rotation because we turn this on at the minute it's just linear so I'm going to click on my start handle and then change it using these icons at the top if you click on this middle one here it will just figure out which type of curve it needs to be so we're going to click on the end one same thing again click on the middle one we've now got a nice little s curve for our spin giving us a transition that looks something like this if you've customized a transition but you want to change the type without losing your customization you can do that too so I've got my hexagon here which we've just made with all of our spin if I go and grab an oval for example put it on top it's going to overwrite everything you can see we don't have the easing we don't have any of our options it's going to undo that instead if I click on my hexagon in the inspector the transition type at the top I can use the drop down let's change this to an irish instead and now it's an iris but we've still got our border and we've still got our custom easing curve so now we've got something that looks like this you can just go through that list changing it to something else while keeping all of your easing until you're perfectly satisfied with your transition so now we've done all that hard work you probably want to save these transitions and you can do that by saving as a transition preset right click any transition on the timeline and then you've got this option create a transition preset give that a click and then this window will appear let's give it a name I'm going to call this 180 hex and then just click on okay I'm going to delete this from my timeline from the video transitions area within the effects library scroll down until you see this user area and now I've got a 180 hex I can give that a click drag it on like so lengthen it out do what I need to do it's got all of our easing it's got our custom rotation it's even got our border and then I hit play and it's there ready to go if you don't want to have to click and drag every time you can set a transition as your standard and then apply it using a keyboard shortcut so I'm just going to delete this one off the timeline I'm going to go to my 180 hex I'm going to right click and then I've got an option here to set as standard transition once you've clicked that you'll see this little red icon on the left hand corner what that means is if I click any edit point on my timeline like so so it's highlighted in green and then use the keyboard shortcut of control and T it will automatically apply that transition to that edit point so let's go to somewhere else let's go over to this edit point here give it a click control T and it will drop that hex again on there like so now big thanks to today's sponsor nvidia studio and scan computers all of this video was recorded and edited on my scan 3x s nvidia studio certified pc rocking the beastly nvidia rtx 3090 amd riser 95950x and 64 gigabytes of RAM which was a huge step up from my old system and absolutely true to everything I throw at it in the venture resolve all of which just means that I'm able to keep creating these videos for you guys so big thanks to nvidia studio and scan for sponsoring this video and please do check out scans full lineup of nvidia studio approved systems by clicking on the link down in the description below thanks for watching I'll catch you next time see you
