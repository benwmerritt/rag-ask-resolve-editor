If you're new to editing, or even actually if you've been editing for any amount of time, I know just how easy it is to feel just a little bit lost. Because all the software, like DaVinci Resolve, is pretty massive, so there's loads of stuff to learn. Plus, there's all kinds of technical jargon. There's things like train rates and resolution. And then of course, there's storytelling. Plus then there's the fact that there's a million different ways of doing things, but no definitively right way of doing. It's all very strange. It can all become just a little bit daunting. So here's some perspective. Just some little things to think about if you're just starting out in video editing, or all of this pretty much applies if you're trying to start a YouTube channel as well. Now really quickly, all of the effects you're seeing in this video, all of the freeze frames, titles, particles, transitions, everything, are part of the M documentary pack by MotionVFX, who just so happened to be sponsoring this video. So if you like what you see and you want to see the rest of the MotionVFX packs that are available for DaVinci Resolve, make sure to click the link down in the description below. Mahap! Number one, have fun. I've got notes because I can never remember what I meant to say during these sorts of things, but yeah, have fun. I know that sounds super cheesy. It is super cheesy, but it really is true. Video editing, creating videos, YouTube-ing, all this sort of stuff that we do, should be fun. You're creating something and that's awesome. So make sure that you're having fun when you do it. And to me, that means creating what you want, editing what you want, and doing it in the way that you want to do it, even if technically it's not correct. If you're just starting out, just get stuck in, mess around and have some fun. Don't put too much pressure on yourself because nothing kills fun like pressure. The same can be said about comparing yourself to others because as they say, comparison is the thief of joy. And it's likely that the first few videos or edits or whatever you're doing, the first ones that you make, probably going to suck. Not going to lie to you. Mine certainly did. And guess what? That's totally okay. As long as you're having fun, you're doing what you want to do, you're progressing, you're learning, you're enjoying the process. Who cares if it sucks initially? By doing, you'll get better. You're already in the on the right path group of people because you've started and you can't get better unless you start. And on a similar note, number two, start small. It can be really tempting to jump into a massive project right away, but start off small and take bite-sized chunks to get better bit by bit. You can always work your way up to something massive a little bit later on. Feel like Bear Grills. But yeah, start small. Just do manageable little bits until you get better and better. So my advice, if you need to start, if you're not too sure where to start, just make and edit something totally random. Just create something. You don't even need to post it anywhere. If it doesn't turn out how you like, just save it for another day. Archive it, never look at it again, or look at it again in six months to remind yourself how far you've come. Now, if you don't actually have any footage yourself, just grab some from somewhere like Pexels. There are some decent free stock footage websites out there where you can just download the footage and basically do what you want with it. If you're running DaVinci Resolve Studio, you can also get your hands on some Black Magic Raw. You need a bunch of studio to edit the raw, but the raw is free for everyone to download. I've put a link down below. Just download it, dump it into Resolve and start cutting it, grading it, maybe drop some titles on there. Just do little things to learn how stuff works. Have some fun, mess around, and see what you can do. And just remember, you can't break anything. I mean, you can temporarily, but you can't break anything permanently. So if it goes wrong, you can just undo it and try it again. Or if it goes completely wrong, you can bin it and try another time. And you haven't even wasted time, really, as long as you've learned what went wrong and you can apply that for next time. So it's win-win, really. And that's literally what I do. When I'm trying to learn or practicing for a new tutorial, I'll generally use stock footage. I'll dump it in Resolve. I'll just mess about with it. When I originally started making videos about DaVinci Resolve, I knew very little about DaVinci Resolve. But I gave myself homework. I learned something really small and specific, like how to use the transform tools, how to do slow motion, how to stabilize a shot. And if you do those small little things over and over and over again, in actually a surprisingly small amount of time, you realize that you've learned quite a lot. I've got absolutely no idea where I am, by the way, or where I'm going. This is just a word that I come to. I've come to it in the past. I've made videos on it, talking about it, and I just wander around. But it's actually quite big, so it's quite easy to get a little bit lost. Wow. It's fun, though. Adventure await. You do need to be consistent, though, which is my tip number three, and that's be consistent. Little and often. It's like eating. They recommend that you eat little and often. Same thing with DaVinci Resolve. Make a list of loads of small, tiny little things like how to transform, how to crop, how to stabilize, how to create a node, how to deliver, how to make a preset, whatever, all these teeny, tiny little things. And then every day, give yourself five or 10 minutes, pick one from the list, and just do it in Resolve. Even if you've done it before, just do this one little thing, and it will cement that knowledge. And as mentioned before, you do these little, tiny things over time, and you can build up this big wealth of knowledge. Which is good. I can't remember where I was going with that. Was that it? Bite size chunks, learning. Yeah, whatever. That's about right. So I have fun. Oh, I'm too bright now. So yeah, start small, have fun, practice as often as you can. Right, now for my next one, take inspiration from others, which is a really polite way of saying steal. Steal other people's techniques, steal other people's ideas. Steal my ideas. I know I did say don't compare yourself to others, and that's still the case. But if you see something you'd like, try and replicate it yourself. Just remember, you may not be able to do it as well as that other person, at least not initially. And when you steal it, try and add your own bit of flavor to it. You see, now I film this video in a different way than I usually do, because I'm trying to emulate the people that I like. There'll be a comment below saying always trying to be the new Pete McKenna or the new Casey Neistat or whatever. I'm not as good as those. I know I'm not, but I like the way they do things. So I've tried to come out of my comfort zone, come out of my studio and film this in a bit of a different way. I'm emulating them, but I'm trying to add my own little source to it and doing it in my own specific way. So why challenge you? Try and make this video. I've even put the script down below. So you can follow this entire video word for word, but I'm not word for word because I've kind of ad-libbed, but you know, mostly word for word, the script's down below. So try and make this video exactly the same as I did, if you want to. Try and replicate everything that I've done. And even if you try and do it one to one, you'll notice that it'll look a little bit different. It'll be uniquely you as an aside. If you'd like me to make a shorter version of this style video, but actually give you access to all of the video files so you can literally just edit yourself, let me know. I'd more than happily do that. I'd have to figure out how to host it. I might have to charge people because it could get very, very expensive because these files are massive. But yeah, anyway, let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. And yes, I'm totally aware by the way that I'm doing lots of unnecessary shots, the walking buys, all that sort of stuff. But like my point number one, I don't care. I'm here to have fun and I'm having fun with it. So why not? Which leads me nicely onto the last quick point I wanted to make. Don't take it too seriously. Whether it's video editing or whether it's YouTubeing specifically, it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, does it? Now I know if you're trying to make a career out of either of those things, there's more pressure involved. But at the end of the day, that are not that important. If you get a bit of an edit wrong or something doesn't turn out quite how you want it, nobody gets hurt, nobody dies, you can always just try again, learn from it, try again. But don't take it too seriously. Have fun, mess around, click some buttons, see what works, see what doesn't. This video might be horrible, might be a bit annoying. But at the end of the day, I can just come back tomorrow and I can try again. And if the edit doesn't work, I can just bin the edit and I can try that again. So don't take it too seriously. I try not to take many things seriously. I mean, I'm working a made-up job, I'm a full-time YouTuber at the moment. So, you know, I'm trying to take everything one day at a time. But yeah, have fun with it. Don't take things all that seriously. Nearly dropped my phone. And you're never wasting time if you are just messing and doing silly things. Story is the most important thing. Story will keep people engaged for the longest. Story is sort of the end game. But telling a good story is way, way easier when you don't have to think about the software. So put in the time to just mess around and learn the software by doing silly, nonsensical stuff, kind of like this video. Because then when you need to tell a story, you already know the tools well enough to tell that story without really having to think too much about it. Knowing the software makes doing the rest way easier. Obviously, we're going to go getting that thing. Hopefully you enjoyed this video. Let me know down below. Take it easy. Maybe. Just maybe. I'll see you next time. Now, I've got to try and get out of here.
