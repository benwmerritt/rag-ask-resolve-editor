What up folks Alex here now no introduction for this video because it's just a real quick one There's a bug in DaVinci resolve I want to show you the bug and then show you the workaround as well Some of you guys have actually already spotted it within the comments section Now I can't take credit for this workaround It was a chap by the name of John Holt that told me the workaround he runs this website called resolve assets If you fancy having a look he's done some quite good little articles He's got a little store on there So definitely worth having a look the link is in the description I don't know whether he actually discovered this workaround or found it of someone else But either way he's the one that told me about it So I'm just going to demonstrate the bug first of all if you're fully aware of it already Feel free to skip to the timestamp shown on screen now where I show the workaround Now for those not familiar with it. Let's just run through it really quickly So I've got a little clip on my timeline like so I'm going to grab an adjustment clip and put it on my timeline here Now this adjustment clip is exactly one second in length and this is a 24 frames per second timeline So that should have 24 frames in it from 0 to 24 Now if I click on the adjustment clip, I'm just going to open up fusion No, as you can see resolve know there's only 24 frames in it, but it thinks they start at frame 8,000 what's that 86,000 313 and ends on 86,000 336 which obviously is completely wrong Now what that means is if we let's just do a bit key framing on here So if we hit play on my timeline that works it zooms, but if I give that a name Drag that into my media pool or maybe a power bin for example And then I add that back on so maybe it's another project I'm trying to add some transitions or a blur effect like I showed in my most recent five-minute Friday if we hit play The key framing doesn't actually work. It's all disappeared Now if we click on The example here you can see that the key frames are still there because we've got these little arrows But if we click on it, it'll ping you all the way down the timeline because it thinks the key frame is miles down there And that stops everything from working So the work around what you want to do grab an adjustment clip put it on your timeline Now the way I like to do this give it a click Call it something like dummy or test or example make it the length that you want it So I'm going to keep this as one second I'm going to drag this into my media pool and then I'm going to delete it off my timeline Now I can drag the dummy back onto my timeline and now I can work with this one and it'll be absolutely fine So I'm going to call this Zoom in for example So now we've got this zoom in on the timeline. Let's just do a bit key framing We'll just do have a bit of a zoom in why not? Just zooms in like so if we put that into our Media pool I can delete it off the timeline drag it back onto the timeline and it still works That also applies if you drag the zoom in into a power bin I can drag the zoom in back onto the timeline and it's still there Now what you can do is grab dummy Put it on your timeline Rename it do whatever you want to do put that into a power bin Delete that from your timeline grab the dummy again once it's there. It's fine You just need to build from that dummy Adjustment clip rather than using a new adjustment clip every time way Now this out joe is completely unnecessary But I thought I'd film one for you guys anyway because why not even if you haven't spotted the bug yet Hopefully it does help you in the future if you decide to start building up some resources for yourself in a night handy power bin If it was useful, please do give me a thumbs up They really do help the channel if you've got any comments or feedback pop them down below and again Don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already.
