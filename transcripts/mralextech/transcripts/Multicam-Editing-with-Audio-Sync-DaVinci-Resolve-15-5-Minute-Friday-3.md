What up folks, it's Alex here and I'm back again with another 5 minute Friday. Now we all know that perspective is everything and sometimes one angle just isn't enough. On the other occasion you need not one, not two, but three angles to make sure you get that shot. Now fortunately DaVinci Resolve not only makes it really easy to synchronize those shots using the audio, but it also makes it dead easy to hop between them on your timeline. So let's hop into DaVinci Resolve and we'll have a look at how it's done. So here we are in DaVinci Resolve. Now as always the very first thing I want to do is change my timeline frame rate. It's something you should always do as you well know. Right now I'm ready to grab my media and import it into Resolve. I've got a folder all set up and here's my three clips from my three different cameras. Going to add that to the media pool as normal. Now at this point what we can do is highlight the clips, make sure they're in the media pool. You can't do it from up here, you want to add it to here and then highlight them all and then right click and you're looking to create a new multi cam clip using selected clips. You can give it a name, select the frame rate. I made sure to use the same frame rate on all three clips. You should probably do the same. If you haven't done that you just need to select the frame rate from here and then angle sync is the one you want to look at. So in and out is just when you change the in and out of the clips. Time codes it will sync by time code. The one we want though is sound because I turn the cameras on at three different times. I don't want to have to do this manually. I want it to automatically pick up on the sound within each of the clips and sync that way. So I'm just going to click on sound. Leave the rest as it is and we're going to click create. Resolve will go through all the clips, analyze the content and then link them up. It will synchronize them. Now I haven't sped that up. That's how quickly it does it on my PC. So it's quite a quick process. Now in the bin here you'll see original clips which is a folder which contains your three original clips or however many you've got and you've also got a new clip called multi-cam. So I'm going to head to the edit page and before you start the one thing to note is if you only see one preview window like this click this button up here at the top right to make sure that you see both because you'll need both when editing your multi-cam footage. Now if I click on the multi-cam in this preview window you can see the three different clips all in different squares. Now what I'm going to do is just click and drag this to my timeline and let go. Now if I play this through just isn't enough. Between them on. And you can just see it's selected one clip for the duration of the video and one audio file again for the duration. All I like to do is if you right click on the video and switch multi-cam clip angle and I've got the option of three angles. Now if I just change those it will change the clip while remaining in sync. What I'll do here is change to my primary, change to my best video output the one that I'll probably use most which in my case is angle three. And then you can do the same for the audio right click switch multi-cam clip angle angles one two and three. Now clip angle one for me is my primary so I'm going to leave it at that. Now up here in this preview window if you go to the transform icon there's a little drop down and you can select multi-cam and you'll see this screen so we've got all three clips. Now at the bottom here there's three little icons. This one on the far left is just video. This one in the middle is video and audio and this one on the right is just audio. Now I plugged my microphone into one camera so I know this audio clip never needs to change because this is my good audio. However I want to hop between my video clips so I'm going to click on this icon here to make sure that I only chop and change between video clips while the audio will remain consistent throughout. If you want to change both it's this one if you just want to change the audio is this icon here. Now you can do this in real time. So I'm going to scrub back to about here which looks like I start going. Get rid of that bit because I don't need that and I'm just going to hit space to start playing through. And as you can see as you're playing through you can see the end result here in your usual preview window and in this preview window you can see all three individual clips. Now at this point you can see that I'm moving away from this camera and I'm looking down at my angle two. So I've hit space to pause then all I'm going to do is click on angle two and it will add a cut in my video only my video because I'm using this icon here and then I can hit play. And I'm looking down at that camera and then I'll wait until I look at a different view which happens to be angle three so I can click on angle three again and play. Angle two and then angle three. And all you do is make your way through the clip clicking on the different angles to create your video. It's dead easy, it's dead simple and actually it's dead quick. And that's it, done. It really is as easy as that. Now as always if you enjoyed the content please pop me a thumbs up.
