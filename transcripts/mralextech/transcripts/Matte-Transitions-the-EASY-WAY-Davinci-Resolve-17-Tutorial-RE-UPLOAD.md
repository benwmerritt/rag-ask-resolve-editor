Matt transitions, they look a little something like this. They're just black and white pre-rendered transitions, which you can then use on your timeline to do something a little like this. Now they've been around for a long time, but in DaVinci Resolve of old, they used to be really fiddly to do. You just have to hop into the color page and mess around with stuff in there. As of DaVinci Resolve 17, they're now far, far easier. So we're going to show you how to do it. Now all of these transitions are downloaded for free. There's a link down in the description below, so you can go check them out for yourself, or just Google around for free Matt's transitions. And there are a few places where you can download these for free for yourself. Right, let me open a new timeline and I'll show you how to get cracking. So I'm going to grab two pieces of footage, just put it on my timeline like so. And it's this edit point here where we want to have our Matt transition. So this is the way I like to do it. Grab your first bit of footage, so this on the left here, and drag it up onto video track number three. So you need to have your first bit of footage on three, we're going to put our transition on two. And then our second piece of footage is on video track number one, then I'm going to grab a Matt transition. So I'm going to choose this triangle one. And I'm going to put this line up with the end of your first clip like so. We then just need to grab our footage and bring it back underneath. You need to have all three stacks on top of each other like so. Now what I like to do here, just to make sure that everything is nice and tidy, I'll come to this first bit of footage on our track number three. I'll put my playhead just before the Matt transition, there were control and B to cut, and then I'll bring this back down. That just helps to keep your timeline a little bit tidier. You're not just constantly having to make new tracks and mess around, it just makes life a little bit easier. Then we're going to click on this footage here on track number three, make sure it's highlighted in red, open up the inspector, make sure you're on the video tab, come down to composite, click that if you don't see the options under there, and then you've got composite mode. Click on the drop down, scroll all the way down, and you want to make this the foreground. Then we're going to click on our Matt transition, open up the inspector once again, same place, video, composite, scroll all the way down, and then you need to select either lump which is for luminance or inverted. So I'm going to click on lump for now, and if we hit play, we can see it's working, but it's the wrong way round. So we just need to change that to inverted, and then we'll hit play, and that's much better. That's looking the right way round. Depending on how the transition was made, so you can see we've got black and white, whether it's black and white or white and black, would depend on whether you need to select the luminance or the inverted luminance. If you need to do any more, you just do the exact same thing, and it's as easy as that.
