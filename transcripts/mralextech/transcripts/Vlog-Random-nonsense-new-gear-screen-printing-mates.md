## Transcript
You can do a little intro bit, go on. Yeah, because I'm going to do a little video anyway. I don't know what to say though, I'm really thought. I usually have to think things through, although I'm like, Hello, my name's, what up folks? What up folks, it's Alex here. Right, quick video today. I wanted to do a quick video update, because I'm going to talk about some other stuff in a minute. But also, I've been working hard with my mate Rich, who's over there. He is a professional musician, and he's just releasing a new song, album, record, single? Single, releasing his first single. So I've been helping him with some merchandise. I will put a link in below. His name is Richard Watson. He's also on YouTube, so again, link will be in the description below. Go check him out, because he is awesome. And that's it really. I don't think that noise so much on new videos like... Like, yeah. You know what I found? You know when you have the moments where you realise that you're quite polite? Yeah. When I'm sat in a room on my own, apologising to myself for fucking it up. And I don't realise I do it, and then I watch it back and go, Why did I say sorry? There you go. So yeah, introduction. Rich. Rich. YouTube. Hello. There you go. And this is... Hopefully you can see that. It's still drying. It is. Currently drying. It's going for the wet look. So for those that don't know, actually most of you probably don't, I do a little bit of screen printing as well as my photography. So that's why I've been working on the merchandise with Rich. See, I have that sentence and then I have nowhere to go after it. And then I'm like... Anything you want to say? I've got my t-shirt inside out. Yeah. Rich has decided to wear his t-shirt inside out. I've got Jess in the dark. He's the height of trendiness. So yeah, flog. Flog number two. I've only ever done two blogs. Walla mia. Hang on. Shut up, Jess. This is... The cave. Slash shed. It's just a shed. But I have a... Screen print. And a heat print. So we've been printing up a load of vests to go with the big release of Rich's first single, which will be awesome. So keep your eyes peeled for Rich. Richard Watson, as I say, he's probably been doing a load more stuff and I may be linking it because I might be working with him a little bit more. So yeah, keep your eyes peeled. He's a top lad and he's a brilliant musician and the new single is cracking. So yeah, keep your eye out for it. Me. Wondering the shadows of your mind. Complete me. Always asking. But never knowing why. Can you feel me? What I'm also going to talk about today in this little vlog is I've been buying things again. So yeah, in a nutshell, I've had the Sony A7 for a few years and then about two years ago I also picked up a Canon 6D. So I'd use the 6D for certain things and I'd use the Sony for other things. Up until last week I still had that Canon 6D, but I since sold that. So I've sold the Canon and now I shoot with... I've still got the A7 but that's going to go soon. I have this A7R2 which is what I'm shooting on now. I know you also have the A6500. So that are my two bodies now. Because of all this change, I've also been changing a few lenses. So I've sold all my Canon gear which gave me a little bit of extra money. So I've picked up a Samyang 35mm f1.4 which I will be reviewing at some point. And I've also picked up the Samyang 24mm. Try that again. Samyang 24mm f2.8, tiny little pancake lens. Which is actually one I'm recording on at the minute. I'm impressed with both of them so far. The 24mm f2.8 is cheap, 250 quid which is cheap for what you're getting. It feels cheap if I'm completely honest with you. It doesn't feel like the 35mm Zeiss. So if you think the Samyang's are going to be an equivalent, they are in focal length and aperture but they're not in build quality. They're a long way off. However, they're also a quarter of the price. So, it swings around about. I'll be doing reviews on both of those soon. If you have a particular one you're interested in, if you'd rather see the 35mm or the 24mm first, pop a comment below and do let me know. I figured this was worth talking about. I don't usually express too much of an opinion in these vlogs. I'd just like to have a point and I talk about or review the things that I'm reviewing. But a lot is said about buying new equipment. You see conversations on Facebook and Reddit and all that sort of thing. About buying different equipment doesn't improve you as a photographer. And I would agree. However, if you're in a position where you can afford to buy these things, why wouldn't you? Like, I'm not rich, I'm not loaded, but I got some work doing my photography. So I've used that money to go back into photography by buying lenses. The same reason I bought the gimbal, same reason I've upgraded my cameras, is because you do a little bit of extra work and that goes back into my photography allowing me to purchase new things. I totally agree with what people say, that equipment doesn't make you a better photographer. It may enable you to get better shots in certain situations, but it doesn't improve your skills as a photographer. And I would agree with that. However, if you're in a position where you can buy something, in my view, go buy it. As long as you're not putting yourself in any debt or getting yourself in any financial trouble, do it. Why not? Photography for me is really still a hobby. It's a pastime, it's something I enjoy. Yes, I make a little bit of money off it here and there, but it's not a career. I enjoy these things, so while I earn money, I'm going to spend it on the thing that I enjoy. So that's just my two cents. In other news, exciting news in the camera world, both Nikon and Canon have just announced the details of their mirrorless cameras. Mixed bag, I think. I'll do a video where I'll go through all the specs as well. That's on the list. Last thing to say, I haven't done many videos recently. It's because I've just been working. So I work a nine to five. I have a desk job, which I work, and then I do photography on the side and a few other little bits. I have had some weddings to do, so that's kept me busy, and I've just been doing things at home, so I haven't had a chance to make another video. But things are calming down, so the videos will be back. I've got some reviews I want to do, some general vlogs, some general information videos. Hopefully I can do some more on the DaVinci Resolve, and the message is looking at me weird. And hopefully, yeah, I'll get back into the swing of making some videos. I have hit 200 subscribers, which is amazing, so thank you all very, very much for that. And my 35 mil Zeiss review seems to be doing really well. So people seem to like the review, so I will continue doing some of those. And that's it. That's it for this one. It's a bit of a mishmash vlog, because I wasn't sure whether I was going to have time to make one or not, but I've put some stuff together. So hopefully you enjoyed it, but I apologise if it's not the best vlog in the world. And I will be back soon with some more videos. You have my word.
