Right we're gonna watch that intro again, but this time I want you to look out for any cuts in the video See if you can spot them all and then pop a comment below before you carry on with the rest of this video So let me know how many you spot What up folks it's Alex here welcome to 5 minute Friday and today we're gonna have a look at the legendary smooth cut So let's get straight into it shall we? Did you see him? There were five five cuts in total so now let's have a look at that exact same footage But this time without the cuts What up folks good morning. Hello. I was Peter saying it's Alex here Me yes, you all know me. I'm here every week. Welcome to 5 minute Fridays even though it's a Saturday. I know it's a Saturday I'm late again. I apologize And today Yes, you've guessed it. We're gonna look at something within DaVinci Resolve as we always do We're gonna have a look at the legendary smooth cut Cut smooth cut cut cut. So let's get straight into it shall we yeah, why not? Let's do that. Hmm So there you go, that's the smooth cut It's really really useful especially if you're an incompetent youtuber like I am who makes lots of mistakes when talking to camera Yeah, it's incredibly easy to do so this is only gonna be a short video But it's worth talking about just in case you missed it now and that footage obviously I'm relatively still so it works really well But it still does a pretty good job even if you're a bit more flamboyant and moving around a little bit more So let's open DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you how it's done So here we are folks we're in DaVinci Resolve and we're on the edit tab now I've already added my video clips of the timeline and I've cut it up accordingly So you can see all these cuts here in the video now if I hit play at the moment They're not too bad because I don't move around too much, but the cuts are a little bit abrupt So we're gonna smooth them out using the smooth cut now You need to look for your effects library which looks like this bottom window here If you don't see this it's just because your effects library is closed at the toolbar and across the top You should see effects library with the magic wand give that a click to open up your effects library Now on the left you've got toolbox make sure that's expanded and then look for the video transitions Within the video transitions in the dissolve area you should see smooth cut now If you've never used transitions before in DaVinci Resolve, they're dead easy to add to the timeline. We simply click Drag put it over the two adjoining clip like so and then release Now if I hit play It'll smooth those two clips together if we just look about here You can see my eyes are doing something a little bit strange as it's trying to cut those and blend them together as best It can now I actually find the transition to be too long by default So what I like to do is just click on the edge of the transition on your timeline and Drag it in I like to make these really short about there and then if we hit play It smooth them together and it's just a little bit nicer and then if we just add them to the rest of the cuts And then if we hit play Much better And that's it folks Easy peasy don't forget to like comment subscribe if you found this useful and I'll see you next time Cheers you
