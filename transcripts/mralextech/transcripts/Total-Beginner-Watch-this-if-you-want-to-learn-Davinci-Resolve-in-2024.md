What up, folks? It's Alex. How are you all doing? I hope you're well. Welcome to the brand new year and welcome to a brand new series of five minute Friday videos. Each and every week of 2024, there's going to be a brand new five-ish mini video taking you through various bits within DaVinci Resolve. I say five-ish, five-ish, sometimes between five and 20 minutes. So let's call it five minute Friday because why not? Some of these are going to be fun. Others are going to be a little bit more creative showing you how to do some cool stuff. What others will be kind of boring but essential things that everyone needs to know to become pretty good, competent, good expert. It's good stuff. Stuff you need to know when working within DaVinci Resolve. Basically, over the next 52 videos within this very series, I'm going to try and cover as many of the essentials as I can in a fun, creative kind of way. I don't know. And to keep me consistent, to try and make sure that I stick with this, for every week that I miss, I'm going to give away DaVinci Resolve studio license. Yeah. So of course, I'm going to try and remain consistent because otherwise this is going to get expensive very, very quickly. We're also going to try and have a lot fun with this. Sometimes I'll just be stood here in my little studio doing my thing. Well, other times we'll be out and about. I might even try and get some special guests in throughout the year and there is going to be some other surprises too. So hopefully it's going to become a really fun, cool series that you'll look forward to seeing on a Friday. On top of that, there are of course going to be some other midweek videos on the channel for you to enjoy as well. Sometimes, unmassively varying topics because why not? Now, as mentioned, this is technically the first week. However, it doesn't really count. So I'm not going to show you anything particularly fun or exciting or even really that essential, but I am going to show you something. I wanted to give you the absolute bare bones, useful information about DaVinci Resolve. If you've just downloaded it or are considering jumping in. So a lot of you probably already know this, but let's kick things off with a few of the basics. Number one, free versus studio. There are two versions of DaVinci Resolve. Both versions are available for Windows, Mac and Linux. You get the free versions and the studio versions on all of those. And there is also an iPad version as well, but the free versus studio thing, the thing you need to know, the free version is really good. The free version will give you an awful lot. There's no time limits on it and you won't get any stupid watermarks when you go to render at the end. If you try and use anything which isn't available to you within the free version, you'll get watermarked straight away saying you can't use this. So there won't be any surprises when you go and check the render at the end, the actual exported video, and all of a sudden it's got a watermark on it. That doesn't happen in the free version. So download the free version, get stuck in, have a play with it and see if DaVinci Resolve is for you. What do you get in the studio version? Well, for starters, it's faster. You get GPU enabled, encoding and decoding, which just means everything kind of works a little bit faster. You also get access to more codecs. That's more useful for you guys that are on Windows. I've put a link down in the description to the codecs document, which hopefully will help explain things in slightly more detail. Now that studio license, it's about 300 bucks, depending on where you're from in the world. And it is a pay once there's no subscriptions, you pay once, and you can use DaVinci Resolve forever. And that includes updates. Blackmagic technically could change that at any time, but I don't think they will. You buy it once, there's no subscriptions, you can use it forever. Job done. You get two seats. So you get two installations of DaVinci Resolve Studio. So you can shove it onto a PC, for example, and a Mac or a Linux machine, you can mix and match between any of the different OSes. If you then go to install it on a third machine, all it does is it wipes the two logins, the two sessions of the previous two machines. So then you have your two seats back. So you have these rolling two seats. It's as simple as that. Number two, there are seven different pages or tabs within DaVinci Resolve. There's media, cut, edit, fusion, which is for 3D effects compositing and all that sort of stuff, color for color grading, fairlight, which is for all of your audio stuff, and deliver. I've put a link to this website down in the description below, which gives you a pretty good description of each of the different pages, why they're there, and what they do. When getting started in DaVinci Resolve, it's kind of confusing the fact there's all these different pages. But all you need to know is each one has its own specific function. However, you don't need to use all of them. Most people will just jump onto the edit page, which allows you to do all of your editing, create timelines, do some basic audio stuff, even some simple effects, titles, transitions, all that sort of thing from the edit page. And then to deliver it to export or render the video, you just jump over to the deliver page. You can use as much or as little of these different pages as you need to. It's as simple as that. It's also just worth noting that anything you do on one page will carry over to the other. It's just a different view of the exact same project that allows you to do different things. But anything you do on the color page, for example, you will then see on the cut page or the edit page or the fail-like page or the fusion page. You just hop in and out depending on what you're doing. So next up, there is a massive 4,000 page manual included with every single installation and I highly recommend that you check it out. It is massive. There's loads and loads of stuff in there, but it is one of the best ways to learn some of the ins and outs of DaVinci Resolve. If you're trying to use a feature and you're not sure how it works, just open up the manual, have a quick search for the thing you're trying to use and it will do a pretty good job of explaining what you need to do. Here's a pig, but ignore that. Once you're in any project within DaVinci Resolve, all you need to do, you click on help at the very top and then there is DaVinci Resolve reference manual. Give that a click. You don't even need to be on the internet because this is stored locally and it will open up the DaVinci Resolve 18.5 manual. There's no 18.6 version yet, I don't believe, so it'll open up the 18.5 version, but as you can see, it's huge and covers pretty much everything you need to know. So if we want to have a look at the color page, we can click color and there's all of these different pages covering all of the stuff that you might want to learn about. There's loads of stuff. Within the same area within DaVinci Resolve, help. There's also DaVinci Resolve training, which will take you to the DaVinci Resolve training website. This is super usual because there's loads of really good training materials on here. So again, if you're just getting stuck in, you're wanting to learn how to use the basics of DaVinci Resolve, this is one of the best places to start. For starters, there's a bunch of different training videos. They're like an hour long, they're available in different languages. You can download the video for free and you can even download the project files to use. There's ones on the edit page, the color page, fairlight page, fusion, and then there's also training books. So you can download the training book again for free as a PDF or you can buy the physical copy from Amazon if you prefer that. There's also lesson files and there's online exams. Again, they've got those for all of the different elements. You can even go here to find an actual in-person, real person to do some training for you instead. Winner. And last but not least, the online DaVinci Resolve community is growing. There's loads of DaVinci Resolve YouTubers out there trying to teach you things and trying to make DaVinci Resolve just that little bit easier to use and to get to grips with. I'm not going to list all of the YouTube channels here. Instead, check the pinned comment down below. I'm going to do a list of my favorites and as people recommend their own, I'll also keep updating that list to give you loads of people to go and check out. So this isn't five minutes, it's much more. But anyway, I hope this key information is useful to some of you out there. If you've got any ideas for videos you'd like to see within this series, please do shove them down in the comment section below. We're going to have loads of fun with this this year, hopefully. Fingers crossed. So stick around. Enjoy. Resolve, baby. I don't know. Thanks for watching. Take it easy. I will see you next week if I don't see you before. Cheerio.
