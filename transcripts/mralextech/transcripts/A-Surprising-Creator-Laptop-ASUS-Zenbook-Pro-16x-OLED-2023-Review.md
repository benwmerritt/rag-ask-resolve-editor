The performance is genuinely impressive for its size and weight, and the fact that it switches into this silent notebook kind of thing when out and about is a massive win. Introducing this, the ASUS ZenBook Pro 16X OLED. It's a creator focused Jekyll and Hyde Windows 11 laptop with desktop level performance, a solid aluminium chassis with a fancy lifting hinged keyboard and a lovely 3.2K 16x10 120Hz OLED display. With the latest Intel Core i9 CPU, an Nvidia RTX 4080 laptop GPU and 32GB of superfast LPDDR5X memory, this thing is fast. But it doesn't come cheap. So, let's talk about it. Now, ASUS did send this laptop to me for review, but this isn't a sponsored video. All opinions are my own, and ASUS don't get to see it before you do. Being OLED, the viewing angles are near infinite, the colours are vibrant, accurate too, as it's Pantone approved and covers 100% of the DCI P3 colour gamut. It's also a display HDR True Black 500 certified, which means contrast for days, and the tiny bezels result in a 90% screen to body ratio. That helps to keep the whole device relatively sized considering it's a 16 display, so it will fit into sleeves and bags designed for 15.6 inch devices. It's also surprisingly touchscreen, so you can get fingerprints all over that nice shiny display. It does come with Corning Gorilla Glass to keep it safe, and it also comes with this. This is the ASUS Pen 2.0. Now, this isn't a 2-in-1 device, and the screen doesn't fold flat, so using a stylus is a bit of an awkward experience. But, it does admittedly feel really responsive, so it is handy for the occasional annotation, signature or doodle. Peak brightness, 550 nits, which is plenty, response time 0.2 milliseconds, native resolution 3200x2000, and of course it is 120Hz, although it will switch to 60Hz by default when on battery, and the screen does go black for a brief moment when you do this. However, you can disable this feature in the MyASUS app if you prefer to run 120Hz all the time and sacrifice some battery life. In the same MyASUS app, you'll also find the ASUS OLED care options to help you look after that display. Now, the screen can be opened with a single pinky finger, which is always good, and the keyboard will pop up as you do. There's very little screen wobble or flex to speak of, and in fact, the whole laptop feels really well put together. The whole thing is made of aluminium, or aluminum if you're American, which feels nice, strong and durable. Apparently, it's military tested. Who knew? It's also pretty nice to look at, stylish and professional without being too shelty, although the brushed aluminium back does show smudges and fingerprints quite easily, so be careful with those dureto fingers. So how did they manage to fit all of that hardware in a relatively thin and light device like this? Well, ASUS Informi, they partnered with Intel to create what they're calling the Supernova System on a module. This combines the CPU and RAM onto a single board, and this is what allows for that crazy fast memory clock speeds of 7,467MHz, but it does unfortunately mean that RAM is non- upgradable. But it also reduces the size, taking up 38% less space, which means there's more room for other components like a bigger GPU and better cooling. And better cooling means more power. And power there is. In terms of pure CPU performance, in Cinebench 24, it absolutely wiped the floor with my MacBook Pro M1 Pro, coming much more in line with the M2 Max. It also comes in line with decent level desktop CPUs like the Core i7-12700K and the Ryzen 77700X. In the same Cinebench 24, but this time on the GPU test, it's miles ahead of anything from Apple, as you'd expect, more than doubling the score of the 76 Core M2 Ultra, actually sitting right in between the full-fat desktop RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090, which is crazy impressive for a laptop GPU. And here are the results from the Blackmagic RAW 8K 12-1 speed test and the Puget Bench benchmark 4DVS by Puget Systems. Storage is quick too, it's handled by a Samsung SSD, which is available up to 2TB. It's plenty fast and it is upgradable, but to me it's slightly disappointing there is only one bay as having an additional SSD to use as a media scratch disk is preferable when video editing. And talking about editing, how does it perform in DaVinci Resolve? Well, as you'd imagine, it flies. Whipping around the timeline is buttery smooth, it feels really nice. That 120Hz display just makes everything feel super responsive and it has the power to match. 4K, 4-2, 10-bit, F8-6 footage, easy, not a problem at all. 6K B-Raw, again, no issues whatsoever. The only footage I had some issues with was 4K, 4-2, 10-bit, long GOP from my Lumix S5 Mark II X. Try saying that fast. The footage is particularly hard to decode, my PC chugs a little bit as well. And I did experience some cursor slowdown and missed clicks when I was using the touchpad. Weirdly, those missed clicks went away when I plugged in a mouse though, so that could be a software-related issue. Interestingly, using the exact same footage, but this time in all Intra, so it's less compressed and it just goes buttery smooth once again. So it's something to do with the decoding, the decompressing, which is making things chug a little bit. Tried it with loads of other footage though and it was absolutely fine. So unless you're unlucky, you should be fine. Naural engine effects like magic masks and depth maps are all handled with absolute ease, honestly, many giving real-time playback even at 4K. Any that do struggle with real-time, like speed warps or adding all of the noise reduction in the world, are quickly rectified by simply dropping the timeline proxy to half and you back at real-time once again. It's also hella fast at creating proxies, which is always a bonus. So as a render benchmark, 10-minute timeline, 4K, various different footage, and some GPU-enabled effects and noise reduction. My PC ran this off in 4 minutes and 36 seconds while the Zenbook took 5 minutes and 44. My MacBook M1 Pro, 11 minutes and 3 seconds. The more GPU-enabled stuff you have on that timeline, the greater that difference is going to be. But what about on battery? Well, this is where things actually get surprisingly interesting. The Zenbook did it in 10 minutes and 50 seconds, while the MacBook, second time round, was a little bit quicker, 10 minutes and 53 seconds, so almost identical. But what about the battery life? Well, the Zenbook used 11% of its battery, while the MacBook used just 10%. The Zenbook Pro does have a considerably bigger battery, so it did use a lot more juice to render that out, but they came out at the same time and proportionally, you'd get the same amount of rendering done on either device. But I must add, on battery, the actual editing experience is still smoother, faster, and more consistent on the MacBooks. So they do still hold a fair advantage in that department, but powerful Windows devices like this Zenbook are moving in the right direction. What about gaming? Well, as you'd expect, it's equally as impressive. Cyberpunk 2077 is handled with relative ease once again, 60 frames per second, totally achievable, even on the highest setting with ray tracing, but you do need to use a little bit of DLSS. Drop it down as midge or disable ray tracing, and you'll easily see anywhere from 70 to 120 frames per second. The same goes for Warhammer Dark Tide, which it runs really well. And here's the obligatory shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark, where it hits 138 FPS. So making use of that 120 hertz refresh rate is absolutely possible, even in modern AAA games. Now this is a Windows laptop after all, so the fans do get loud, under load, but they really quickly quieten back down. Cooling is handled by twin fans and a 3D vapor chamber, which is all aided by that hinge. Now the underneath does get warm when running heavy tasks, so if you've got it on your lap, you will end up with a hot crotch. But the keyboard actually remains totally cool throughout, which is only a small thing, but it just makes for a much nicer general experience. And here's the thing that surprised me. When on battery, just doing everyday tasks like browsing, chrome, watching Netflix, doing some emails, whatever, it's legit silent. The fans, in my experience, rarely kick in, even on the high performance setting, and generally it remains pretty cool as well. I often had this on my lap with no issues whatsoever, and you won't feel like you're suffocating it if you leave it on your duvet while having a cheeky bit of Netflix and chill. And that to me is what gives this device its Jekyll and Hyde feel. It's a crazy powerful laptop when plugged in with genuine desktop level performance, but take it away from the socket and it turns into a really nice, chilled out, quiet laptop for working on the go. You don't however get notebook levels of battery life, even with that 96 watt hour battery. Prepare yourself for as little as four, but generally expect five to six and maybe eight hours at a push. That's just doing everyday tasks like emails, browsing, watching videos, that sort of thing. Obviously, start rendering or gaming and you'll be lucky to get 90 minutes to two hours out of it, kind of as expected. So, it's not the best battery life in the world, but it's not bad, it's been working okay for me. Charging is handled by a chunky 280 watt brick and the port is located on the left hand side, but you can also charge it via either of the two Thunderbolt 4 type C ports instead, also located on that same left hand side. When traveling, I've been opting to just take a 100 watt type C charger with me instead of the big chunky brick. It's plenty enough to charge it while doing everyday tasks and it will knock the screen back up to that 120 hertz. Start doing some heavy tasks though, it will start draining the battery. Now those type C ports are super fast as well as you'd expect, Thunderbolt, so they're great for external SSDs and can of course also be used for external displays. Next to those, you'll also find a USB 3.2 Gen2 type A port, whilst on the right hand side we've got a HDMI 2.1 port, an audio mic, combo jack and a full-size SD card reader. Now besides the obvious calling benefits, that hinge also lifts the keyboard up, up to 14.5 millimeters and angles it up to 7 degrees. That puts it much more in line with the traditional physical desktop keyboard, which for me is a much nicer typing experience. Providing you've got room to spread out and have it as you usually would. If you're stuck with the keyboard really close to you, like on a flight for example, it can start to feel a little bit harsh on the old wrists. Also quick note, anything left in that hinge when you close the lid will get demolished, so just keep that in mind if you've got little kiddies around. The keyboard itself though, it's nice. 1.4 millimeters of travel and it's all nicely spaced out if a little shifted over to the left. It's backlit too with per key RBG, which again can all be controlled and customised as required. What can't be switched off though, weirdly, are these LED strips located within the hinge itself. Now they do look cool, they will match the keyboard, but they can actually be a little bit distracting for others in low light environments, again like on a flight for example. Top right is where you'll find the power button, which also doubles as a really quite quick fingerprint reader for login. Or you can log in with your face using the 1080p webcam which looks and sounds like this. It also does have an IR array, so it should log in with Windows Hello, pretty consistently even in low light conditions. There are also two function keys, one to disable the microphone and one to disable the camera, but unfortunately no physical privacy switch. There's two speakers located either side of the keyboard and another four facing downwards. Volume, excellent, these speakers are actually really loud, sat in my usual position, anything above 70% is actually borderline uncomfortable. I've been running them around 25 to 30. They do sound decent enough as well, although do start to sound kind of tinny and lacking a bit of bass up at the upper levels. Then there's the touchpad, which is mohoussive. As you'd expect, it's multi-touch which makes whipping around Windows nice and easy. You do need to get used to doing a two finger click for a right click because the bottom right hand corner is actually quite hard to find just because it's so big. Now it also doesn't physically move at all, instead it uses haptic feedback, so it gives you a little vibrations whenever you click. It does work well though, the clicks are nice and obvious, so I have no issues with that. Palm rejection is another thing which works well and that is required due to the pure side of the thing you will almost always be leaning your palm on it. Push the little button in the right hand corner and the ASUS number pad will spring into life. You can still actually use the touchpad as a touchpad when the number pad is active, you just do a full depress for a normal mouse click and a light little tapy tap for the number pad. Now weirdly, hitting the numbers doesn't actually provide any haptic feedback, so it's not particularly tactile, it won't replace a proper physical number pad, but it's better than nothing and admittedly, it does look pretty cool. And then last but not least, we have this, the ASUS dial. By default, you can use it to control things like brightness and volume within Windows, but honestly, I just find it easier to do both of those using the function keys. I know where they are, they're quick, job done. Fortunately, you can also customize it to do other things in your favorite software. It also comes with defaults of things like Photoshop and DaVinci Resolve, where you can use it to whip around the timeline and do all that sort of stuff. You can also add your own custom function, so I added some that zoomed in and out of the timeline and also allowed me to nudge clips left and right on the timeline, all that sort of stuff, it's all fully customizable. Overall, it's nice to have, but pretty much anything you can do on there, you can just do on the touchpad itself, and it's not tactile enough to replace something like the speed editor, so I didn't find myself using it all that much, but I never found myself knocking it accidentally either side, you know, take you or leave it. So overall, I really liked this laptop more than I was expecting if I'm totally honest, I think it's probably one of the best Windows, if not the best Windows laptop that I've used. The performance is genuinely impressive for its size and weight, and the fact that it switches into this silent notebook kind of thing, when out and about, is a massive win. I actually found myself reaching for this over my MacBook. I was in America for ResolveCon, I had the option of which to take, and I chose to take the ZenBook, and it worked really well. I also gave a presentation recently, again, talking about DaVinci Resolve for a good hour, and it was absolutely faultless, and everyone was impressed with the performance of DaVinci Resolve running on this laptop. Would I recommend it? Yes. If you're looking for the ultimate Windows laptop, which does a bit of everything, and is kind of a perfect office to office device, which you can use out and about, if you just need to reply to some emails, or do some word processing, or watching Netflix, or whatever, it's kind of perfect for that. So that's my opinion. Let me know what you think, down in the comment section below. I hope you enjoyed this video. If you did, let me know that as well. Thanks for watching. Take it easy. See you next time.
