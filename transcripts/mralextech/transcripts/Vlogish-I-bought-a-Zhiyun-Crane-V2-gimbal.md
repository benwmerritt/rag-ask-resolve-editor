What up folks? It's Alex here. Right, I've been spending some money. I've bought myself an electronic gimbal. Which one you ask? It's the Xeon Crane version 2. Not the number 2. Xeon Crane number 1 version 2. What do you want? What? Yeah, it's fine. I wasn't busy. I've had my arm off for a while, if I'm honest. I just couldn't justify the cost. Then I had some money coming from some work so I figured yeah, why not? We'll pick one up. I was going to grab it on Amazon, but then I found one on the classifieds used near me for half the price of the Amazon one. So I went and picked it up and job done. Perfect condition. Nothing wrong with it at all. So in this video I just wanted to A. Tell you I've got it. B. I'm not going to do one on boxing but I'll show you the box and the packaging. And then I'm going to roll some B. Roll some test footage which I've shot with it just out in the garden. Nothing exciting but I hope it will give you an idea of how this thing works. So as the weather's so good, let's go outside. This whole YouTube teleportation thing is playing up again. Let's try the fist bump. No, no, in the shower. Not cool, right. Chest bump. Yeah. Let's start off by saying I don't know how to pronounce it. I think it's Zhiyun. Zhiyun crane. There you go. Zhiyun. Here it is. This is the box it comes in. Nothing too exciting. It's a three axis 360 degree gimbal. What it essentially means is it holds your camera steady. There's lots of different axes to balance and it'll keep your camera in the right place so you can record video and you can move around and you shouldn't end up with really, really chubby video. It comes with two batteries. Each one is apparently good for about six hours so you get 12 hours battery life total. I haven't had it that long so I can't test that but in my use of any size it won't be messing around with it a fair bit and the batteries seem absolutely fine so you know I can believe their claim. The actual device itself weighs 950 grams not including the battery so it's about a kilo or so when you put the batteries in. The payload weight is between 350 grams and 1800 grams so 1.8 kilos essentially. I shoot with the Sony a7. At the minute I'm shooting with the tiny Zeiss 35mm f2.8 and it's doing a cracking job. A couple of things really quickly to mention. It doesn't come with a quick release plate. You have to unscrew it every time you want to mount a camera. So I bought a tripod quick release plate of Amazon and I've adapted that to it instead. And number two, there's a cable. You can actually connect your camera to the gimbal using the cable. Now that's not supplied but you can find it on Amazon. It's about 20 quid. It's well worth the purchase. If anything it's just so that you can actually hit the record button to stop and start your videos. Now that may only sound like a small thing but it's really handy not to have to find the little record button on the camera. So I'll definitely rank it then that too. Get this hard case which is really really handy. And then inside you get two batteries to crane itself and then a handful of little bits to make sure that it works essentially. And that's it. Right, enough of me waffling. Let's roll some footage which I shot with this. All of this was shot with the original Sony a7 at 1080p mixture of 60fps and 24fps with the Sony FE 85mm 1.8. I shot wide open and they used the variable ND filter to keep my shutter speed at either 150th or 120th of a second depending on my frame rate. So roll the footage. So I hope that was useful for you. I'm really impressed with it so far. It seems really good. I'm going to keep using it and going to do some more B-rolls and more vlogs with it. I'm currently holding it handheld at the minute at arm's length. It's two kilos probably so it's not the heaviest thing in the world. We couldn't do this all day but for this sort of short bit it's absolutely fine. It's also worth noting that the a7 and the 35mm that I'm using at the moment neither of those have any stabilisation. So all this steady shot that you see at the minute, your swappan's, is purely from the Xeon crane. So hopefully that gives you an idea along with the B-roll we've just seen of exactly how smooth and how steady this thing is. So that's it. That's a wrap.
