What's up, it's Alex here and I'm here with the Zian Smooth Q. This is my gimbal for my phone which I ordered. This is super quick unboxing. I'm on my lunch break so I've literally got like 10 minutes so I'm going to blast it so it's really quick but hopefully it'll be useful for you. So yeah, this is the Zian Smooth Q 3-axis smartphone stabiliser. It was a bargain. There is a new one coming out. There is a Zian Smooth 4 but I've gone for this one because the prices have dropped and you get this for less than a hundred quid which is a bit of a bargain for a 3-axis stabilised gimbal for your phone. So I've got it from Amazon. There's loads of places you can get it but obviously Amazon is dead easy so I'll always go for Amazon. I've not opened it yet. I've not looked at it. I don't know what's in the box so I'm going to have a quick look now. I have my trusty pair of scissors. We are in. Look at that. How do we get into this then? And we're in. So what have we got? Nothing complicated here. We have this. Get rid of that bag. Don't care about that. Ooh. Zian. Zian. I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right. Zian. There you go. It looks like a tiny little guitar or like a lele or something. Carry case. It's quite nice actually. Let's try a fresh bag. Silica gel. Always fun. I've not read the instructions. I've not watched any tutorial videos on this really. Couple of reviews but not too much. It's got a nice feel to it. It's plastic obviously but it's a nice solid plastic. It's quite light but it feels dense. We have straight away we have a... A tripod mount on the bottom which is good because I've also bought a little mini tripod for it. We have a full size USB on the bottom. I presume that's for charging. Although we also have what looks to be a micro USB on the side and on the front we have a little toggle, mode button, an on off button and then like a joystick. That's adjustments that actually clamp for your phone. I can't put my phone in it because we're cutting it on at the moment. That looks nice enough. Let's see if it's got any juice. There it is. Ooh. It's vibrating at me. I should probably read the manual. Let's turn that off. Yeah, I'll do a full review on this. I just wanted to do an initial question. For the money it feels quite good. You're never too sure when you buy these Chinese manufacturers that could go either way. They could surprise you and be really nice or just be really trashy. This feels quite good. I'm quite impressed with that. Hopefully the proof is in the pudding. It may be useless, but from the reviews I watched it's not. So we'll give it a go. Let's put that back in the box. Let's attempt to put that back in. Oh yeah, there you go. We're in. Let's do that back up. What else have we got? So look at that. Instruction manual. I will read that. Clip. Sort of a strap. Oh, for the carry case. Won't ever use that. Oh. A USB to micro USB. So I assume the micro USB on the side was to charge it. Not too sure what the bottom USB was for than the full-size USB. Maybe you can use it to charge your phone. It is. The full-size USB is a power outlet port for charging of smartphone. Bosh. There you go. Quick unboxing. That's what you get. The carry case. The smooth Q and you get your USB. You get the strap that I will never need. I'm never just going to carry this on its own. We'll get it set up and I'll do a proper review. But I wanted to do a real quick unboxing while I was here. What time is it? I just have a few more minutes of my lunch break left and then I'm going to get back to work. So that's it. There it is. That's what you get in the box. I'll do a full review probably in the next few weeks. Hopefully sooner if I get some more time. Any questions, anything you want to know about this bad boy, let me know. That's it for now. Cheers.
