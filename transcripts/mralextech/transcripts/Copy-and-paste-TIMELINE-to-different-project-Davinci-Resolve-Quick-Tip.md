Hey, did you know you can copy a timeline and all of the media that's on that timeline from one project to another? You literally find the timeline hit control C open the other project hit control V and it'll paste it It's really obvious. It's really simple, but it's quite easily missed So let me open to venture resolve. I'll show you how it works and I've also got some other quick Timeliny tips for you as we go time. I need tips Timeliny tips Timeline tips Time so here's my existing project I want to copy a timeline from an old project Import it into this one because some things that I want to steal from it So all we're going to do open up the other project So we're going to click on our little house icon to open our project manager and then we need to locate the other project So I'm going to use this audio one here will double click and we're in this other project Now this is the timeline that I want to steal. This is my 30 YouTube timeline. It's got everything already on it All we need to do is to find the timeline within our media pool Now because I was quite sensible I made a timelines folder and I know the timeline is within there But you actually don't need to do that you can set up a smart bin So I've got a smart bin down here and it has a timelines folder So it will always contain the timelines. It doesn't matter where you save the time on within your media pool You can always just quickly go to timelines within the smart bin to find all of the timelines within your project It's a real quick simple trick, but it can save you loads of time to do this for yourself Make sure that you've got smart bins enabled if you haven't you click on these three little dots and then just enable the show smart bins Then click on DaVinci Resolve very top left go to preferences make sure you're on user at the top Editing from the menu on the left and then tick smart bin for timelines and save There you go You always know where your timelines are because you've got a timelines a smart bin set up Now this is the timeline we want to copy this 30 YouTube. So all we do we give it a click so it's highlighted in red Hit control and see on our keyboard to copy then we're going to go back to our project manager looking on a little housey icon We'll go back to my timelines project now We could paste it within here, but it is going to import all that media as well and things can become a bit of a mess So I'm going to make a new bin. I'm going to right click new bin I'll call this one old timeline or whatever or open this one up Click within the media pool within this bin and then just hit control and V to paste and there you go It's as easy as that we haven't had to enable anything. I haven't got dynamic project switching on You can just open up the other project copy come back paste and done if we double click it will open up And as you can see it's got all the media on there and it's all ready to go I want to copy some stuff from this timeline So I can literally just highlight it control and see and then jump back to my other timeline I can find my timeline within my timelines smart bin like so or if you want to quickly hop between them There is a little drop down at the top here. See this little arrow if we give that a click We can see all about timelines there so I can go to my existing timeline and Then just hit paste and we can paste anything across now There's one other quick tip you can also have tabbed timeline So rather than having to jump across here We can actually have multiple timelines open at once all you need to do click on this little icon to open up our timeline view options I don't know why it looks so small on my screen But it does and then click on this little icon this top left one here And that's going to enable this additional bar at the top here. You can say I've already got my existing timeline We can do the little drop down and select whichever time on we want to be open I want to add a new tab so I'm going to click plus Select timeline or changes to the 30 YouTube one and now I can always just copy something else Switch straight back to this one Paste it within here and it's a real quick way of hopping between the two timelines Which we've now got in one project. There you go. Hopefully you enjoyed this super quick video Let me know down below if you did. Thanks for watching. See you next time
