Did you know there's a paper generator in DaVinci Resolve which allows you to do stuff like this really quickly and really easily? So where'd you find it? Well, in DaVinci Resolve, simply open up the effects library, come on down to generators, scroll down within the list and under Fusion Generators, you've got paper and it does exactly what it says on the tin. Give it a click, drop it on your timeline and you'll get this papery sort of effect. Give it a click, open up the inspector top right hand corner, go to video, generator and then you've got some controls within here. You've got the Seath which basically changes the look of it and then you've got some exposure controls. So we've got gain, lift, gamma, contrast, brightness and saturation. Paper, it's just paper, looks a little bit nicer than the solid white background though so I quite like it. But what exactly can you do with it? Well, here's a few examples. First one, we've got this papery title screen. So I've got my paper on my timeline, first things first, I downloaded a couple of PNGs. This one is just like a coffee stain so we're going to put that on there and the next one is this pencil. I've linked them down in the description below so you can go and download them for yourself. I'm just going to do some transforming on these to get them exactly in the right place just using the inspector. So I'm going to go with something like that. I'm going to go to the titles, grab a text, we're going to put this on here. We're going to find a sort of handwritten style text. Again, I've linked this down below if you want to go download this one for yourself. It's called Homemade Apple and we're just going to put, ooh, paper. And then we're just going to change the color. So I'm going to click on my color box and I'm going to go with a nice light gray and I'll show you why. We'll click on OK and if we just zoom in, it looks OK. It's a nice light gray color but there's no texture coming through from the paper so it doesn't quite look right. What we're going to do, click on settings in the inspector. Within this list, scroll down until you get to the composite area and then change the composite mode to color burn. Then all of the texture, all of those speckles from the paper will actually come through onto the text making it look much nicer and much more realistic. And there you go. We've got our paper-y little title screen. Now this also works really well if you've got some images you want to display but you don't want to use a standard white solid color background. So I'm going to grab my image. I'm going to put it on top of this piece of paper on the timeline like so. We're going to give the image a click in the inspector. We're just going to zoom out a bit. From the effects library, we're going to go to open effects. I'm going to use a little search bar at the top and just type in drop in there to find the drop shadow. We'll put that on our image and there we go. We've got our paper-y background with our image with the drop shadow and it just looks quite nice. We could animate that, put a dynamic zoom on there just to give it a bit of motion. Job done. It's a nice little way of displaying an image. Next one, third and final one, Polaroids. Everyone loves that sort of fake Polaroid style picture effect. So I'll show you how to do that using this paper generator really quickly. So I've got my paper on my timeline. I'm going to grab my portrait image. So I'm just going to pop this on here like so. We're going to give the portrait image a click in the inspector. I'm just going to zoom this out a little bit like so. We're then going to click on the paper, same place in the inspector video. It will probably default to this generator tab. Just go to settings, come on down to cropping the second one down and we're just going to crop this in. So we're going to crop this into the left, something like that. Whatever it says in here, you can just replicate. So that's 1143.2. So in my right, 1143.2. And then we've got the same crop left and right. And then I'm going to crop the top in a little bit as well. Now we want to treat this as one thing. So what we're going to do, highlight both of them on the timeline. So the paper and our image, right click, top option, new compound clip. Give it a name if you want to. I'm just going to call this portrait or something like that. Click create and then I'll make this one thing. And then you can give it a click in the inspector. We can zoom this out, maybe give it a bit of a rotation, move it over to the left hand side. Let's put it up one track on the timeline. We'll make this paper go out a little bit more like so. Same thing, drop shadow. We'll pop that on our Polaroid and we've got a nice little Polaroid on there. We could maybe put a few more images on there or a title, dynamic zoom, give it a bit of animation and it'd look really quite nice. Paper, it's a paper generator in DaVinci Resolve. If you've got any more cool ideas for the paper generator, let me know down in the comment section below.
