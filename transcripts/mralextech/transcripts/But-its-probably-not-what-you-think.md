I did, I really did. I've quit my job and now I'm officially a full-time content creator, kind of, but I'm not full-time Mr. Alex Tech. Let me explain. Hey, folks, how you doing? It's me, it's Alex. I hope you're all good. I haven't been posting on YouTube for the past like two weeks or something, so I wanted to just hop on, give you a real quick update, let you know what's been going on. Let you know I'm still alive, I'm still here, all is well, but I've been busy and I've had some stuff going on. As you can guess from the title and probably the intro of this video once I've chopped it together, it's true, I've quit my job. I handed my noticing from the job I've been doing for like 14 years for my local government, handed my noticing about eight weeks ago, and I have quit. I finished and I no longer work for the government, which is nice to say, actually, but as mentioned, I'm not going full-time on this YouTube channel. I've actually got another full-time job. I am going to kind of be a full-time content creator because my new job is creating videos or at least part of the role is creating videos. So who is it that I work for? Well, I've actually got a job at Kofi. Yeah, I now officially work for Kofi. Now, if you don't know who Kofi are, Kofi is a service which I've used for a little while now. It allows me to have like a tip jar so you guys can donate, you can buy me a Kofi, send me a couple of quid, couple of dollars, that sort of thing. It's also how I distribute all of my free assets because they host it for free. You can download it and then I use a pay what you want option, so you can download them for free or you can tip me a couple of quid, couple of dollars or whatever for the effort. I really like the way the service works. You can use PayPal on it, which was a big plus. It's just a really nice service and they were looking for someone. I had a chat with them. I really liked their ethics. I really liked the people that ended up having conversations with. There's not much else to add. I quit my job and now I work for Kofi. Now, I haven't actually been doing much video work for them yet. I'm just trying to find my feet and I probably will do over the next couple of weeks. But eventually, you're going to see me popping up on their YouTube channel, on their social media, on their website and all that sort of fun stuff. So it's really exciting and I can't wait to get stuck in. And it is all thanks to this YouTube channel that I've got this job. It's thanks to this YouTube channel that my career is going in a totally different direction than it was a few years ago. If you'd asked me if I still doing that tech job in the next 10 years, I would have probably said yes. And now I'm not because things have taken a change and we're going somewhere totally new and totally unexpected from a few years ago. So thanks, everyone. Thanks all for your support. Thank you for your comments, your likes, your subscribes, your shares, everything. It's all thanks to you and thanks to the success of this channel that I'm able to change my career and have loads of fun, exciting things going on in my life. So thanks. It's awesome. Mega. Who'd have thought it, honestly, when I started this YouTube channel? I started it just for the fun of it. Just put out a few videos that seemed to do okay and then I stuck with it and now several years later, crazy stuff is happening. So I don't ever like to think of myself as motivational. It sounds douchey and yeah, I don't like that. But if you want to look at my sort of case, I started it for fun, didn't expect it to go anywhere and it has made a huge impact to most aspects of my life, essentially. So yeah, if you're thinking about something and you're not sure, just do it. Just get yourself on YouTube, have some fun, make some videos and you never know where it might take you. It's crazy. So yeah, things are changing, stuff's happening and I'm excited. So I've got a new job. Ha ha ha, which is cool. Now none of that means that anything is happening with this YouTube channel. Mr. Alex Tech is staying exactly where it is and it will continue to function as normal. If anything, it will allow me to be a little bit more consistent and I'll just have a bit more brain power and a little bit more brain space. So think about video. Video will be everything. It'll be the day job and it'll be my YouTube stuff. I'll have video on the brain, which should just allow me to do these a bit more. It was always difficult for me to go into like corporate brain mode and then come home and mess around with video, hopefully video being my entire being will actually make me a little bit more consistent and a little bit more focused so I can keep doing this YouTube stuff as well as doing some other things because actually a few weeks ago, I was also on a course with Blackmagic to become a certified trainer. I just need to do the final exam, which I've been struggling to get done because you know, new job and all that sort of stuff. But I'm going to get the final exam done as well. And then I will be a Blackmagic certified trainer. So once I've got that, I think I may start to open up some other things, maybe do some training courses, maybe do some one-to-one consulting training with people or even write and produce a course, all that sort of stuff. There's loads of options for me to really get stuck in. It just opens some doors. It gives me more freedom to think about exploring these options and just doing a bit more with all of this. So there's anything you'd like to see and until you know, let me know down in the comment section below. I'm always looking forward to reading what you guys and girls have to say. So yeah. But that's not all as well. Next week is another really exciting week because I'm off to America. For the very first time, I'm off to Resolve Con. Resolve Conference is a conference which is being put on by Casey Farris and his crew. It's also sponsored by Blackmagic. So it's actually quite a big deal this year around. There's a bunch of DaVinci Resolve YouTubers and other professionals are going out and we're all just doing little demos, little chats, Q&As, all that sort of fun stuff and there's Meet and Greet. So if you're in the area, if you're near Oregon, I think there are some tickets available. You can come out and you can hang with us. You can watch us doing that thing and we can have a chat and a beer afterwards, which will be really, really cool. Now the whole thing is also being hosted on Casey Farris' YouTube live. So the full two days will be there as a stream. So if you want to watch that as well, you can do. So you're not limited to just being there in person. The whole thing is available completely for free online. So you can watch us all doing that thing, which is, it's going to be really cool. It's going to be really, really fun and really, really exciting. Now I've never been to America before. So I'm taking my wife, we're going for the two days for ResolveCon and then we're also tacking on a bit of a holiday. We're going to go exploring. We go in Oregon, which is where the conference is, Sacramento, San Francisco, and then over to Boston and then home from there. So it's going to be really, really cool just to get over to the States, have a bit of an explore and just see what's going on. So I'm dead excited about that. I will probably do some vlogs, do some little videos while I'm over there. I don't know whether I'll post them on this channel or somewhere else. I've always promised vlogs for a long time, but I should do my best to do some other fun stuff as well as scheduling some videos ahead of time. So it won't just be another two week lull on this channel, but I'll figure something out. Now actually to do some vlogging, which I've been promising to do for a long time, I wanted to get a camera. These lumixes that I use are great for this sort of thing, but vlogging is not their thing. I went to the photography show the other day. I was looking at picking up like a small point and shoot so I could do some vlogs. I bought an A7 for, which is not really what I went in for, but I bought one with a Sigma 16 to 28, 2.8. So this is my little vlog setup. I'm going to start just making videos, family videos, stuff at home, and try and do some vlogs. I've promised vlogs for so many years and I always try it and I always fail. And part of the thing I think is just not having the capacity to think about everything. So hopefully that becomes a bit easier now as well, but I don't know. We'll see. We'll see what happens. So yeah, that's what's been going on with me. I wanted to give you a quick update and let you all know because it's really exciting. I'm very, very thankful to everyone that watches all these videos and has helped me get here. So thank you. I'm going to go have some dinner now. That's it. Thanks for watching and listening to me waffle. Take it easy. Normal service will resume very shortly on the channel. So thanks for watching all. Take it easy. I'll catch you next time.
