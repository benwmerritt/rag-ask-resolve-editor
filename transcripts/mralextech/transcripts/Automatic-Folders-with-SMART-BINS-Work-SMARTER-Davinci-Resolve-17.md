Be honest, who's media poll usually looks something like this? Just files and stuff everywhere and you never know what's what wouldn't it be awesome if you get DaVinci Resolve to automatically sort it all out for you. Every project puts stuff in some nice nearly little folders so you know exactly where everything is something like this. Grab all this, drop it in and straight away. I've got my audio filtered my camera, B camera, any gameplay 25, 15 frames per second screenshots and even my voiceover filtered out into folders like magic. Yeah, much better. Using a feature with IndiVinci Resolve called Smart Bins, super quick and easy to set up and will absolutely change the way you work. First thing you need to do is to enable them. Now if you open up Resolve on the edit page in the media pool you should see this little area down here called Smart Bins. If you don't just click on view at the very top, come on down to here where you've got show Smart Bins, give that a tick and then you'll have the option within here. Now in this folder that I've got set up, I've tried to use a bit of everything. So I've got two cameras which I shoot with an A cam and a B cam. I shoot at different frame rates 25 and 50 frames per second. I've got images in the format of JPEGs. I've got voiceover I recording WAV. I've got music that's generally MP3 and then I've also got gameplay that's in MKV because that's recorded from OBS and lastly I've got screenshots in the format of PNG. So loads of different stuff that I once sorted out into folders so I know exactly where it all is. So let's crack open the Smart Bins and I'll show you how to do it. So if we just come on down to this empty space here, right click and we've got an option to add a Smart Bin and then this window will appear. Now at the top you've got name so you want to give this a name. So I'm going to start off with something simple and I'm just going to go with images. I want all of my images into one simple folder. So I've gone with images. Over on the right we've got show in all projects. If you tick this box this Smart Bin will appear in every single project whether you create a new one in the future or whether you go back and open an old one. These Smart Bins will be here for you. So I generally just tick that all the time because if I don't want it I can always get rid of it but I'd rather tick it and have it there and not need it than need it and not have it. So we're going to give it a tick and then underneath here we've got match all and any. I'm just going to leave that as all for now. We'll come back to that a little bit later and then we've got these options. Now this first one you're probably going to want to leave on media pool properties because you probably won't have metadata unless you're using a really high-end camera. So we'll leave that as media pool properties and this is where the fun stuff happens. We've got file name and we've got all of these options to pick from. So we've got file name, clip name, real name, time codes, sub clips, resolutions, frame rates, all this sort of fun stuff. Now we're going to dig into a few of these in a moment but the first one the easiest one to have a quick look at come on down until you find clip type then give that a click and then you've got the option of is or is not. I'm going to leave it as is and then you've got this drop down and we've got things like video, audio, video and audio, stills, multi cams, timeline, compounds, all sorts of fun stuff in here. Now what you may have noticed is my media pool actually changes as I create this filter. So we can actually see exactly what this filter is doing. Now I've got it set to video but nothing's appearing. Why is that? Well my video has audio attached so I'd need to change that to be audio and video and then you can see all of my video with audio is now in here. We want images so I'm just going to change this drop down to stills and you can see it's automatically filtered this out to show all of my images within there so I can hit create and now within my smart bin I've got a user smart bins folder and I've got images. So if I go to my master bin there's everything and if I go to images there's all my images done. So let's do another one. We're going to right click add a smart bin. This one I'm just going to call audio showing all projects, file name, clip type is audio create done, audio images. So I mentioned that I shoot with two cameras so if you have a look here I've got one camera which the file name is PAA and then I've got another camera and the file name is PBB so I've got my A cam and my B cam and I want that to be automatically filtered. So again smart bin, right click add a smart bin. I'm going to call this one A cam showing all projects. Now this one obviously isn't a clip type instead it's a file name so I'm going to keep it as file name. I'm going to change contains, I could leave it as contains but I'm going to change this filter to be begins with. There's loads of different options within here but I'm going to go with begins with. I know my A cam footage begins with PAA. As I type it in it's automatically showing me what's going to be filtered that's perfect. Creator add a smart bin, B cam showing all projects, file name begins with PBBB create awesome. Now I've got A cam and B cam what about my gameplay footage? Right click smart bin this one I'm going to call gameplay showing all projects. For this one I want to come down to format. Again we've got contains does not contain I'm going to leave it as contains and then I'm going to put mkv within here again it's showing me this I've only got one clip that's perfect create that. So now we've got our A cam, a B cam and my gameplay and that format one is really cool. I've currently got images which is just all of my images I could have created one that has a format of PNG that would have been all my screenshots. I could have also made one that had a format of WAV which is all my voiceovers mb3 for audio. You get the idea you can just use that file format to split things up into different folders. How cool is that? What about that high speed and regular speed footage that 25 and 50 frames per second where you've guessed it right click add a smart bin this one's going to be called 25 FPS. Media pool properties, file name we're going to come down and we're just going to find frame rate and then I've got is or is not I'm going to change the is to be 25 showing all projects but if we have a look over here what it's done is it's included the audio as well because the project is 25 it's not just my videos it's showing my audio as well which I don't want so then we can start to do and we can start to do multiple filters so I'm going to click on the little plus at the end here and this gives me another line so I'm just going to go to the frame rate here change this to be clip type going to leave it as is I'm going to change the third option to be video and audio and there we go I've got all of my video that has audio attached that is 25 frames per second and we're going to hit create boom all my footage that's 25 frames per second is in there and ready to go and then of course you just repeat the exact same process for your higher frame rate footage now that filter reviews for that one is what's called an and filter there's two criteria and for all the footage to be included in that bin they have to meet both of those two criterias and and filter what if you want to do an or filter the example I'm using here I've got this footage which is dci 4k so proper 4k and I've got this footage which is ultra hd now in this example I don't really care I'm going to use them exactly the same way so I just want one bin which puts all of that 4k ish footage in that bin we can do that using an or filter so we're going to make a smart bin I'm going to call this 4k showing all projects this time we're going to come on down to resolution is and I'm going to put 4096 by 2160 which is my 4096 by 2160 awesome then I'm going to hit my plus resolution is this one I need 3 840 by 2160 now it's not going to come up with anything because this is currently an and I can't have a clip that meets both so this is where this little box comes in we change it from all to any and then it will show me any clips which meet either this top resolution or this bottom resolution giving us our 4096 and a 3840 simple smart bins well smart bro
