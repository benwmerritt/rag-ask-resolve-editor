DaVinci Resolve is full of effects. Yeah, even the free version. So it's actually quite easy to miss some of the surprisingly useful ones. Now, one or two of these are studio-only effects. But don't worry, I make it super clear which effects are limited to the paid-for studio version of DaVinci Resolve. And lastly, before we get into it, this video is sponsored by NVIDIA and box.co.uk. NVIDIA Studio is an initiative to use the RTX GPU to accelerate creative applications like DaVinci Resolve and design laptops and desktop systems that expect to a creative professional's needs. Like this Razer Blade 17, featuring the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti laptop GPU from box.co.uk. And with over one million customers and an excellent rating on trust pilot, box.co.uk have over 26 years of experience in tech from selling laptops, TVs, gaming PCs, components, and now NVIDIA Studio validated laptops made with creators in mind. So click the link down below and head over to box.co.uk to browse that range of NVIDIA Studio validated laptops with free delivery on select products and the ability to select your own delivery window. Winner, first up, we've got the Transform tool. Now I'm not talking about the transform controls within the inspector, there's actually a dedicated effect within the edit page called transform and it's really useful and it can do a bunch of really handy things. So let's take a look. So first thing we need to do, just to open up the effects library top left hand corner and then we're gonna come down to open effects. We're gonna spend most of our time looking at open effects within here. Now we've got our full list of all of our effects here. If you didn't know, there's a little magnifying glass at the top, you can give that a click to get this little search bar and you can search for effects. So we're just gonna simply type in transform and we're gonna find our transform effect and we're gonna drop that onto our timeline like so. Once that's been applied, give the clip a click on the timeline, open up the inspector and go to the effects tab. Within here, you'll see your transform controls. The first thing you can do is distortion or perspective warping or corner pinning, whatever you wanna call it. Simply change this control mode from sliders to interactive canvas and then underneath your preview window, you've got your little dropdown right here, give that a click and then go to the open effects overlay and this overlay will appear. If we click in the middle box, we can just drag this around and if we click in any of the top four boxes, we can actually just change the perspective. Do all the things that we want to do. It's a really useful handy way of doing this rather than trying to mess around with pitches and yours and doing all this sort of stuff. Just apply the transform, change it to interactive canvas and off you go. But that's not all. Let me just reset this. If we keep it as sliders this time around, scroll down to image adjustment and expand that and then within here, you've got edge rounding. If we just drag that all the way to the top, we can mask this out as a circle. It's the fastest way that I know of of masking something into a circle within DaVinci Resolve. We can then just use the transform tools. So let's zoom this out and change the position to put this wherever we want. If you need to change the image within the circle itself, you just need to jump back over to the video tab within the inspector and then you use these controls to move it around within the circle. But to move the circle itself, you go to effects and then use the controls within here. But that's still not everything. Let me just reset this once again, scroll down until you get to the advanced options and then you've got an edge behavior. We can change this to reflect, wrap around or replicate. So if I just go to reflect and then I'm gonna zoom this out, it's gonna reflect the edges like so. So we can have this as small as we like and it just makes this infinite sort of background. Really handy, if you've got an image, you've got a background, you just need to zoom it out but you want it to fill the entire frame. Come in here, change it to reflect and off you go. You can also change it to wrap around and then rather than reflecting, it's just gonna duplicate it as many times as you need to fill both the horizontal and the vertical. The transform tool is great. Not many people seem to know it's there. So definitely check it out. Next up, camera shake. So we're gonna find our camera shake within here. There it is. Now this shot here, if we just play, is completely locked off. It's just a locked off tripod shot. Sometimes that's what you want but sometimes you just wanna add a little bit of movement to it. So if we grab our camera shake and we can just apply it on here, hit play and we've just got this camera movement. There are lots of controls within here. So get stuck in and have a play. The main three to use there are at the top. Motion scale dictates how much it moves, sort of the actual distance it moves. Speed scale is the speed that it moves and then you can also apply some motion blur. So I want it to move a little bit, but also really slowly. And now we've just got this real subtle camera movement so it doesn't look like it's on a locked off tripod shot anymore, it looks like it's hand held. Next up, film damage. If you wanna make anything look a bit vintage like this, film damage is the answer. Now that's not to be confused with analog damage which is a studio only effect. The film damage effect is available in the free version and it's incredibly simple. So all we're gonna do, same thing, open effects, find the film damage, drag it onto our footage like so and it's gonna give it a sort of sepia tone. It's gonna add a bit of a vignette to the corners. It's gonna make it a little bit blurry and add a scratch and some dirt as well. You can control all of that within the effects area. So you can turn the dirt on and off. You can change the amount of film blur, the temperature and the tint shifts as well as the vignette. We can also disable or enable up to five scratches. So just go in here, have a play. There's loads of little settings to mess around with and it's quite good fun to create a vintage style effect. Now on a similar theme, we've also got JPEG damage which is something I like to create retro style effects. So same again, let's just find this one within here. It's simply called JPEG and we're gonna drop it onto this background here. So this is sort of a gamey style thing but I want it to look a little bit more retro. So I'm gonna grab the JPEG damage and just drop it on there like so. Open up the effects. We've got all of our controls within here. It's really simple. We've got quality. We can increase that or decrease it to change the amount of sort of compression. We've also got the resolution. So if we drop this down, we get way more pixels and we can change the frequency scale. Now of course, that's very similar to this Mosaic style effect. You're seeing on my face now. That also exists within the free version. Same place, just search for Mosaic and it's in there. But the main thing you want to use the Mosaic effect for is blurring someone's face like this. And that's quick and easy to do as well. We've got this clip here and we need to blur this person's face. Now what a lot of people forget is that all of the effects that sit within the effects library are also available from the color page. So I'm going to hop into the color page and in the top right-hand corner, we've got effects and we've got essentially the same list as we had before. It's not totally the same, but pretty much everything which exists on the edit page also exists within here. So if I was to grab the Mosaic blur, which is right at the top, drop it on this node, which is how you apply these effects within the color page and it's going to apply the Mosaic to the entire clip, which is not what we want. So let me just undo that with the Control-Z. The benefit of applying things on the color page is the fact that you can mask and you can track. So with nothing applied on this node here, we're going to come down to this little toolbar in the middle and this round circle with the four dots, this is called Power Window. Now you can grab Windows and you can choose the things that you want your effect to be applied to. So I'm going to give the circle a click and in my preview window, I'll see this circle. Now I'm just going to change this and put it on this person's face like so, roughly about there. Then we need to track it. So next to this little circle in the menu bar, there's this sort of balls eye icon, give that a click and this is our tracker. Now generally I turn off 3D for this sort of thing. 3D can really make things look a bit weird. We don't need to track it in 3D space. So we're just going to toggle that off. Now I'm actually not at the beginning of my clip. You can see my play head is about here. So to make it play forwards and backwards, so it does the full track, you just hit this icon which says track forwards and reverse. So we're going to give that a click and it's going to track this person's face. It doesn't matter if it's 100% accurate, it just needs to be roughly in the right area. Now if we grab the mosaic blur and we drop it on there, it's just going to apply that blur to that person's face. Within the effects area, which is basically like the inspector on the edit page, you've got all of your controls so we can change the pixel frequency and the cell shape and the aliasing, do all that sort of stuff. And job done, we've blurred this person's face with the mosaic blur. Now for you studio users out there, don't forget that there's actually a bunch of studio only effects hidden within this effects list on the color page. And there's some really, really clever stuff hidden within here. You've got things like the face refinement effect, which allows you to pick up on subjects faces and it will isolate their eyes and their brow and their lips and the cheeks. So you can change the color of the makeup. You can brighten their face, remove shadows, do loads of really clever stuff. Or if you're me, you just give everyone really rosy cheeks. Then there's the objects removal tool, which does exactly what it says on the tin and it allows you to really quickly remove objects from your footage and it will automatically fill in the blanks. And then there's also the depth map tool, which is a DaVinci Resolve 18 feature only recently released, which allows you to isolate background and foreground elements. So you can put fog into your scene in front of some people, but behind others. It's really clever and it's well worth checking out. I actually made a dedicated video about the depth map tool, so you can check it out down in the description below. Cool, next up we've got a fake anamorphic effect. We're back to the free version now by the way, because you can use the glow effect, which again is available in the free version. So let's take a quick look at that one. We're going to find glow within our effects library and we're going to drop it onto this footage here. Now by default, you just get a little bit of extra glow. It won't do too much at all. It won't look animal-fit. We won't get those horizontal lens flares. So what we need to do, give your footage a click in the effects area. You've got glow. The only one you need to change initially is this HV ratio. This is your horizontal vertical ratio. So if we increase this, drag it right up to the top. You can see we now start to get these horizontal lines. This is sort of a bodge. It's not a real anamorphic effect, but it kind of gives it the right look. We can then mess around with the spread to increase or decrease the size of this glow. And then we can also change to the shine threshold to make it brighter or darker. Have a play with all the controls in here. There's also gain, gamma and saturation down here. So you can increase those to get it looking exactly as you want it. It's a fun little tool. And in a pinch, I think it does a pretty good job. Now this one is a studio only feature once again, but I always forget it's there and it's not talked about all that often. So I wanted to mention it. And it's the smart reframe tool. And that's it on the edit page. So within the inspector, if you're using the studio version, underneath transform, you've got smart reframe. If you just expand that, you've got some really basic controls within here. So what does it do? Well, this video here is this surfer and he's going left to right. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna zoom right in. So now what's happening is he's passing in and out of the frame. Rather than having to key frame it to keep him within the shot, we're simply gonna click on reframe. Now once again, this is using AI. It's gonna pick out the subject and it's gonna automatically key frame the position. So now if we hit play, it's just gonna track a little surfer man as he goes left and right like so. I didn't have to do anything else. It just kind of works. Next up, we've got optical flow. This is again available within the free version. Now optical flow allows you to slow footage down even if it wasn't recorded at a high frame rate. Let me show you how it works. So we've got this footage here. This has actually already been slowed down and it's this guy doing a trick on a skateboard. But we wanna slow it down even more. So we're gonna come on down to our inspector in our speed change and let's change this to let's just go with about 40%. Now if we hit play, because we don't have enough frames, it's gonna look really, really choppy. So we can see all the individual frames. It's sort of stuttering. If we come down to this retime and scaling, in the retime process, change this to optical flow and now hit play. What it's gonna do is basically smudge the frames together. So it doesn't look perfect. You can see a bit of artifacting going on, but it looks a hell of a lot better. So if we play this again, this is with it on and this is with it off. So you can just slow this footage down even more and still make it look pretty smooth. Now if you're a DaVinci Resolve studio user, you can take that effect one step further by using Speed Warp. What Speed Warp does is it will try to actually create the missing frames, which means that the slow motion will look even better. The downside, it is a bit of a monster to run. You do need a very powerful PC to get this to run quickly. So let me show you how it works. So we've already got our optical flow set in the retime process. In the motion estimation, we give that a click, we can change this to Speed Warp. And now if we hit play, you can see that that looks almost perfect. What it's actually doing is recreating the missing frames. Rather than actually smudging them together, it's recreating them to give us some really, really good looking fake, essentially slow motion footage. We can keep this going all the way. Like so. Let me just give you a demonstration of that turned on. That's with Speed Warp on. If we toggle the whole thing off, really janky. It's a buttery smooth slow motion. How cool is that?
