This video is brought to you by Squarespace. You're probably already aware of some of the big headline features of DaVinci Resolve Studio, that's the paid version. Things like noise reduction, face refinement, magic masks, and the all new auto subtitles they introduced in DaVinci Resolve 18.5 beta. Plus there's the additional performance and codec bonuses too, most of which I've covered in a previous video which I've linked down below. But there are also some other really great DaVinci Studio features and effects which are often overlooked. But here's just a few that I particularly enjoy, either because they save me time or I just enjoy them because they look kind of cool. Now nearly all of the effects I'm going to show you are available both on the edit page within the effects library under open effects or from the effects library on the color page as well. So first up let's talk about halation. Halation is a visual effect most associated with film and it can give your footage a little extra something to make it look a little bit more cinematic. Halation actually refers to the effect where light spills over the edges of an exposed area of film causing a halo like or glowing effect around high contrast areas. That's the technical description. What it does is puts these nice fuzzy bits around the edges which just looks like film. Essentially it's become more popular recently due to things like the bloom and mist style filters, but you can fake it entirely within DaVinci Resolve Studio thanks to the built-in halation effect. So here we are on the edit page and we've got these two pieces of footage. This is actually some animal footage I just filmed from my garden of the trees and the bushes. Now it looks all right as it is but if we want to make it look a little bit more filmic so we'll add some halation. So I'm going to just jump directly onto the color page. We've got our nodes over here so we're just going to add a new node and then from the effects library on the right hand side we're just going to search for halation and we're going to drop the halation effect directly on this new node. Let's just zoom in a little bit. You can see we do now have this little sort of bloom effect going on. If we just disable that and enable it again you can see the effect. Now if we go to the effects area we have all of these additional controls. There's actually a ton of controls in here so we're not going to go through all of them. I'm just going to show you the main ones to really affect the halation effect. The first one is threshold so this controls the areas that are affected by the halation effect. If we lower this down the greater the effect if we increase it that actually lowers the overall effect. If we then scroll down there's secondary glow which actually controls the glow or the bloom effects that you're seeing. Really simple you just knock the strength up and down and you can see that glow effect appearing. And now if we just toggle that off and on you can see we get a real nice bloomy film style effect. If we hit play there we go. Now if we jump over to the second clip very similar we've got some bushes we've got some nice high contrast areas so let's just copy that grade straight across by right clicking on the previous one and apply grade and there we go. We've got our bloomy halation style effect and if we hit play looks really quite nice. You can also then amend the die layer reflections which is that color fringing that spill on the edges simply increase or decrease the strength as required. You can also then toy around with all of the other settings within the halation effect to get it looking exactly as you want it. I really like the halation effect it can get a little bit overdone quite quickly but I like the way it looks. I actually use a little bit of halation to this studio shot just to give a little bit of glow to that little light behind me. Now sticking with something very very similar is number two film grain. Now there is actually a built-in basic film grain function within the halation effect so you can just pop that on and then increase the strength, size, softness and saturation but there is a built-in film grain effect in studio as well. So we're going to stick with this same sample footage let's add another new node with Alt and S or Option and S and then we're going to search for film grain. We've got it just here we'll drop it on there like so and then the first thing you'll notice is you have a film grain preset so you can just change between 8mm, 16mm and 35mm so let's just go with 35mm and then you have a bunch of additional controls. Now it is quite hard to see especially on YouTube thanks to the compression so let's just knock up the opacity and then we can choose to just see the grain only if we want so we can see actually what's going on and then we can change the texture, the grain size, the aspect ratio, the offset, the symmetry, the softness, the saturation all that sort of stuff and if we just untick the grain only you can hopefully see that we've got all this lovely sort of film grain going on just adding a bit of texture to this footage. Right next up another one which is relatively easy to replicate in the free version, I've actually made a video about that in the past, link below as well but it's dead easy to do in the studio version and that is Tilt, Shift, Blur. Now Tilt, Shift, Blur basically just gives you a point of focus and then blurs the top and the bottom to give you a real shallow depth of field kind of effect. I really like it to do that cool miniature style effect especially on some drone footage but it's also really handy to control some depth of field on screen grabs or tutorials to make sure people are looking at the right thing or just to make it look a little bit fancier. Now this one we're going to do on the edit page so I've got my effects library open we're just going to search for Tilt, Shift and we have our Tilt, Shift, Blur and we're going to drop it on this drone footage like so give it a click in the inspector go to effects and you have all of your controls within here. But what I like to do come down underneath the preview window and make sure you have your open effects overlay turned on and then you get this on screen control and you can just put this where you like. So let's put this sort of over here on the little bridge and then if we hit play it has this really funky miniature style effect. There's tons of controls within the inspector you can change the blur type, the blur strength, you can also change the lens irish, the shape, the curvature, rotation as well as controlling the depth of field, sweep and range and all that sort of fun stuff. I really like it for that I think it looks really cool it can be a little bit overdone but it's nice to have and it's much easier to do within studio. Now as mentioned I really like it for just bringing focus to certain things on screen with screen grabs as well. So here's a shot from this video sponsor Squarespace and we're just going to drop this tilt shift blur on there once again and if I'm talking about this e-commerce made easy I can just drop this on there make that look nice then the only thing that's in focus is the e-commerce made easy the rest is blurred out and it just controls what people are looking at so without it everything's in focus they could be reading points one or three I want them to just look at number two so we can just toggle that on and it just means people are focusing on that area rather than everything else and talking of Squarespace if you're a video editor content creator or a professional of any kind to be honest you're probably going to need a website and that's where Squarespace comes in.

and that is the d flicker effect if you've ever shot anywhere with real mix lighting or a dodgy led or a fluorolite you'll have experienced flicker within your shot it's a pain to fix in the free version near impossible in fact but the studio version makes it super easy and you can fix it in literally seconds so let's have a look so we're going to do this one on the color page and as you can see I've got this footage here and this light in the background no matter what we did we couldn't get it to stop flickering so we just had to shoot as is knowing that I could fix it in post so what we're going to do open up the effects area we're going to search for d flicker grab the d flicker drop it on our node and that's pretty much it generally the default settings do a pretty good job as you can see it's stopped our flickering and it looks pretty good you do have some additional controls within here so we have the d flicker settings we can change from time lapse fluorolite or advanced controls generally speaking time lapse actually seems to do a really good job now one thing you will notice as Darren comes in there is a tiny bit of ghosting and that's one of the downsides to the d flicker effect it smudges the frames together so that you don't have flickering it just looks like a constant exposure but that can cause smudging or ghosting within any movement within the frame you do have some controls though so you can limit it underneath the restore original detail after d flicker you've got this detail to restore slider so the higher this number the greater the number the less the d flicker effects but the more detail you'll retain within the shot especially you can see i've increased it the flickers back a little bit but we have less ghosting within Darren whereas if we bring this right down there's very little flickering at all but as Darren comes in it's going to be a little bit smudgy so i'm going to leave that as is the other thing which you can do is actually limit where the d flicker effect is being applied so if we open up this speed optimization options there's a limit analysis area and then we get this box on screen i can just put this around the monitor roughly something like that and then the d flicker effects will only be applied within that box it's not perfect for our situation because Darren moves through the box but you get the idea the d flicker is only being applied here so any ghosting around the outside of the box will be reduced now just one quick example we've got this time lapse and as you can see same thing we've got flickering this obviously isn't an LED light it's just the fact the exposure is changing but again we can just drop the d flicker on there don't even need to change anything for this one and it just evens it out and makes it look much nicer and much less distracting next up we've got one called analogue damage and it allows you to make things look like old school tvs or security cameras like this and i really like it yes again it can be overdone but it's a really cool effect it's dead easy to apply and it just allows you to do some some really fun stuff so we're going to open up the effects library and then we're just going to do a quick search for analogue damage grab your analogue damage and drop it onto your footage and then within the inspector you've got a bunch of presets so we've got clean vhs we can go to early television security camera 1960s black and white there's loads of really cool stuff you can do within here then you've also got a bunch of controls so you've got the source you can change the vignette we've got a broadcast signal we can change the amount of noise the detail loss the ghosting color dial scan scan lines tv construction phosphor brightness defocus there's absolutely tons and tons of customizations that you can do within here the downside you can't actually save these customizations once you've amended them which is a bit of a pain i'd love to be able to make my own presets within here but you can't do that at the moment but you can just scrub through make any changes and make some really really fun effects next up we've got lens blur now this one is designed to accurately replicate actual camera blur giving you kind of nice bokeh a nice out of focus elements now you can get close to this look in the free version just using the gauzian blur like the standard blurs this is kind of 10 to 15 percent better it's just that little cherry on top but it is a nice thing to have so i'm going to combine it with the depth map to show you what it does so i've got this depth map set up on this footage here i have made a tutorial about the depth map ages ago that's down below as well if you'd like a new one let me know it's been a while so maybe i should do an updated one so the depth map effect is just picking up on this lady here as well as some of the middle ground elements like so and then we can apply our lens blur so we don't actually want it applied to her instead we want the opposite so i'm going to right click on my node add a node and then we're going to do an outside node which will of course affect everything but what we have selected then let's just find the lens blur drop that on there and straight away we've got quite nice realistic looking out of focus background blur it was already slightly blurred but we want to increase it so we've used the lens blur within the controls we've got shape type we can go real apertures or we can go creative then we can change the things like hearts and starfish starburst petals lips and eyes and all sorts of fun stuff if we keep it as real apertures we can then control the size the curvature the rotation the anamorphism the highlight all this sort of fun stuff it's quite a heavy effect to run so if you go to the speed controls you can knock it down to quarter which means it won't look as good but it will run just a little bit smoother this shot here again i've done a depth map on there so let's toggle this on and we've used the isolated controls which are down here to try and replicate the actual line of focus given from the camera itself so she's in focus and some of the other bits are but then we have some black areas foreground and background which we want to add to the blur too so again let's add an outside node grab our lens blur pop it on there we've got some additional blow at the front and the back the foreground and the background let's increase that let's go a bit crazy with it and then hit play and it just helps us to isolate that subject while blowing the background and the foreground a little bit more it's not perfect i'd want to control that a bit more it's a bit overdone but you get the idea and last but not least the honorable mention clean feed clean feed allows you to do this we have a full screen preview on your second monitor while you can continue to edit as normal on your main monitor i use this all the time especially when i'm reviewing the edit it's super useful you can have your preview window on your primary screen all zoomed in so you can look at the fine detail while still reviewing everything as a whole on your second monitor if you're in a professional workflow it's kind of worth the price of studio on its own because it can make your life so so much easier to toggle it on it's simply a case of going to workspace video clean feed and then you can choose your monitor so i'm just going to go with monitor number one and then it will appear as required dead simple but it works really well it works on laptops everything else as well so it's a really really useful one to have if you enjoyed this video let me know any thoughts comments feelings whatever down below thanks ever so much for watching and thank you to square space for sponsoring take easy i'll see you next time
