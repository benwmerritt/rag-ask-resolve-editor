What up folks, it's Alex here. Welcome to Five Minute Friday and in this video we're going to have a look at something called Dynamic Project Switching. Now Dynamic Project Switching does exactly what it says in the tin and it allows you to quickly and easily switch between multiple projects. Now there's something to bear in mind with this, when you use Dynamic Project Switching to open multiple projects they all sit in your RAM. So you don't want to have a really big project open in the background or try to edit another really big project because you'll be limiting the amount of RAM that DaVinci Resolve has access to because you're splitting it between two projects essentially which can have a significant performance impact. However it is a really handy way of copying multiple clips or sequences from one project to another. So let's open DaVinci Resolve and we'll take a look. Before you actually start utilizing the Dynamic Project Switching you first need to enable it and you do so from this screen here. This is the project manager and it should be the first screen you see when you open DaVinci Resolve. Now to enable the Dynamic Project Switching all we need to do is right click on any of these empty spaces here and in this list we can see Dynamic Project Switching, give it a click and that's it. Now it'll look like nothing's happened but if we right click again we can now see that it is enabled. So what I'm going to do here is open this project here and DaVinci Resolve will load in exactly the same way as normal. Now this is fine, I've got my timeline, I've got all my media, we're all good to go but what I now want to do is open another project. So we're going to click on File, we're going to go to our project manager or we could have used the shortcut Shift and 1 and now I can open a second project. So I'm going to open this one here and this one will now open individual Resolve. So I've got my timeline and I've got my files over here. Now you'll notice at the top of the screen we've got Auto Audio Sync which is the name of this project and I've now got a down arrow. So I've got a submenu here so I can click that and I can see my Mixed-A-Review. That was the project I had open initially. So if I give that a click, I can simply switch between the two projects. So we've got this one here and we can go back now to the Auto Audio Sync project. Now also if we click on File, we've got two extra menu items here. We've got Switch Project which does the exact same thing I was just showing you so you can hop between the two. We've also got Close Project. So I'm in the Auto Audio Sync at the moment. If I want to close the Mixed-A-E9 review so I can clear out some of that RAM, I can do so by simply clicking Close Project Mixed-A-E9. Now one of the big benefits of using the Dynamic Project Switching is being able to easily copy files from one project to another. So now let's say for example this was a sequence here which I wanted to use in my other project. If I highlight it on my timeline, I can then right click, click on Copy. Now if I go to my drop down menu here and selects my Mixed-A-Review, this will open straight up. Now on my timeline, I can right click and I can paste and it will paste all those clips from the other project onto my timeline and it will also add the required media files directly to the media pool. And now I'm done. I can go to File, Close Project, close my Auto Audio Sync. That will close from the background, freeing up that system RAM and now I can continue to edit and work on this project as I need it. And that's it. That's Dynamic Project Switching in DaVinci Resolve. And that's it. Easy as that. Hope that was useful. If it was, give me a thumbs up.

Now make sure you tune in next week because we've got a couple of really cool videos where we're going to have a look at some transitions into DaVinci Resolve. So make sure you tune in for that one. Thanks for watching folks. I'll see you next time. Cheerio.
