What up folks, it's Alex here. Now for those that don't know, I made the decision to temporarily replace my big main beastly editing PC with a tiny, cheap, fanless, nook-style 80-quid PC I got from Amazon combined with this cloud-based computing system called Shadow. If you wanna know more about this little PC or you don't have a clue what I'm talking about when I say Shadow, check the description below. There's links to two of my other videos that should give you all the information you need. Now those that are familiar with my channel know I do a bunch of tutorial videos on the editing suite DaVinci Resolve. Now those videos are a little bit different to your standard vlog-style video because they don't just contain talking to camera or B-roll, they've also got voiceover work as well as screen capture. So in this video, I'm gonna talk you through my entire setup as well as showing you exactly how I go about creating those tutorial videos using this dirt cheap PC and Shadow. First off, the camera. The camera is a Sony A6500. I record at 1080p, 24 frames per second. The lens is a Sigma 16 millimeter F 1.4. The microphone attaches a shotgun microphone. It's a Tacstar SGC598. It's a nice, cheap alternative to some of the more popular branded shotgun microphones out there. This microphone here is my voiceover microphone. It's an Auna, A-U-N-A 900 mic. It's called Mike 900. It's a USB condenser mic. Wasn't cheap, it's about 70 quid on Amazon, but it feels really well made and the sound quality is very, very, very good. I also have an Anker USB3 hub because this little PC doesn't have enough USB ports. And last but not least, I have a Samsung external hard drive. From a software point of view, I use DaVinci Resolve. Obviously, don't need to say anything more about that. From my screen capture, I use Camtasia Studio. Very, very, very good. It's quite an expensive piece of software, but fortunately I get it through work so I can't really complain about that. I then use Audacity to do some of my voiceover work. Now that's a new addition. I've only had to start using that since using this PC with Shadow. So I'll talk about that more in a moment. And last but not least, I use OneDrive. Right, with all that nerdy stuff out the way, let's talk about how I actually make these videos. And the very first thing I do is this bit. Now the reason I do that at the beginning is because I have to upload these video files to Shadow and that takes time. If I left this to the end, I'd have to sit and wait twiddly my thumbs while this was being uploaded. But if I do it at the beginning, I can set the files to upload and then I can carry on creating the rest of the video. Once I'm done, I take my memory card, my memory card reader, and I pop that into my USB hub, which is connected to the little PC. Now this is where OneDrive comes in. So I've plugged my memory card directly into the PC, which means I can access my video files directly from there. So as you can see here, I can hop onto the USB drive, browse to the folder which contains my video files, and let's grab a good few gigabytes. 1.4 gig. So I can copy that, shoot straight to my OneDrive folder. I've got a Shadow folder already set up and ready to go with a folder for demo. So I can just paste this in here. And all we're doing here is we're moving the files from the memory card to my external hard drive. So as you can see, it's moving pretty quickly. That's a USB 3 external hard drive, so it won't take very long at all. Now since we've copied those files to OneDrive, the OneDrive sync will figure out that those files are there and then they need uploading, and then it will automatically start uploading them to the cloud. So I can remove my card because they already exist on the external hard drive, and I can just go about my business, carry on, do what I'm doing, all of the time, the PC will be uploading those files to OneDrive, and then I can go and grab them from Shadow. Now while all that's uploading, I can hop onto my Shadow, open DaVinci Resolve, and open Camtasia, and start doing my actual screen recording of this tutorial. Now this is where I hit my first real stumbling block when trying to do all this on Shadow, and it comes down to sound quality. Now the audio you're hearing now isn't recorded from my shotgun mic on my camera, unlike the rest of this video, it's recorded from this condenser mic, which as I mentioned earlier, is very, very good, but this audio is being recorded on my Shadow, and as you can hear, it's not very good, it's just not all that great. Now I don't think it's anything in my settings, I've set my microphone up in exactly the same way as everyone else has, and unfortunately the sound quality just isn't up to par. Now this audio quality, you'll have to take my word for it, but it's absolutely fine for things like Discord, voice chat, general gaming, that sort of thing, it's absolutely fine. But if you're doing a YouTube video and you spent 70 quid on a microphone, you want it to sound better than this, in my opinion. Now Audacity is a program that allows you to record audio. So what I've done is I've installed Audacity on the local PC, so it's not installed on Shadow, instead it's running on the little PC itself. All this audio that you're hearing now is being recorded in Audacity on this local PC. So how do I make that work for my tutorials? Well it's actually quite simple. I have Shadow open with DaVinci Resolve and Camtasia, and I set the screen to start recording with audio. I also, at exactly the same time, have Audacity recording on the local PC. So the audio is actually being recorded in two places. We're recording within Camtasia on the Shadow, and it's also recording in Audacity on the local PC. So once I've recorded, I just export the WAV file, I upload it to my OneDrive, which I can then grab off Shadow, and then I replace the bad audio with really good audio. Wee! So now I've finished everything I need to do in Camtasia. I've done my screen recording, I've done all my little animations, I've moved my voiceover across there as well, so that's all done. Now usually by this point, about half an hour or an hour has passed. So all of the video footage has had time to upload, so that's now there on Shadow as well. So now at this point, everything I need is sat on Shadow. My video footage has successfully uploaded, all the screen capture and everything's done locally within Shadow, so that doesn't need to be uploaded, that's already there, and I've moved my audio across. So I've got everything I need. So at this point, I can just boot up DaVinci Resolve and start chopping everything together in exactly the same way I would on a local machine. Honestly, I was worried this would be a difficult thing to move to, moving from doing it all locally and conveniently on my PC to running on this tiny PC with Shadow, but actually it's not that bad. Overall, is it as effective as a big expensive PC? No, the big expensive PC is more convenient. If I've done my videos and I've uploaded them to Shadow and then realized that actually I missed the key piece of information or I just want to reshoot it, it's obviously a pain, because I've got to get my camera out, reshoot what I need to shoot, and then wait for it to re-upload before I can edit it. If I do it locally, the process is much quicker. If I want to put a silver lining on that, it means that I just get better at planning my videos. It forces me to put more thought into what I'm going to say beforehand, rather than just winging it like I usually do, to be honest with you. So that's it. I hope this video was useful. I just wanted to show you the process I use, and hopefully you can take something away from it. Probably not the most exciting video in the world, but there you go. I've still got more to say about this setup. I want to give you a general overview in terms of what it's like for general PC usage and gaming, not just video editing. So I'll look to get that done shortly as well. One last thing, I've now got a Shadow Ghost, which is their new proprietary thin client. I'll be making a video on that.
