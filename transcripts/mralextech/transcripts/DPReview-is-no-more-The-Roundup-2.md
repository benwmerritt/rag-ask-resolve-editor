What's up folks, welcome to the roundup with me, MrAlexTech, brought to you by our friends over at Squarespace. We've got a bit of a mixture of things this week, so let's start off with the bad news and get it out of the way. Unfortunately, dpreview.com is being closed down on April the 10th, which honestly just sucks. And it's not just being closed, but it's basically being deleted, being wiped off the internet entirely. Now, if you're not actually familiar with the website, they do photography equipment, camera accessories, reviews, plus news updates, articles, and all that sort of stuff. Plus, there's a giant, really useful forum containing literally millions upon millions of posts, many by working professionals. And they have a truly brilliant YouTube channel hosted by Jordan Drake and Chris Nichols. If I ever wanted a camera or a lens review, that's where I looked. I went over to dpreview, they do loads of really great reviews and other videos. It's just a really great YouTube channel. Fortunately, Jordan and Chris have found a new home over at Pettipixel, so they will be continuing to make videos over there. But unfortunately, the same likely can't be said for the rest of the staff from dpreview who have been let go. It all just totally sucks for everyone involved. I personally wish everyone who's losing their jobs, well, I hope they can find something that can move along to somewhere similar. And I also hope that maybe someone comes along and gives dpreview a second chance because it's such a great resource, I'd like to see it maintained on the internet. So fingers crossed, who knows, it's such a shame that there you go. dpreview is coming to an end. In other news, there are rumors circling around the much anticipated Lumix S1H Mark II. Now the S5 II, which I actually use, I have, it's a really cracking camera for both photography and videography. It's got loads of video options, loads of flexibility, really fantastic autofocus, and it comes in a really competitive price comparatively. Now the original S1H is of course the flagship from the Panasonic's full frame range of video centric cameras. So we can assume the S1H II is A, going to be massive, B, going to be quite expensive, but it is also going to be an absolute powerhouse. This time we can also pretty much guarantee that it's going to have good autofocus because Lumix have been putting loads of effort into their autofocus. So it should come with the new much improved face detection autofocus, which is found in the S5 Mark II. In terms of other specs, the rumors suggest that it will be a 50 megapixel full frame sensor. Now all the other cameras within the Lumix range, or the other full frame cameras within the Lumix range, I should say, have a super 35 millimeter, 1.5 times crop when shooting anything above 30 frames per second. So ultra HD, 64K, 64K, 120, whatever, hopefully should be without a crop. You think it would be. This is that flagship. There are loads of other cameras out there now in the higher end that do do, do, do, do, 4K, 120. So fingers crossed for that. Now another thing, which is why I think it's relevant for a lot of us, the much anticipated S5 Mark II X will have the ability to record ProRes 422 HQ and 10 bit all-intra directly to an SSD via its Type-C port. So again, it's probably safe to assume the S1H Mark II will offer something very similar, if not adding more, hopefully something like RAW as well. So the original S1H can do Blackmagic RAW and ProRes RAW to an external recorder. I for one would love to see that being done internally on the S1H Mark II. A mirrorless style Lumix camera, 50 megapixel that does everything, including autofocus really, really well with Blackmagic RAW internally to an SSD, but you know, without actually having to use an external recorder would be awesome. The other thing that's really going to happen, probably not. It probably comes down to Blackmagic and licensing and all that sort of stuff, but it would be really, really cool to see. Now the original S1H once launched for close to four grand. It was like for an half grand in the UK, $4,000 US, which does put it firmly in that professional area of cameras, but they came in quite aggressively with the price of the S5 Mark II. It undercuts some of its competition, so maybe they're going to do the same with the S1H Mark II, but realistically probably going to be three to four grand in that ballpark. Anyway, now if you're not a Lumix user, don't care about Lumix, you're more of a Sony user. They are announcing a new camera on the 29th March, which is just in a couple of days. It's believed to be the ZVE-1, which is a small vlogging camera, not too much exciting there, but it's reportedly full frame and it's based off the A7S Mark III. The rumor suggests that it can do 4K60 and even 4K120 and naturally being a Sony, it will come with Sony's exceptional autofocus as well. All of those features in a really small portable, vloggy style setup, quite an interesting addition to that lineup. The video announcement is set to premiere on the 29th at 3pm. That's London GMT time, so I've linked that down below if you fancy checking that for yourself. Now really quickly, let me just take a moment to thank this video's sponsor, Squarespace.

Obviously, Blackmagic are a huge part of the film industry these days. So I find it quite interesting to hear about which films are being edited or graded in DaVinci Resolve, as well as using some of the other Blackmagic gear. Now, all of this information is directly from Blackmagic's website. I've linked that down below. Go and have a look. There's more information over there. But to the shortened version, the bit I was interested in, the following Oscar-nominated movies were color graded in DaVinci Resolve Studio, Babylon, Argentina 1985, the Banshees of Ineshurin, the Batman, Black Panther Wakanda Forever, Elvis, the Whale, Top Gun Maverick, plus some others, including everything everywhere all at once. Now, keeping with everything everywhere all at once, this really isn't new news, but I find it really interesting. Firstly, if you've not seen it, go see it. It's really, really cool. I really enjoyed it. I thought it was really fun and really well put together. But one of the key elements of the film are, of course, the visual effects and a big mysterious bagel. Now, all of the visual effects within the film weren't done by a giant high-end visual effects team like you'd kind of expect. It was all done by a team of just seven people. Five people did most of the work, apparently, but seven people have been credited. That's over 500 visual effects shots done by just seven people, which is crazy. There's actually a really interesting breakdown video by Wired. It's been up for a while, but I've linked it down below. You should go check that out. It's really cool to see some of the creative imaginative ways they did that visual effects. And one of the coolest details is about that aforementioned bagel, although it was actually a donut and it was modeled in Blender, one of the same Blender doughnuts that the Blender guru has taught millions and millions of people to make. Ben Brewer, who's part of the visual effects team, said thousands of people have made this same donut with pink frosting. You model it, you light it. It's how you get the basics. I decided to just turn the icing off of the donut that I'd modelled and make it black. Basically, they made one of the key visual effects elements of the film from watching the Blender guru on YouTube show you how to make a donut. That I think is really, really cool. Stuff that you use and learn on YouTube can be utilized within a million dollar blockbuster movie with a bit of creativity. And I just think that's really, really awesome. Maybe one day some of the really simple effects that we do on this channel could be scaled up and utilized in a totally different way in a movie with some creative thinking. How cool is that? And on that note, that ends the video. If you've got any news, make sure to send it over to me, news at MrAlexTech.com. Thanks ever so much for watching. Take it easy. I'll catch you next time. See ya.
