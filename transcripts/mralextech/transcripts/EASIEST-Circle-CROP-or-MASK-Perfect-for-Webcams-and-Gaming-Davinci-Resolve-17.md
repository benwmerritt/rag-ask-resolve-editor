What up folks it's Alex here don't mind me I'm just being an absolute drift king in Forza Horizon 5 and yes I am actually playing this live as I do this introduction so if it all goes wrong that'll be why. Now in this video I'm going to show you how to do this real simple circle sort of webcam mask cutout in DaVinci Resolve it's I think the quickest easiest fastest method of doing this exact thing. Now you do need to be on DaVinci Resolve 17 to make this work don't worry if you're not on 17 there are other methods that you can do this is just a super quick easy method that I found which I wanted to share with all of you still going look at this absolute beast of a drift. Right let's open up DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you exactly how to do it. So here we are in DaVinci Resolve and we're currently on the edit tab all I've done so far is I put my webcam footage on this track here track video number two and then if I just disable that you can see I've got my gameplay footage underneath so you just need to make sure your webcam footage is on top then all you need to do open up the effects library top left hand corner come on down to the open effects area and then scroll right down until you get to this area here resolve effects transform within there there's an effect simply called transform grab that and drop that onto your webcam camera footage it'll look like nothing's happened but don't worry give the footage a click on the timeline so it's highlighted in red open up the inspector top right hand corner and then click on the little effects area within here you should see transform if you don't see all of these options simply click the word transform so that that pops down like so ignore the top ones for now just come on down until you see this edge rounding and then just drag that slider all the way to the right and then it will just put your webcam footage in this nice little circle perfect then we just need to put it in the right place so just above there you've got position x y zoom and rotate use these sliders just to move this to the left or to the right to get it in the right position so i'm just going to put mine over here and then we'll move it up a little bit and then we'll maybe zoom out a bit get it a bit smaller and we'll get it roughly in the right place like so now if you need to move your subject around if your face isn't in the right place that's really easy as well still within the inspector just hop back over to the video tab and then within here you use your zoom position rotation as you usually would but it'll just affect the image within the circle rather than affecting the circle itself so I can just zoom that in get that perfect where I want it and then hit play and we've got something that looks like that now just to really finish it off what I also like to do scroll up within the effects area until you get to the stylized area and there's one in here called drop shadow simply drop that onto your webcam footage as well it puts a real subtle little drop shadow just on your webcam which just helps to make it pop separating it from your gameplay footage and job done
