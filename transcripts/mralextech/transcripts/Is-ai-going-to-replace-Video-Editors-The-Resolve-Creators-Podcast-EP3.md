## Transcript
I have a dog on me so I'm unable to clap. Yeah. Hello, hello, hello and welcome to Episode 3 of the Resolve Creators podcast. Welcome, welcome to the Resolve Creators podcast. It's from that movie about the dinosaurs. Star Wars? Yes. And yeah, what we're talking about this week? We're going to be talking a little bit about AI. Oh yeah. This is kind of a hot topic. It's such a hot topic that I want to go to the mall and dress up in emo clothes. Is that what you do when there's a hot topic? Yeah. You know that store, the hot topic? Is that a thing? I do not. Okay, so in America there's a store called Hot Topic and it's where you go when you don't like your parents. That reference went completely over my head. I was like, why would you go to the mall? Why would you do that? Why would you dress? Yeah, this doesn't make any sense. No, I was a hot topic kid in high school. You know, it's like, you know, Spencer's gifts is, you know what that is? No. Okay, so it's just like the gag store. It's like you go there to, you know, get a mug that has a wiener on it and all that stuff. It's like that kind of thing. It's like that, but like the goth emo version. That's where you get, get shirts for bands and stuff like that. Talking of that, actually. So just before the podcast, we were, we obviously were going to be talking about AI and I sent a video of Casey, which was a video of Casey, but made with AI. And as I was searching for that image, I found your Pinterest profile, Mr. Faris. Really? Yes. And there's a very moody picture. I'll always start with you like creeping on me. I got to do some research on you too. Okay, so tell me what you found. It's a very, very moody picture of a very young Casey Faris long hair looking wistfully off into the distance. Yes. Yeah. It's beautiful. That was, that was me. That was me. I used to have very long hair. I was very into, I still am, I guess, into metal music and, you know, emo music and stuff like that. And this is at my first job, taking a break from doing After Effects work to stare out the window and take a picture with the built in Mac camera. What were you looking at? That's the question. I don't know. I was trying to be moody. I was looking at nothing. I didn't want to look right at the camera because I thought that was too cool, you know? Yeah. Mom doesn't understand me, you know? So that's why I look off the side of the camera. I think we all went through that phase, especially people of our age. I might still be in that phase. Everyone was into the karang phase or the music and whatever else. Yeah. I'm perpetually in a emo phase. That's okay. I've just mixed that with dad style and so now I wear sneakers. D-mo. Yeah. I mean, it's nice to have that secret side where you're like, the kids have gone to bed, I'm going to listen to some funeral for a friend. There you go. Yeah. So what's been going on before we get into the meeting? The meeting to veg of the topic. How things, yeah, what is that? That's probably not a thing. Is that a wiener thing too? It does sound like a wiener thing, but it's not meant to. You can refer to the male area as meeting to veg, but it's just a saying of like a British male is always meeting to veg. When you get into the thick of it, meeting to veg. You have to make it about a penis. Okay. Some news. We went to a local film festival the other day and it's a 72 hour film festival. You have 72 hours to make the film and they give you a prompt and you have to have a certain line of dialogue and a certain prop. And the winner of the visual effects, the visual effects were quite good in this film, but the entire film was about penises, like a mission impossible, but he was trying to get this thing that like hurt everybody's penis. Like this is this really, really weird, weird video and our company was sponsoring the prize and we had to pick this film because they were really good visual effects, but it's like dude, really, that's what you used. Like that's what you did. Anyway, so yes, there's a lot of that unfortunately in the world. I'm intrigued now. I kind of want to watch this and see. No one should watch it. No one should watch that. Did you see it was mildly unrelated, but kind of topical. There was a trailer came out for a film called a movie coming out called Bad CDI Gator. It's called Bad CDI Gator. Yeah, and it's a horror film. Well, like a spoof horror film. Let's go. And they've just literally got a stock 3D model of this Gator and they've made a film around it. Dude, what a great idea. Yeah, they just fully went, it sucks. We know it sucks. We don't have the budget to make it better. So we're going to make it the whole point. Yeah, this is what it is. Honestly, it looks great. See, I'm going to watch that right after Slaughterhouse. You've seen Slaughterhouse? No. It's like a slasher film, but with slots. Oh, yes. I did that to my list. Yeah, that's really something. Did you ever watch, did you end up watching Cocaine Bear? No, I always fancied it though. It always looked quite amusing. It was fun and genuinely a bad movie. But sometimes that's kind of what you want. You want a movie that's just exactly what it says it is. It's dumb and you laugh and you enjoy it with some friends. As long as that's what it's for. Anyway. We should do a whole episode on our favorite movies. Absolutely. Because that would not be at all related to Vintage Resolve, but it'd be super fun. Yep, we should totally do that. Let us know if that's what you want. The people's choice awards here. Well, let's get to it. We've waffled about in just as much as the audience can take, I'd say. Is that good? You didn't have a good British saying for that last bit, did you? You're like, waffled as much as... Waffled as much as the... What's a British word for people? The blokes. Oh, yeah, blokes. Waffled about as much as the blokes can take. Yeah, we've had a bloody nut, we have. So let's talk about AI then. The AI-ness. Watch your opinion. Let's start on the broadest possible question I could possibly ask. AI, do you like it? Is it pretty neat? It's such a loaded question. Okay, my opinion on AI is that it is a very, very good tool and used well. I think there are some amazing, amazing things. Very excited for that. I think within certain bounds, using AI is going to just revolutionize the world. I mean, it has to. It's going that way. I think that anybody who's threatened by AI, feeling like they're going to be out of a job, might be partially right, but also, dude, you are more than just what you work on. You are more than the things that you create. So it's not going to replace you. It might make the things that you do easier if you're willing to learn and actually be open-minded to it. Yeah, you can understand why people are nervous about AI swooping in and taking jobs. In certain areas, I think it's going to be more prevalent than others. But you're right. I don't think it's going to replace the human element of things. And video editing, I think, is a really good example of it, because you're never going to be able to replicate what a person can do. You're never going to be able to replicate someone's opinion and the way they cut things and the story they're trying to tell. But if you can speed up part of that process using AI, like, sorry, Darren, but like some of the color grading or some of the bits like that, where you can just go, make this look like this. And AI goes, there you go. And even if it's just a base, something for you to start with, and then the human element takes over and tweaks it, it speeds up that process, doesn't it? Magic Mask is a really good example within DaVinci Resolve. The human still needs to say, I want this bit cut out because I'm doing some road scoping and some compositing or whatever. And then that really boring, arduous bit, which we used to have to do, the machines do. And they go, there you go. I'll cut it out for you. I'm so excited about that. I mean, the repetitive stuff, the stuff that's maybe less creative. Dude, why not I automate that, right? Yeah. I mean, I think that's so cool. Because you're still having the idea and you're still being the creative director. You've got all these little computer minions that go and do the work. Yeah. I mean, that's just smart. And I mean, and you can make that analogy with any kind of tool, right? It's like, oh, well, the printing press. It's like, well, then people that write things are going to be out of a job. It's like, no, they're not. This is just a different tool for a different kind of medium. And handwritten stuff is still a thing, but it's different nowadays, right? And same thing with a hand-painted, surreal painting of a celebrity in a certain context. That is going to have its place and it's going to look different than the way AI does it. That type of painting that can be easily reproduced by AI might not be as popular and you might need to learn to paint something else, you know? And that's okay. But yeah, I don't know. It's pretty weird to think about the future of AI. Yeah, it's a strange time to be in. I've had a lot of fun using mid-journey, which is the text to image thing. And I've used it in my thumbnails, for example. I've just been like, I need a bit of a background. I want it to be jazzy and blue and it just goes and does it. The generative fill in Photoshop is really good. It's just like, cut this thing out and change it into a horse and it does it. And they go, cool. And I have a horse in my family photo, which for no reason whatsoever. Needs more horses. Yeah, I mean, how much of the stuff in Resolve G use? Oh, I use Magic Mask all the time. I use Realight quite a bit. Yes, because you did the really good day-to-night tutorial. I remember that one. Yeah, yeah. So I use that and then there's other AI stuff. I use the auto subtitles for every video. Oh yeah, subtitles, stuff. Oh yeah. I used to just upload my videos to YouTube and I'd let YouTube do the stuff. But Resolve is so quick to do it and I found it to be more accurate. So I will just generate the last thing I do, generate the subtitles, upload them to YouTube and then they're good to go. And generally speaking, it understands me pretty well, even with my accent. But then really annoyingly, it always gets the word, NORAL wrong. So when I'm talking about the NORAL engine and being like, these subtitles are really good. They use the NORAL engine. It always gets the word NORAL wrong. Well, that's because you're saying it weird. Now I've said it like five times in a row. I'm overthinking how to say it. How do you say it? NURAL. NORAL. NURAL. NURAL. Yeah. Like with a U. NURAL. NURAL is a weird word. ROAD. NURAL. It's just my English. Dude, I don't know. I can't talk at all. That's the thing with being a tutorial person. It's frustrating how bad at talking I am sometimes. But it's edited and so most people don't know. Poor editor Spencer has to go through so much of me just trying to just get a point across. Yeah. That's sweet, man. Poor man. We neither of us can talk well. Let's start a podcast. Let's do a podcast. We make podcasts good because we talk good. We should have called it the gooddest podcast. The goodest podcast of resolve ever. What about you? You have the AI subtitles. What other AI things? Same as you. Magic Mask is my big one. Very rarely use them for their actual purpose of color grading. I don't think anyone does. Everyone just goes, cut me out and put me somewhere because it's more fun. It's actually more useful for compositing and all that sort of stuff, I think. For sure. Then the auto subtitles. I don't really have a huge need, generally speaking, for the Sky replacement or the depth maps. I like the transcripts. I like the idea of the transcripts and cutting out the blank spaces is quite good. You just dump everything in and you get rid of the blanks and then off you go. But even then, I don't find myself using it particularly often. Again, they're all nice things to have and they can just get you into a better position much quicker. What do you think is missing or what do you think would be next for Resolve? Is there anything you'd like to see? Is there anything you'd like to say? AI, do this for me, please. I think being able to generate textures, generate backgrounds, that kind of thing within Resolve would be amazing. I know, I'm pretty sure Premiere has something like that going on where they can generate something. Think about how cool it would be in the Fusion page, shift space, generate, and then it's like, what do you want to make? And then picture of a horse or whatever, hit enter, and then it saves it in your cache directory or something, or some media file, some file. And then there it is, and you have it on your system. Yeah, it makes a whole lot of sense, doesn't it? I really like the idea of some of the stuff that Adobe are actually doing. They have a bit of a step up in the direction they're going, I think. So they're doing things like fonts and effects with titles. You can make me a lava title and it will go and generate one with all sorts of lava effects on it and all that sort of stuff. I don't think that's available yet, but they're working on that sort of thing. Yeah, that's pretty wild. The generative stuff I think is just so interesting. And especially if they can figure out, and I haven't looked at this for a while, but I know it's kind of been a big thing of copyright infringement and using copyrighted material for models and stuff. And if they can figure that part out to where everybody feels good about it, that would be just next level. I do think this is where I'm going to get a lot of stick for this. So obviously Adobe have a subscription model. The subscription model with AI makes a lot of sense. So some of the examples they've shown of, like, I'm cutting a video together because I'm talking about the local traffic system. Give me a load of stock footage. And then you go and then cut it to the beat of this song. And because it's all subscription, the AI can do the work, you're already paying for the stock footage and the music. It just dumps on the timeline to give you a rough place to start. And then you go from there. Like, that makes a whole lot of sense. Sure. Yeah, that would be really great. Yeah, like, even if the first thing you do when you're creating your timeline, you just give a description of what you're making. And it goes, oh, this music might be helpful and this stock footage might be good. And here's a few LUTs from our collection, which maybe fit the tone of the thing you're going to make. Yeah. And I think that, to me, would be the real benefit of AI rather than, you know, making the thing. It just gives you the stuff that you're likely going to need. That's interesting to think about. It's almost like it makes it not even a template, but it gives you the assets you need, you know? Yeah, like a little video editing butler. Yeah, pre-fills the assets. You know what would be great is if, like, AI could go in and... And we're almost there, actually. But, like, if it could go in and completely organize your footage, sync all of the audio, and do all of, like, the assistant editor stuff for you, you know, put it out in a timeline, and then, like, highlight things that seem interesting, like, that could be really cool. I know, like, GoPro has something sort of like that where it will kind of cut things together that it thinks are interesting. It will literally give you the entire hour of recording, but also go, these are the key highlights, the things you might like. Yeah, yeah. But then what happens to all of the assistant editors? Yeah. That's always the two in the fro, isn't it? It's always the, that would be really cool. Poor Tony now doesn't have quite as much to do. But at the same time, like, I don't know, I might get some hate for this. If you have a skill that can be done just as well with AI, then I feel like you probably need to learn some more stuff, like, or, you know, be, I mean, if it's literally can do it exactly how you can, then there needs to be something to differentiate yourself, right? Because if you're just doing it based on, because, like, that's what AI does is based on what most things look like, right? What's common thing that people like? And if that's like your main skill is making things that look sort of like everybody else, then it's like, well, like, I understand that's kind of marketable, but at the same time, it's not like it's super unique. Yeah, I know what you're saying. You know? It's a difficult place to be, isn't it? Because I think even the people that were doing everything this kind of the same, if you really looked at it, you could go, oh, no, they are different. You know, they are a little bit different. So everyone, I think you just need to, like you said, you need to dial up your own spiciness. Everyone adds their own bit of something, and it would just be a case of dialing that up. But it may just be the case that they go, OK, we don't need people doing that boring job anymore. Here's a more creative role for you to do. That's what I would like to do. Do a more interesting job, you know? And get yourself someone who does your job and all of that. It's not the proper thing to be doing. You're getting yourself lots of weird things and you're getting involved where you just have that Ni ans goal coming. You're not playing with Sausage, yay, hi, hey. So, you didn't ever get my balls to do that. Magic Mask. I'll post like a green screen tutorial and be like this how you do green screen and like the top comment will be something like Why do we do this when we can just use Magic Mask? And it's like okay. Well first of all Magic Mask can't do it this well like it doesn't look good every time and Even if it could it's not even if it could do it this well during this one thing It's not going to consistently be that well like it's not going to consistently look so good And so you're going to have to know the essentials of it to kind of fix problems, right? So I mean I mean the fact that it's go ahead I was gonna say it's like that analogy Magic Mask is so much heavier So like it's it's not doing a good of a job and it's using All of your resources is heating your entire house because your PCs running at 400% Because that's what it needs to do whereas the old green screen is really simple. Yeah, it's green. No, it's not green. Yes Yeah, it's super simple. And so I mean there have been you know, I have like roto tutorials and and things like that and When you do rotoscoping guess what like Magic Mask works for a lot of stuff, but not everything And so guess what you still have to rotoscope stuff Even though that tools there and I use Magic Mask on 80% of things now But there's still 20% that would not work would not look good if I didn't know how to actually do real rotoscoping, you know So there's this like thought that if you have AI that you don't need the skills The AI is using and that's not true. No, I mean the the perfect situation and this is kind of a call out to black magic Give us the mask That's the thing I want with Magic Mask You know you run a Magic Mask and then you can see all the points and all the mask and go with that bit is wrong So I'll go and manually do that bit myself I'll go and do the rotoscoping and move the mask and do the stuff my problem with Magic Mask at the moment is you As you say 80% of the time 9% of time it works really really well You don't have to do anything with it when it does go wrong It's kind of a nightmare because you can't tweak it that tiny bit Where's the perfect half and half would be Use Magic Mask but actually give us the stuff so then we can go and tweak it so you want like a tweakable polygon mask Yeah, literally like you want to mask and we can go. Yeah. Yeah, so we can go to like frame 20 and go Well, it slips off there So I'll just manually move it for those couple of frames and then at that point Let's have the AI takes over and goes oh, I see what I missed because you've just pointed out on these three frames I'll replicate that over the rest of the timeline. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be cool My my guess is that it's it's thinking about that in a different way that isn't like a polygon mask It's more of a oh, yeah more of a key kind of thing Making a mat which you know, you can fix a mat With like Matt Matt controls and stuff like that But yeah, it's not as easy as just be like oh, yeah, I should just delete this keyframe I'm sure he's doing more in the background, but that'd be the the perfect that'd be great. Yeah, I think that's like the next iteration of something like magic mask is having that That that tweakable polygon actual mask, you know, but I I do think that's the that's where it's going to be the best It's speeding up those slow processes not the the generative AI You know as I say, I really like mid-journey just but I just use it because it's funny and you can really fun stuff. Yeah, I Actually, I'll have to send you the photo. I'll put it on the video version of this podcast I put a picture of me and Becky on it and I was like do us in a Pixar style Yeah, and it did me looking like the guy from up with the big glasses and it turned back into a slug No, it's not to have oh wow, that's really weird. Yeah, I didn't ask for it And it I sent it to Bex and she was like, why am I a slug? No reason I Found it hilarious. She was not so amazing You can't imagine why that's really weird But there is another service we'll talk about which Last week, I think it was they come up with a new version which is runway Okay, runway is that generative AI like the text to image like mid-journey but for videos It is available for a free trial. Okay, you can go and sign up and just try it if you want to and Yeah, it's interesting. It's it's very clever. It's obviously moving forward It's very janky at the moment, but you literally say Make me a video of a guy on horse and it will just go and think you know do something and it will give you It comes out in like four seconds chunks. So it'll give you like four seconds of some random video. I'm I'm excited I would love to Create one of these videos. This is interesting. I'm just checking it out right now. So you can start with text You literally you can look okay. Hang on a minute. Give me cuz I'm logged in Okay, would you like to see a video up? I want to see a Bear eating a kayak On the moon that's what I want There we go. Okay. Okay, so the the prompts totally ignored a few things great. You're not on the moon awesome And the bear is not eating a kayak. Okay, but he's in a kayak Okay, this is the bear Like Yeah, it looks like one of those weird motion photos Yeah, there's just a real unnatural mess to it. Oh, it's freaky But you know he paddling he out there He's doing his thing. He's he's trying his best You can I so I'll put this on screen as well I put in this image of Casey and his good friend Dan and just said make this into a video and it turned it into just a creepy 4-second horror movie. Hey, this is really troubling what you've done here It's like It's freaky how good it is, but it's also so bad. Yeah, there's you know that uncanny valley It's taking you and Dan and I know you both Personally, I've met you and just puts a real unnatural weird sheen on you. Yeah, it's really not okay You look like you should be in either some sort of commercial maybe for a dentist place or something. Yeah, I immediately go Elon Musk Which anyway, I don't know what Dan's doing with his mouth It's troubling it's troubling the conclusion AI's gotta be cool for some stuff the video the video generation long way off Yeah, probably so What's interesting to me is the the Adobe Firefly stuff Yeah, generative fill that kind of thing Because if you guys haven't seen it, I mean there's this yeah, that's a guy with a tie and they essentially just Trace around his his chest that doesn't have a tie type in tie and hit generate and it makes a tie and Then it tracks it to the footage and I mean it would just it would be really a lot of work to To make that yourself You'd really struggle to make that look good with conventional tools. Yeah, and that's just that's pretty crazy So I'm excited to see things like that where it's just like, you know, you can do just a little tweak and Even if if you were to gonna do the entire video yet would be uncanny valley kind of really strange looking But if you're just tweaking a part of it or just adding a little bit, that's like the spice that you honestly you still need Some artistic thought to do how do you fell on the the ethical side of it? So rather than just the the ethical side of people may lose jobs and that sort of thing What about the ethical side of here's a video of a person in a situation and actually they weren't there or Everything about that is a lie And I guess we kind of there already because you can do all that stuff with CGI But I guess with this it's kind of bringing it to the masses Anyone can open a DaVinci Resolve or Premiere Pro and go change the background and maybe look like I was on holiday when I was Actually just sat in my house. Yeah kind of thing Which I guess I guess you could do that anyway with green screens now. I don't know maybe there isn't anything What do you think I don't know okay? So my first thought is I wonder how much this kind of thing is gonna have to you know For something like let's say to be on the news or to be really considered in the future It's gonna have to have some kind of like digital Signature or something on it to where everybody understands that like this is this has not been edited, you know and maybe it's something with like What is it the web 3.0 thing the distributed Computing you know what I'm talking about yeah, yeah vaguely like Basically, everybody has a copy of this of the original video and so you know if you change it, right? And I would imagine that it it's gonna get to that point to where when you have something that's you know Newsworthy or or somebody thinks there might be some AI messing with it that That in itself kind of prevents that you know, there's kind of checks and balances there Yeah, I mean I'd assume as You know with looking at history It's gonna take something to go a bit wrong before someone then put something in place I'm someone's gonna Someone's gonna hit the news and everyone's gonna panic and they go haha I made this and then people are gonna go we need to stop this from happening. Yeah. Yeah Yeah, I think there's a lot of really good things about AI and I'm really excited for The creativity that's gonna unlock you know and the annoying things that's going to animate you know Yeah, it's really think you're using a wise outside of video editing finish on a slightly off topic So I use chat GBT. Yeah an awful lot I'm a big fan of that actually and I didn't think I would be chat. He's pretty cool What do you use it for generally just baseline stuff, you know like if I need a contract knocking up for something I'll be like generate this really quickly. Give me something to work off. Yeah, if I'm generating scripts It's always like we're saying earlier actually it's it's getting you started is why I really like it because I'm I Struggle to get projects started for example, but as soon as I get the ball rolling It's much easier for me to just go I'm in this now Full steam ahead and we chat gpsf and go write me a script I'm thinking of doing a script and this is what it's gonna be about and it will dump out a pretty horrible script for me Yeah, I would never read but I go cool. I have something now and I find it much easier to just Essentially rewrite it and make it into one of my own things, but it just gives me that baseline gives me that starting point Yeah, so I use it for all sorts of stuff like that getting rid of that blank page that starting point I think is so helpful for for creative stuff. So that's that's great, man Love that. Yeah, it's much easier to edit something bad Yes, right from blank. Yep. Yeah AI Might be alright. We'll see see Not very good at bears. Let's just end The one takeaway from this episode if if you want to use AI for a bear on the moon Why not be able to do it? Well, no time will tell Time will tell We have such an informative podcast Yes, we do. Hey, if you if you enjoyed this podcast if you enjoyed this content Well, why don't you send Alex an email and let him know send me an email podcast at mralextake.com. Oh dang And it's happening. I shall make sure I make that email address before this goes live. You should absolutely do that And all feedback all everything is most certainly welcome. Yep. Cuz even if it sucks no secret We don't really know what we're doing. Yeah, that's right, but hopefully this has been helpful and encouraging for you and you know You person just sitting there in the comfort of your house just listening on your phone as you do dishes or when you're out jogging You know driving in your car. I See you that person that one person eating a cookie. We know it's you. Yeah, and you should have sent us a bite Next podcast we're gonna be talking about planning content planning your content whether it's a big project or whether it's YouTube videos and all that sort of Fun stuff. So if you've got any questions around planning content for me and Casey Let us know put them in the comments put them in our YouTube channels email me at the podcast email address I'm just about to create and let us know your questions your thoughts and anything else Yeah podcast at mralextake.com that is the place to go send all of your boom your questions there about Planning content we want to hear from you That'd be awesome. And that's all that's all you got to do now. We're gonna end the podcast. We love you. Bye
