1000 fonts for free? Yes, that's not clickbait. You really can download over 1000 fonts completely for free right now and the license for both personal and commercial use. So let me show you how. But first, what up folks? My name's Alex, this is MrAlexTech and of course today we're talking fonts. So if you already know what you're doing, you know how to install fonts and all that sort of stuff, all you need to do is to go to fonts.google.com, browse all of the fonts from there, click on the one you want, download it and install it and you can start using it completely for free right now. So what are you waiting for? Go to fonts.google.com or if you're lazy, you don't even type it in, I've put a link down in the description below, you can give that a click to take you right there and you can start downloading some fonts. Now if that was useful, give me a thumbs up before you go and any comments down below. Now for those that have never installed fonts and all that sort of stuff before, hold fire because what I've done is put together a quick video showing you how the website works, go through a few little details and showing you how to download and install the fonts onto a Windows machine. Now I am of course using Windows 10, so my guide is for Windows 10. I don't have access to a Linux machine or a Mac so I can't show you on there unfortunately, but if you're using Windows 10 and you're a little bit confused about how to do it, stick around because I'm going to show you how right now. So here I am in my web browser, I'm using Google Chrome, we're just going to go to fonts.google.com. Now there is also a link down in the description below so you can give that a click rather than enter it manually if you want to and you'll be taken to this screen here. So let me talk you through it really quickly. At the top left here you can search so if you know the name of the font you're looking for you can enter it in there. You've got this box here it says type something. As you can see it's giving us a example paragraph but if you wanted to say something else you can do so. So I thought I, I missed Alex Tech. You can change the size over on the right, you can also sort by categories, language and then font properties and then down here you can sort by trending most popular newest and name. Cool and as you can see there's 109 different font families for you to download completely for free which if you ask me is pretty amazing. So what we need to do scroll down you've got all of these different fonts you can just have a look for the one that you want and then you can download it directly from here. So we're going to have a look at this top one here which is just called Roboto. We're going to give it a click and it takes us to this screen and again let me walk you through it really quickly. You've got the name at the top and who designed it many thanks Christian Robertson and then you've got these hyperlinks at the top styles, glyphs about license and pairings. So let's just scroll down at the top here you can see styles. So this one font is called Roboto but there's lots of different variations of that one font. So there's a thin 100 version, a thin 100 italic version, light 300, 400, 500, 700, black 900 etc. It's all the same font there's just different versions of it. Down here these are the glyphs. Now the glyphs are just the individual symbols that you're downloading so all the individual letters, numbers, punctuation whatever it may be. This is an about section if you want to have a little look at that you can do and then importantly there's the license. So you can see here you can use them freely in your products and projects, print or digital, commercial or otherwise. It's really worth having a quick look at the license just to make sure that you can use the font for your intended purpose. And then handily at the bottom of the screen you've got popular pairings with Roboto. So it's telling me here that open sans is often paired with this font and it gives you an example. So the heading here is Roboto and this text here is open sans. So it just gives you an idea that's another one which works well so then you can go and have a look at that and maybe download both if you need them. It's also telling me that not so sans works well as does Lato. To actually download the font, dead easy. At the top here you've got download family. So I'm just going to give that a click and in the bottom left hand corner I'm using chrome so you can see it's downloaded Roboto.zip. Now that should have downloaded to your downloads folder the easiest way to get into that from here just click on this little arrow and then click on show in folder. And here it is and as you can see it's a dot zip file which is a compressed folder we just need to unzip. So all you need to do right click on the folder click on extract all a window like this will appear just asking for the location it should be set to the same place it's just going to download I can click on extract that will create a standard Roboto folder which I can double click to open up and within here you can see all of these individual true type font files. So to install them dead easy give it a double click this open type window will appear and it will give you a quick overview of the font and then you can just click on install up in the top left and that's it you can just close that and that font is now been installed. However I've got a whole bunch of different fonts here and I don't want to individually have to click on them all and then install them. There's a quick way that you can install all of the fonts in one go. So again I'm using windows unfortunately I don't know an alternative for Mac so you may have to look on YouTube or on Google for those suggestions but all I'm going to do I'm going to come down to my windows icon in the bottom left hand corner I'm going to right click my mouse to open this menu and then we're just going to go to settings. When the windows settings appear you've got this find a setting box at the top just type in font and then click on font settings. Now at the top of this font settings box you can see here it says add fonts and you can drag and drop to install. So all I'm going to do and move this window over to the left a bit we'll grab this one move over here we're just going to highlight all of these fonts we're going to drag them into that box it will change to say copy and then we release and we get a little status bar blue bar that's just filling up and that's done it's installed all of those fonts for us and that's it you're done you can delete that Roboto folder and then continue downloading any other fonts you want to install on your system. Now of course you're going to want to use those fonts in your software whatever it may be in my case it's DaVinci Resolve all you need to do is to make sure that you restart that software so if you had it open when you installed the font just close it down and then open it up again and all your fonts should be there to use so I'm just going to add a text node on here to give you a quick example I'm going to shoot over to my font I'm going to find Roboto there it is I've got Roboto, Roboto Black, Light, Medium and Thin let's go with Black and we're just going to increase the size and there it is and that's it we've installed the font it's ready to go in all of our programs and we can do what we like with it awesome and there you go over 1000 fonts that you can start using right away hopefully you enjoyed this video hopefully it's a really useful resource for you I use it all the time it's well worth checking out loads of great stuff on there so do some digging and let me know down in the comments what you find if you did enjoy this video please give me a thumbs up if you've got any comments or feedback or anything else put it down in the comments below and if you're new here you enjoyed this video you want to see more general tech tutorials and some DaVinci Resolve videos maybe consider hitting that subscribe button thanks ever so much for watching folks take it easy I'll see you next time see you you
