What up folks, Alex here. Now if you're here purely for the tutorial, there's a timestamp below, skip to there to get to the good stuff. Now for everyone else, I suck at design unfortunately, I'm just not very good at it. Which makes creating my thumbnails or my Twitter posts or my Instagram a bit of a pain. I know I'd take a good photo, I'm just not very good with colours and fonts and making them look good. So I've started searching for a little bit of help and came across Canva. Now for those that don't know, Canva is a web based graphics design package. It's all drag and drop and it comes with a bunch of different templates, images, fonts, text designs for you to use. There is a free package is also a paid package which I'll get to in a second. I've been using it for the past few weeks. I've just messed around with it. I've made some designs for myself, for YouTube, for that sort of thing. And so far, I'm really quite impressed with it. So I figured I'd do a quick video where I'll show you all how it works. So let's first up, let's just talk about pricing. There are two options available. You've got free Canva free and then you've got Canva pro, which comes in at $12.95, which works out about 10 of your British pounds per month. If you're just looking for the tools itself, i.e. the drag and drop design software rather than the asset, then the free version is the one to go for. If you don't have your own images and you want to have access to the big back catalog that they provide, then the paid version is the one that you're going to want. There is a 30 day free trial. So I recommend that you go give that a go. If you don't like it, make sure you cancel before your 30 days are up and you've not lost anything. And if you do like it, you can keep it and see how you go. So head over to Canva.com, log in and this is a page that you'll see. Now under this create a design heading. There's a bunch of different templates, one of them being YouTube thumbnail. Now if you don't see YouTube thumbnail, just go into the search box here and type in YouTube and it'll come up with YouTube thumbnail and give that a click. And this is the area that you'll work on. And it looks very similar to any other design package. You've got your canvas in the middle and then on the left hand side, you've got a bunch of tools. Now the first one to start with is templates. So you can see here we've got a bunch of different YouTube thumbnail templates. We've got music, food, beauty, tutorials, travel. Then underneath that we've got all of the results in one big lump. So we can just scroll through and if I pick on one, let's go that one. It'll just load straight up. Now if you can actually find a template that you like under the YouTube thumbnail selection, click on home to head back to your home screen. Click on custom dimensions over on the right hand side and then just type in 1, 2, 8, 0 for 1280 by 720. So width 1280, height 720 and create a new design. Now that is the size required for the YouTube thumbnails. So this will load everything available to you in the correct size. So this won't limit you to just predefined YouTube thumbnails. It'll also open up things like brochures and templates and whatever else, but some of them are also really, really nice. So let's click on this one here. Now as you can see, it's actually a full brochure, which you'd have to go through and edit, but I really like the front page. So I'm just going to click on that and then I can edit this and job done. Now everything you see is customizable, editable. So we've got venture into the woods here. If I double click, I can edit this text. If I want to change the font, I can highlight it. You've got fonts up here. We can click and here are a list of all the included fonts. So you can just change that. We have font size. We've got the color. You can bolden, italic, justify, change the uppercase to lowercase, add lists instead if you want bullet points. And then you can also increase or decrease the spacing and the line height. If you click and drag, you can just move it around anywhere you like. And you also got the grid lines that pop up to tell you when they're in the center on the X and Y axis, which is really handy. So we can customize that. Let's just say a phone by Mr. Alex Tech. And then if you single click on the text or actually any of the elements within Canva, you get these markers on each of the corners, click and hold your mouse, drag outwards to make it larger and inwards to make it smaller. And then you just release when you're done. And then in the middle here, you can see there's this icon for rotate. Again, click your mouse, hold, move left and right to adjust the rotation. Just like anything else as well. If you make a change, you're not happy with it. Hit control and Z on your keyboard to undo. Or you can use these icons up here for undo and redo. Happy days. So we've got the overall template. We're happy with that. Next up on the left, we've got photos. So at the top, there's a search bar. You can filter by free. If you want to, you just include the free ones or you can include the premium ones as well. You've got some categories like beach, family, happy, recently used and then you've got trending. So if I just search for something here, let's say forest. So if we see an image I like, I can just click it and it'll drop it onto the canvas. If I want it as the background, if I just line the image up with the top left hand corner, I can use the markers on the corners of the image to resize. So I can just drag that, let go, click anywhere and it will automatically put that in the background for me and replace the one that's there. Or if I want to just drop an image actually on there, I can just give this one a click. Let's say I want this a bit smaller, plug it in the middle and there you go. Now if I just drag this image up here and plonk it there, you can see that it's actually over the top of my text, which in this instance, I don't want. So what you need to do is in the top right hand corner here, you've got position, give that a click, and then you've got forwards and backwards. Now you need to think of this like layers. So if I move this backwards, it'll bring the text forwards so you see the text over the image. Bring it forwards again, it comes on top. Now if you've only got a couple of layers, that's nice and easy, you can get a little bit tricky when you've got lots. You just remember you move it backwards to go behind things and forwards to bring it in front of them. Now I don't actually want that image on here, so I'm just going to hit delete to get rid of it. If you click on your image on the canvas, you'll notice you've got some additional options up in the top left hand side. So we've got filter, adjust, crop, and flip. So if I click on filter, you get a bunch of Instagram style filters, which you can just apply to your background or your image. So if I click on the blues, and it would just apply that filter. You can also adjust the intensity down to zero or up to 100. I'm going to click on none, I'll leave it as it is. You can also then click on adjust, then you've got things like brightness, contrast, saturation, tint, blur, cross process, and vignette. One I really like for backgrounds is the blur. So this background at the moment looks okay, but it's sort of detracting from our heading. So what we can do is just add a tiny little bit of blur. Let's go with about six. And you can still tell that it's a forest. You know exactly what it is. It looks good, but it's a little bit blurrier, so it doesn't detract from your heading. Crop is very simple. It just allows you to crop your image. And lastly, flip. You can flip it horizontally or vertically. Next up, we've got elements. So I'm going to click that. And there's a list of different elements that you can add. Now some of them are just things like gradated boxes or simple icons or cartoons, that sort of thing. There's also a search bar at the top. So I'm just going to pop in square. I'm going to grab this transparent box here, pop it up. And what I'm going to do is just shut that on there like that, resize. There you go. Just to make the heading stand out a little bit more. And that was dead easy, dead simple to do. It's not in the right place. Just click, move it along. If I'm unhappy with it, I can just click and delete. We can add as many of these different elements as we like. And then I'm going to click on text. Now this is where you can add more text if you want to. And it's done in templates again. So these are predefined templates. They use text or fonts that look good with each other, which is a Skell-i-Lac. So you can just grab one. Let's go with that one. Put it on there. And again, everything is customizable from there. It's all black, so we can actually see it. So let's make it orange. And you can just change it as you see fit. Now, if you don't actually want to use one of the predefined templates, you can just add your own text using these options on the top left. We've got add a heading, add a subheading and add a little bit of body text. You just give it a click to add it to your canvas and then edit it as you need to. Now next up on the left, we've got background. Now background is very similar but slightly different to photos. Photos, you can either add them as the background or you can use them anywhere within your image. Well, background is purely for the background image. You don't need to resize it. It will just simply replace the image in the background. Now it works in the same way that we can search the background at the top or we can look at the different headings. So we've got landscapes, recently used patterns, gradients, abstract and the same again. All you need to do is click on the one you want and it will add that image to your background. Now, while I quite like that, I do think it's a little bit distracting. So again, I'm just going to go to adjust, go to my blur, pop in a tiny bit of blur. There you go. Much better. You can also upload any of your own images. So I'm going to go to uploads. If I wanted to upload something, I could click on upload, select it from my PC, click open and jump it. Now I've already uploaded my Mr. Alex Tech logo. So I'm just click that and there he is. We'll resize him and we'll plunk him there. Next up, we've got folders. You can organize things into folders. So it's just a little bit easier for you to find. You've got photo folders and design folders. Now one of the things that's really handy, if we click on more, you've got a bunch of options here. The two we're going to focus on are pixels and pixel bay. Now, if you don't know, pixels and pixel bay are two free stock image websites. They're both very good with a huge array of images. So they're worth checking out regardless of whether you're using Canva or not. If we click on pixels, it adds pixels to the list. And now we've got a whole bunch of different images that we can use in our thumb now. They're all free and you can just add them as you need to. So this is called venture into. So let's just do jungle. Now we're here. And we'll drop the image on the top like so. But if we just resize it to take up the full screen. Now again, here's a good example. That looks a little bit distracting. We can't say our font. So I'm just going to go to adjust. I'm going to blur it. I've got to add a vignette. I'm also going to bring... There you go. You still tell it's a jungle, but it's darkened. It's blurry. And now our font is actually readable. Once you're happy, you just simply click on download. You can choose PNG, JPEG. PNG will work absolutely fine for a YouTube thumbnail. You can turn it into a transparent background PNG. This obviously won't work because we have a background, but you can leave the background blank and then export it with a transparent background. And then you simply hit download. Your design will be prepared. And then it will be downloaded into your downloads folder ready for you to upload directly as your YouTube thumbnail. So there we go. Easy as that. Definitely give it a go if you've not tried it before. Be it for YouTube thumbnails, Instagram posts or stories, Facebook invitations, posters, it's all there. And with a free trial, it's definitely worth having a look at. If this video was useful, thumbs up. If you've got any comments or feedback, pop them down below.
