What up folks, it's Alex here, MrAlexTech. In this video, I'm going to show you how to create that real simple neon sign effect with tracking in DaVinci Resolve. It's a really cool effect. It's actually surprisingly easy to do, but you will need to find yourself a neon font. The one I'm using is called Marquee Moon. It's free and you can download it from the link down in the description below. Alternatively, just shoot over to Google and type in free neon fonts and you're sure to find one. Now, all of the stock footage I use is a mixture of Artgrid and Pexsals.com. Right at the end, I use a Dirt overlay, which is also available from Artgrid, but it's not free. You do need a subscription to be able to use that. Right, with all that out of the way, let's open up DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you how to do it. Here we are. With DaVinci Resolve, we're currently on the Edit tab and I've got my timeline set up ready to go. We just need to add my footage. This is the footage we're going to use for this demonstration. There's a little bit of camera movement, so we're going to have to track it. That should give you a good demonstration of how this works. Now, I don't need 20-odd seconds of this, so I'm just going to cut it down because it makes life a little bit easier when we're in Fusion. Then we can give it a right click and we're going to open in the Fusion page. Now, once we're in Fusion here, your screen should look something like this. If you're missing this area down the bottom, the nodes, you just need to click on the nodes icon up here just to enable that. Then once you're in nodes, you can use your middle mouse button to click and drag to move this lot around so you can get it in the right place. Now, we just need to start adding some nodes to create our neon text. The first thing we're going to add is, of course, a text node. On this little bar here, just underneath your preview window, we've got this T over on the left-hand side. Just click, hold your mouse, drag that onto this line until it turns yellow and blue like so, and then release. Now, add a text node as well as a merge node. Now, this is personal preference, but what I like to do, I always grab the text node and I put it up here somewhere, and then I just have all of my other nodes working down just helps to keep them in order for me and MaxLife a little bit easier. Give the text node a click, open up the inspector in the top right-hand corner, make sure you're on the text tab, and then in the text box, just write whatever you want your neon to say. So I'm just going to put Mr. Alex Tech. Underneath that, we've got our font. Feel free to use any font you want, as mentioned in the intro. I'm using the one called Marquee Moon, so I'm just going to find that, and there it is. And then that's it. That's all I do at this point. We're going to come back and make any other amendments to the font, the color, all that sort of stuff in a moment. Now, in your preview window here, if you hold your middle mouse button down and drag, you can use it like a hand tool to move everything around. If we would just release that, if we hold control and then scroll in, we can zoom in just to get a closer look at what we're doing. And again, click and hold to move it around. So now we zoomed in, we can see what we're doing. We can start adding some additional nodes. So make sure to click on this text node down here in your node, so it's highlighted in red, and then hit control and spacebar on your keyboard. This will open the select tool box. So the first thing we want to add is a drop shadow. The drop shadow just as the effect makes it look far nicer and more realistic. So I'm just going to type in drop to find my drop shadow and then click add. Now, because we have the text node highlighted, it should have put the drop shadow on this line ready to go. If you didn't and the drop shadow is over here like this, it's not connected to the text. All you need to do, hold the shift key, grab this node, put it on this line until it changes color, release your mouse button, and then that will attach like so. Give the drop shadow a click, open up the inspector, go to the drop shadow, and then we've got strength, angle, distance, and blur. Now have a play with this until it looks how you want it. What I like to do, I bring the blur right down, just give it a tiny little bit of blur, but I still want to be able to read the text within the shadow. We can then just bring distance in, and then we can just change the angle. Now what I like to do here is I'll look for a reference. So I've got this cable at the top here, and you can see the shadow is underneath. So this is obviously being naturally lit from above. So we're just going to use that as a rough guide, and we'll change the angle. So the shadow is underneath, and we'll go with something like that. But feel free, have a play with those until you're happy. Now we just need to add some glow to give it a neon look. So give the drop shadow a click, control and space once again, so open up the select tool, and then we're going to use soft glow. So I'm just going to type in soft, and I've got this one here, soft glow. I'm going to click add, and I'll add our node. Once again, in the inspector, we've got threshold, gain, and glow size. So threshold, I generally just leave as it is. Gain will adjust the brightness. So if you go really bright, or you can bring the gain right down, I'm going to go with about one and a half, something like that. And then we've got the glow size. What I like to do is to make the glow size quite big. And that helps to just spill the light out onto the surroundings, which just makes it look a little bit more realistic, a little bit more authentic. Now it's at this point, I'll go back to my text node, and I'll change the color. So I'm just going to click within color to get my color picker, and then I can pick my color. Now generally, I like sort of faded pastel-y colors, but you can do whatever you want really. So I'm just going to go with a pastel sort of blue for this one, something like that sort of a sire. But pick whatever you want, have a play with different colors to see which works best for you and your scene. Once I'm happy, I'm going to click OK, and it's going to look something like that. So that's going to look pretty cool. Now I'm just going to zoom out so I can see everything. Now if I hit play, you can see that this obviously video moves around. So we do need to do a little bit of tracking. So come down to your nodes, click on the media in one. So that one's highlighted in red. We'll do our control and space once again to open up our select tool. And then from here, you're going to type plainr, P-L-A-N-A-R. And you want to find the plainr tracker. And then we're going to click add. That'll add the tracker here in between your media in and your merge. Give that a click. And then in the inspector, we've got a few options. Now the first thing you want to do, find the point on your timeline where you think you can get a good track. So basically, you're looking for something with lots of contrast. It doesn't really matter what area I use because it doesn't pan or it doesn't move around too much. So I can just pick anywhere I like within the timeline. Let's just go with here. And then we want to click on set. And that's going to change our reference time to 90. And then within our preview window, we want to select the things that we want to track. So I've got this sign here. It's got lots of contrast, lots of harsh edges. So I think that should give us a pretty good track. So all I'm going to do, click around it, rough as you like, just to give it a selection like so. Underneath here, we've got a few options. The only one I generally change is the tracker. I change it from point to hybrid point slash area, just because I generally get a better track. And then underneath here, we've got these options. So I want to click on this one, which is a play to the end. And what it's going to do is track this object all the way through our clip right to the very end. So we're going to hit that now. We've got our tracking markers and it's tracking done. And then we could go up to the top and hit go to go back to our reference time, which is 90. And then we're going to hit this one to track backwards to the beginning of the clip. And there we go. So that's given us a really good solid track by the looks of things. So then we just hit create, plain our transform. And that'll give us a plain our transform node. So all this is is a transform node, which contains all of that tracking data. So I'm going to give it a click, hold shift, and then just attach it to this line like so. And then if we just go up to the top, go to the beginning, we can hit play, and have a look at how well our text has been tracked. And that seems to have done a pretty solid job. On the off chance, you have some issues with your tracking, just delete that play in the transform, go back to your planar tracker, and then just try changing the motion type perspective should in theory give you the best tracking. But if it's doing something weird, try changing it to translation, translation rotation or translation, rotation and scale, and just seeing if you get better results with those. If however, you are happy with your tracking, you can then just delete your planar tracker because you don't need it anymore. And now the tracking is done, we can start messing around with the rest. I then go back to my text tool, and then we can start to put it in the right place. So I'm going to click on the layout tab. I'm going to change the center so I can just drag this over. And again, what I like to do here is I'll look for references. So I want to change the perspective a little bit so that it looks like it's actually sitting on this wall. And we've got a few references that we can use. We've got this side, we've got this line here, and we've also got this bottom bit here. So first of all, I'll change the center so it's roughly in the right place. Like so, I'll expand rotation. And then we've got x, y and z axes. So the z or the z is just the rotation. So I'm going to use this bottom line here. Let's put this down here on this line. I want to just our rotation until that looks about right. Perfect. And then we can adjust our y axis. So if it's other sort of on an angled wall or whatever you need to do, you can adjust that accordingly. I'm going to go with about that. And then we've also got x axis. So if it's slanted up or down, this one is. So I'm going to use this line for my reference. Now I'm just slanted backwards a little bit like so. And then we'll just change our center to put it where we want it. So let's just go with about there. Now if we zoom back out and hit play, that's starting to look pretty good. Now at this point, you can go back in, change your color, mess around with your drop shadow or your soft glow just to get it looking exactly as you want it. But from here, you're pretty much done. We've got our Mr. Alex tech. We've got it in the right place and it's been tracked throughout the clip. If you want to finish it off with one final touch, what I like to do, click on your plane to transform down here, hit control and space once again to open up your select tool. And then I'm just going to type in flicker to add a flicker addition. Add that. And then if we hit play, you can see everything will start flashing like so, giving it a slightly more neon look. If we give the flicker addition a click within the inspector, there's a few things that you can change in here. I like to change the flicker type from gamma to gain so it's changing the gain rather than the gamma just looks a little bit more subtle, a bit more realistic. And then we can also just change the range, how bright it is from dark to light. We can also change the speed of how quick it's flickering. And then in the flicker quality, there's a few more options that you can mess around with have a play with until we've got it looking exactly as you want it. And then if we just jump back into the edit tab and we can hit play, we've got something that looks like this. You can then do whatever you need to within here. If you need to make any amendments to it the easiest way just give it a right click, open in the fusion page, and then you back here with all of your nodes, you can make any amendments, start messing with it, do any changes that you need to do. One last thing, if we just jump back into the edit tab from here, if you give it a click, you can stabilize the footage. So this is a little bit shaky. So if I want, I can just hit stabilize. I can stabilize this footage because it's got all the tracking done, it's got our text already in there, it will track everything so we can just reduce some of that movement. And then to really finish it off, to really sell the effect, you might want to use an overlay like I did in the intro. So I'm just going to grab one of these dust ones or add it on top like so. Let's give it a bit of a zoo. And then we're going to come down to composite and change that to add. And then we'll just reduce the opacity a little bit. And there we go. We've now got this shot, which looks really quite cool. And it's as easy as that. And there you go. It's as easy as that. And I actually think it looks really, really cool, this one.
