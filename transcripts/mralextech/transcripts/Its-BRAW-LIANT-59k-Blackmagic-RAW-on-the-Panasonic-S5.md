This is it. Hang on. Ah! Ah! This is my first ever fully built up cinema style camera rig. And it's a beast. And it's awesome. Today is an exciting day. I guess I'll play with something new which I've never done before. But first I need to go to the gym. Go to the 7, mom away. Gonna smash out a workout before I do the day job. Then I'm gonna do the day job. And then this afternoon or this evening I can have a play. Right. Let's do this. Day job done at long last. So this is it. Hang on. Ah! Ah! This is my first ever fully built up, caged, rigged up, cinema style camera rig. And it's a beast. And it's awesome. And I have been able to play with that. I actually built the rig and everything last week. But I've been waiting for the firmware for the Panasonic S5, which is what I'm running. More on that in a moment. To come out which allows this thing to record in black magic raw format up to 6K. It's all updated and it's all ready to go. Hmm. So. Yeah. We have a Panasonic Lumix S5. It's a full frame hybrid style camera. Think of the Panasonic equivalent to the Sony a7 III, essentially, but with better video modes. That is paired with the Panasonic 24-105 f4 zoom lens. I wanted something with a constant aperture f4, which is just super versatile. That's not for vlogging. That's for recording other people and that sort of thing. The camera itself actually came with a kit lens, which is a 20 to 60. This little fella over here. Now this is a surprisingly good kit lens and 20 to 60 is a real nice zoom range. 20 is quite wide on full frame as you saw at the beginning of this video. Why are you not focusing Sony? My a7 III is having a nightmare today. I don't know why. As you saw at the beginning of the video, that was all recorded with the 20 to 60. It's 3.5, the aperture. So it's actually quite quick. That gives you a nice shadow depth of field. Really quite good for vlogging. Now I had no intention of buying a Panasonic S5. I'll be completely honest. I had seen them before. They'd piqued my interest. They look cool. And then all of a sudden on the Amazon Prime day deals, a ridiculous deal came up for one of these. So they're about two grand in the UK new with the kit lens. One came up on Amazon Prime day for £1400 with the kit lens and two additional batteries. So it was just a bit of a steal. I know that's still a lot of money. Don't get me wrong, but for what you're getting, that's a whole lot of camera for a reasonable, still a lot, but reasonable amount of money. Now the big thing that's sitting on top of this is a Blackmagic Video Assist 12G HDR recorder slash monitor. So these things connect to your camera. They take the feed from the camera onto the monitor, which you're probably used to seeing, but then you can also use it as a recorder. And you need that to record the Blackmagic RAW. I reached out to Blackmagic. I sent them an email. I said I've just picked up a S5. I've seen that you're releasing the Blackmagic RAW update for it using one of them. Can I borrow it for a few weeks and see what it's like? They said yes. So they've sent it to me. So I haven't actually paid for this video assist myself. I'm just borrowing it off Blackmagic to see what it's like. Obviously, to get that all rigged up, I needed to get a cage. So a couple of bits from SmallRig. It's all from SmallRig. No sponsor or anything like that. I bought it all myself. Got a nice little side handle. We've got the cage for the S5. We've got a HDMI to micro HDMI little adapter on the side. It bolts onto the frame. So you haven't got this wobbling around. I had this Samsung T5 SSD lying around. So then I also bought the adapter for that so I could attach it to the monitor and everything gets recorded directly to the SSD, which I can then just plug into my PC and edit directly off there. And while I've been able to play with it recording MP4, so I've sort of got the general gist of things, it's only today that I can go out and record Blackmagic RAW. And this is my first time ever recording Blackmagic RAW. I've experimented with it. I've downloaded some samples, but I've never done anything myself. So I don't know where I'm going to go, but we're going to go out and we're going to try and get a little bit of sample footage with this just to end this vlog. So yeah, this is a bit of a day in the life. I haven't got very long. I literally got like an hour and a half or so because then I've got to come back and do more work. Yeah, I know, which sucks, but there you go. This is what it is. So let's go out and have a play. Yee! Yee! Yee! Yee! Ah!
