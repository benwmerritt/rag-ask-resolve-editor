Why don't folks it's Alex here now whether you're thinking about buying shadow are currently waiting for activation or have already been activated Stick around because in this video we're going to go to the basics of getting shadow installed and up and running on your own windows device Number one optimize your connection Your actual connection to the internet will have a massive effect on how much enjoyment you get from shadow if everyone else is doing an Awesome job ie shadow and your internet provider that your network at home sucks You're not going to have a great time with shadow and there's no one to blame It's because your connection between your device and your router isn't up to par So try and get that sorted first if you nail that down everything else should fall into place So which connection is best? Well, ethernet is the absolute best option when using shadow if you have to use Wi-Fi go for the 5 gigahertz 2.4 gigahertz has better range, but is older crowded which could mean interference and Considerably slower than the other two Another tip if you're using Wi-Fi try and get as close to your router as you can the closer You are to the router the less interference you're going to have the more reliable your connection is going to be Number two install in the application now when you received your activation email There should have been links in there to download the applications But don't worry if you can't find them. What we need to do is head over to shadow.tech Click on the little dude in the top right corner Log in Click on apps from the menu on the left hand side and you got a list here of the shadow applications We've got windows 32 and 64 as well as macOS and Android if you're not too sure whether you're using a 32 bit or a 64 bit version of windows it's easy to find out click on file explorer or my computer Whichever you want to call it now on the left hand side You should see this PC right click and click on properties You'll see system type and it'll tell you whether you're using a 64 bit or a 32 bit operating system Once you know which version of windows you're using download the application Run the installation wizard and then the application will be installed and ready to use Number three the shadow launcher you'll get the shadow icon on your desktop as Well as shadow within your start menu if we double click to open the application And then it's going to ask you to log in log in with the same email address and password You use to log into the website the shadow launcher will be your only gateway into your shadow whenever you want to access your Shadow you'll do so from this launcher now I know the big red start button is tantalizing but don't press it just yet because a few key things We need to look at in here before you actually boot into your shadow PC number four setting your bandwidth Internet speeds are measured in megabits per second and this measurement is known as your bandwidth simply put This is the amount of data that can be sent across the internet to your device the higher the bandwidth the faster the internet and the more Data that can be received per second in the shadow launcher You'll see your bandwidth configuration shadow will attempt to set this automatically, but it can be a little inconsistent I'd recommend setting this manually to be sure once you've turned the automatic config off You'll then see the allocated bandwidth which you can now set manually the higher the number the more data will be transferred And the more data means better overall image quality But how high you can set this will depend entirely on the speed of your internet connection if you head over to your internet browser And go to google.com Simply type in speed test as one word and hit search And you'll see this box at the top of the screen if for whatever reason you don't see this internet speed test box at The top scroll down and something like speed test net or fast calm will also do the job Click run speed test and your home internet broadband speed will be tested on screen is a table to give you a rough idea Of what does that your bandwidth to for example if your download speed test showed between 30 and 35 megabits per second I'd recommend starting in shadow with about 20 you can always increase this later But it's better to start low and work your way up and start too high if you set it too low You'll just end up with image quality that isn't quite as good as it could be But your actual playing experience will be really really good if you set it too high You'll be trying to send too much information over the network The network will be able to handle it and you'll end up with a laggy unplayable infuriating mess So that pretty much covers the essentials of the launcher. So now it's time finally to hit to that big red button Now when you hit start the first thing it's going to do is search for your shadow when it's found your shadow It'll start it so start to boot it and then you'll get a notification that it's connecting to your shadow and then shortly after You should be taken into your shadow desktop All shadow devices come with Windows 10 pre-installed but the actual user setup hasn't yet been completed That's up to you So the first time you boot shadow your land on the Windows 10 setup screen now I can't show you how to do it so I don't have access to that myself, but it's dead easy It's a wizard just follow the steps through be very careful when you're selecting your language because that can be annoying to change later If you do find yourself getting stuck pop a look in the description below There's a link to a quick guide that shadow have made to help you get through it And once that's all done you'll end up on your Windows 10 desktop and you'll be ready to roll Would you're on your shadow? It's exactly the same as any other Windows 10 device boot up the internet do some web browsing install your favorite apps Maybe play some games get some work done Whatever you want to do when you're finished with your shadow What you should do is shut it down in exactly the same way as a normal PC So you click on the start icon at bottom left Click on the power button and then click on shut down if your shadow is downloading something Or you want to leave it running while you turn your computer off You could do so by doing control Windows and F to take it out full screen and then you can just close the application and That's it folks.
