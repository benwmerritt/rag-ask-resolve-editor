What up, folks? It's Alex here. I hope you are well, and I hope you've been enjoying the new transitions pack. Now, this isn't a tutorial. Please don't try and follow along because I do skip over things and I talk about things a little bit quicker than usual, but I just wanted to sort of empty out my brain, show you the thought process, to show you how I came about making these transitions because they're not made in the normal way. They all use expressions, there's no key frames, so they're a little bit different, and I figured some of you may be interested in seeing how they work. Now, I say some of you, because I do mean some of you, a lot of you won't care about this. This video won't be for you because it won't be a real simple, this is what we're making, and this is how you do it. It's a bit longer, and I haven't really cut it down into a nice condensed format like I usually do. Now, before we get into it, just want to let you know, I'm not a fusion or an expressions expert, really. So there may be better ways of doing these things. If you are a fusion expert yourself, please feel free to let me know down in the comments below if I can be doing things any better. Now, also, in a moment, I'm going to show you these different expressions. I'm going to talk about the easing in and out. I haven't actually made my expressions available to you just yet. I will do, I just need to finish them all first. I've done a fair chunk of them, I need to finish the rest, and then they'll be going up on my website probably, and you can just hop on, grab them for yourself, and use them to do whatever you want to do. Now, that probably doesn't make sense without watching the video, but once you've watched the video, what I'm saying will make more sense. Anyway, with all that out the way, make sure you've got a drink or something to keep you occupied. Let's open Resolve and have a look, shall we? So here we are, intervention Resolve, or on the Edit tab as usual. So we're just going to open up my effects library, video transitions, come down to the fusion transitions, and I'm going to grab this cross-Dissolve. It's just a standard one which exists within 16.2. We're going to shove that on there like so, and if we hit play, it's a real simple, just dissolve transition between the two clips. We can lengthen it, we can shorten it, and it will just do the exact same thing like so. So actually have a look under the hood, right click, open infusion page, and it looks something like this. It's very similar to any other thing that you've worked on infusion. You've got a meteor in, you've got your nose in the middle, and then you've got a meteor out, but you've also got a meteor in two. Meteor in one is your first clip, so that's of the hotel from the ground up. Meteor in two, that's my, that's this one you're seeing here. This is the hotel office building from higher up. And we've got a cross-Dissolve, that's a group at the minute, so I'm just going to right click and group that, and you can see this is really simple. You've got two bits of meteor coming into a dissolve, and it should dissolve in between two. But what's interesting is how this works. So it's not actually key-framed. It's using a little tool they've added called the resolve parameter. So if we just right click on this, you can see it's there, because I've got ability to remove it, so I'm just going to remove that. And now, as you can see, it's doing nothing. It's stuck at where it left it, which is 0.6. So I'm going to right click, modify with resolve parameter. And all the resolve parameter does is it means that the very beginning, that's at zero, and at the very end, it's going to be one. Very similar to the expression which I talked about in a previous video recently. So that's cool, it's really handy, and you can basically do that on any of the attributes in any of the nodes within Fusion. So I found this and started having a play, so I thought, oh, what else can you do with it? So let me just grab a transform and I'll put it down here. So all of these things, generally, you can right click, modify with resolve parameter. And anything that goes from zero to one, that's perfect. But it starts to become a little bit different when you want to do more than just zero to one. So let me use angle, for example. If we modify that with resolve parameter, it just does zero to one, but one degrees isn't really that useful, because you can barely see it's not much of a transition. Now, you can amend that, you can play with the parameters of the resolve parameter by clicking on modifiers, and you've got the scale, and you've got the offset. So you can add delays, and you can increase the scale. If I just increase this by, let's do 90, now you can see in the angle it goes from zero to 90, we've just multiplied it by 90. I get it, it's handy, it's a nice, easy way to work, modify with and then change the modifiers, but I wanted to know if there's an expression to do it, just that little bit easier, I could save them all in a note pad and just dump them in, it just does the same thing, but it's the way I like to work. Time, divided by comp.brender, end. Which is identical, it's doing the exact same thing, it's just a zero to a one. But I just found it to be a little bit easier, so I can put that in brackets, because we want that in brackets. I keep getting told off, they're not brackets, are they? Whatever they're actually called, I apologize to you coders that know what they're actually called, I call them brackets, I think brackets make sense to most, so I'm gonna keep calling that, but I apologize to you guys, who I'm really, really annoying by calling them brackets. We can almost put that by 360, and now we've got a consistent 360 degree spin, which always starts at the very start of the transition, it ends at the very end of the transition. And I can just copy that, save it in a note pad, I've got a cheat sheet of all these different expressions, I can dump them in and job done. Now that may not be the way everyone likes to work, but it just sort of works for me if I hit play, job done, it's nice and handy. So if we go back to edit now, I'll hit play. There we go, we've got this simple spin, 360 degree transition, but the problem with it is it just looks bland, it just looks a bit rubbish, and the main reason it looks rubbish is because there's no easing or speed ramping or whatever you wanna call it, there's no acceleration, there's no momentum. So that's when I really started to go down this rabbit hole. I wondered if there's a mathematical equation to do what we've done, a naught to one timer, but with a curve, so with easing, with acceleration or with momentum. So I started digging around, and the simple answer is yes, it's called the PEN-A easing functions. So this is what they look like, there's a whole bunch of them, we've got Cine, Quad, Cubic, Quart, Quint, Expo, Cirque, Back, Elastic and Bounce. Now, if you see this little faded line here, that's linear, that's just going from zero to one at a linear speed, and all the balls are representing the different types of acceleration curve that you can use. So then I started looking at the math, and the math is really quite complicated. You have to input four values, the time, the duration from a naught to one, B is the start point, usually zero, C is the change, and then D is the total duration. So it started to seem a bit complicated, and I've lost my way with it a little bit. And then I stumbled across this guy's article, Josh on Design, Improved Easing Functions, and he takes the PEN-A's functions that is written and just makes it a little bit simpler and easier to understand. So I definitely recommend reading this article if you're interested. And then I found this website, easings.net, and it's got all of those PEN-A's easings on display here. We've got In's, Out's and In-N-Out's. Now, if I click on Cubic, Cubic's the easiest one to start with, I'm gonna do a simple ease in cubic. Scroll down to the bottom. You've got the maths function here, but this takes all the durations and stuff out of it, and just says if you've got a variable, which is zero to one, so if you've got a zero to one time, then this is the maths you need to create this acceleration curve, which is perfect, exactly what I want. And this cubic one's dead easy to do a acceleration in an ease in. It's X, which is our zero to one, X multiplied by X multiplied by X, or X to the power of three. So let's just put that into result. Now I'm gonna put it on here because it's just a little bit easier to visualize initially. So this is just the linear. This is a time over comp.renderend. So this starts at zero, ends at one, and moves at a linear pace. So in the middle, it's exactly 0.5, the quarter of the way in, it's 2.5, 7.5, et cetera. It's moving at a consistent linear speed. So if we just come into this second one here, and I'm gonna do what was advised, which is time divided by comp.renderend. We're gonna multiply that by the same thing. Oh, no, not that. I'm gonna multiply that by the same thing again. And it enter. And now it starts at zero, it ends at one. But if you have a look, the quarter of the way in, it's at 0.009, it's not even hit 0.1 yet. Halfway in, it's just hitting 0.1, three quarters of the way in, it's only at 0.4, but then it accelerates really quick at the end to get to our one. So we have this acceleration curve. Now, writing it like that, it's a bit of a pain, so what you can actually just do is time divided by comp.renderend to the power of three. And it's doing the exact same thing like so. So let's just copy that. We're gonna head back into our fusion transition, and we wanna multiply it by 360 because we're doing this 360-degree spin. So let's just paste that in there. We'll wrap that up as well, like so. So now if we hit play, it starts off slow, and then speeds up. So we've got this acceleration to it, which starts to look a little bit better. Now this is just an ease in, it's not an in and out, so it actually looks jank at the end because it's still gaining speed by the time it stops. So let's head back to the easing, and we'll grab the ease in and out cubic, which looks something like this. Now I'm not gonna explain all the maths in this because I've got them written down in here. We've got cubic, ease, in and out, just gonna copy that, and we'll use that one instead. So just within here, paste that, and here we go. So now as you can see, it starts off slow, accelerates in the middle, and then slows down again. So we've got a real nice, consistent, easing, in and out, animation, transition, which is completely scalable, doesn't matter how long or short you make the transition, it's always gonna essentially do the same thing. Now there's lots of different ones, as I say, there's all these different ones which you can just convert into expressions. So let's just take another one, one of my favorites, it's really long, so again, I'm not gonna explain the maths. I couldn't explain the maths, I've just taken pre-existing maths, and turned it into an expression, so don't ask me to explain why this is this and this is this, because I don't know, if I'm entirely honest with you. We'll copy this one, go to transform, let's just start again, because that's confusing. We want that, all supplied by 360, done. So if we hit play, it goes that way, flips it around and comes in like so. So as you can see, we've got this animation, it's got weight to it, it looks really good, it flips one way, zips around the other, carries that momentum and then settles at the end. And again, all I've done is copied the pre-existing expression and dumped it into the expression on here, multiplied by 360. This just becomes really simple, really easy. You can have a cheat sheet with all these different expressions on, you just choose sort of the look, the easing that you want, paste it into an expression, multiply it by the value, whatever you need it, and job done. Then pretty much anyone can make these transitions themselves. Now the thing that you lose is that real creative side. So the best to people, the people that are really good at making these transitions, they'll time it all perfectly using the curves and they'll accelerate and decelerate in the perfect spots and they make really nice, professional looking transitions. So you lose that creativity side, but what you get is a real nice, consistent, really quick, really easy to make way of creating these transitions. Let me give you another example. Let's get rid of this one. Let's use one of my whips, which I've made. Would you use your whip left? We'll open this up and I'll show you how easy this was to create. So we've got our media two, media one, we've got transform node, we've got a merge and we've got directional blur. Now every single one of these is made using expressions. There's no key frame at all. So the blur, this is a one that I created. All it does is it goes up in a curve, two one, hangs on one for a moment or two and then whips back down to zero. Easy, two seconds to do, because I've got the expression saved, I can just dump it in there. So this is the first clip. We want this to start up 0.5 and move over to minus 0.5. I want it to move one out of the way. So let's grab my expressions. Let's just use this one because I've got it saved and copied, this is an out and in. We're gonna right click on center, we're gonna do an expression. Now because there's two points to this one, it looks like this, we're gonna leave the Y as it is because we're not doing any up and down. All we do is 0.5 minus, popping our expression there because we're doing a minus one. Hit enter and now that starts there, it'll flick over to the right and then flick over to the left like so. Now the next one, that's just sat in the middle, it's not doing anything at the minute, we just need to do the same thing. So an expression. This one we want to start at 1.5 because we want it to start over on the right-hand side here and then move over at the same speed, so we can do minus, pace our expression, hit enter, and now we've got this. So whips over to the right, whips to the left, done. Hit play, easy peasy. And because it's mathematic, it's consistent, it won't change, it won't ever, in theory, go wrong. Looks good because we've got this acceleration curve to it. And there you go. Congratulations, round of applause to you if you made it this far. That really does take some perseverance to listen to me waffle for that amount of time. So thank you, well done to you. Hopefully you did enjoy the video though. If you did, thumbs up.
