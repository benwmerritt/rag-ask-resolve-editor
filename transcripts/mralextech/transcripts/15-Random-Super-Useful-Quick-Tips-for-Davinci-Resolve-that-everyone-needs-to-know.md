15 random but useful quick tricks for DaVinci Resolve, mostly on the edit page. Let me know down below how many of these you already knew. But first, 20 seconds from this video sponsor, ScanProVideo. ScanProVideo is one of the UK's leading providers of equipment for professional video productions. Need a DaVinci Resolve license? They got em. What about Nvidia Studio laptop? Yep, they're out of the place. What about a drone? Yeah, they've got those too. If you need, ScanProVideo has you covered. Plus, excellent customer service and next day delivery. So click the link down in the description below to go see for yourself. Right, let's take a deep breath, open DaVinci Resolve and take a look. Starting off with importing folders into DaVinci Resolve. If you grab a folder outside of DaVinci Resolve and then drag over here to the left hand side of the media port and release, it will not only import the footage but it will also replicate the folder structure with bins. Sticking with the media pool, if you right click on the master bin at the very top and then go to open as new window, the media pool will open as a separate dedicated window which you can move around wherever you like. You can even put this onto a separate monitor, meaning you can close the media pool, giving you more room to work with. If you're a colorist, if you go to workspace, video scopes and then on, you can enable the video scopes as a separate window as well and again put them onto a separate monitor if you need to. Make any transition look better by simply clicking it on your timeline, opening up the inspector, going to the transition tab and then change the ease from none to in and out. If in doubt, in and out. I wanted this on a t-shirt but my wife said that was inappropriate. When you've applied your if in doubt, in and out, simply right click the transition on the timeline and create a new transition preset. Give it a name and then click on OK. That will save that transition preset to the effects library, video transitions and now you should see a new user area with your new transition within there and it will have all of your customizations saved. You can duplicate anything on the timeline by simply holding alt, clicking and dragging. That includes transitions, clips, audio, PNGs, anything. If you need to lower an audio track in a particular section like a music track for example but you can't be asked to keyframe it, simply make a cut, lower the volume of the second section by clicking and dragging in the line. It is there, it's just hard to see. Then within the effects library, go to audio transitions, grab a crossfade and pop it on the edit point like so. Now the music will fade down at that edit point. You can make the fade longer if required, even move the edit point or wherever you want on the timeline. You probably already know that if you open up some media from the media pool, you can then use the I and the O keys to mark ins and outs to select a particular part of that clip and then add just that bit onto your timeline. But did you know the same thing applies on the deliver page. If you only want to render part of the project, you simply mark ins and outs, add to the render queue and it will just render that particular section. To clear your ins and outs, it's alt and X. Jumping onto the cut page in the top right hand corner here, you can really quickly select between ultra HD, full HD, portrait and square timeline resolutions. There's also safe zones over here. So if you want to see what it's going to look like as a square, you can simply give that a click and it'll give you markers on your preview window like so. Back on the edit page now and Smart Bins and Power Bins have moved. To enable them, click on these three little dots and the option to show Smart Bins and show Power Bins is now within here. I highly recommend that you enable both. Once you've enabled the Smart Bins, click on DaVinci Resolve top left, preferences, go to user, editing and then enable the Smart Bin for timelines option and then click save. Now within your Smart Bins, you'll have a timelines folder and it will automatically scan all of your folders for the timelines and put them here so they're easy to access. You never need to dig around looking for your timelines. Sticking with timelines, you can really quickly jump between all of the timelines within your current project by clicking on this little drop down at the top of your preview window and then select the timeline as required. Jumping back into DaVinci Resolve, preferences, user, editing, there's general settings within here. From here, you can set the standard generator duration. That's the length of things like solid color, the standard transition duration and the standard still duration. Still duration is particularly useful if you're importing loads of images for a slideshow. Each of the tracks on your timeline has a few additional options. You can click the pad lock to lock a track. That means nothing can be moved or edited but it will still be included within the rendered video. You have disable video track that will disable the track entirely or you have the auto track selector. If I don't select any track and then do a control B for example to cut, it's going to cut through everything on the timeline. If we untick the auto track selector for this video track one, then do the same thing. Everything will be cut with the exception of those that don't have the auto track selector. Audio tracks have two additional options. The S means solo so that's the only track which we'll be playing and then M is for mute. If you have a mouse with a middle scroll wheel, hover your mouse over the preview window and then you can scroll in and out. If you click it in, you can move the preview window around. If you've completely bugged it up and you want to get it back to the default, simply click Z on your keyboard. And last but not least, a bonus tip number 16. Don't forget to like and subscribe for more Five Minute Fridays. That counts. That's a tip. I'm taking it. Bye.
