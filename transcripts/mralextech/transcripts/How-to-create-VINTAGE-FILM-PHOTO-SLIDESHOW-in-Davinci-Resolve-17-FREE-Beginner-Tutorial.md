Old school style slide projector effect in the free version of DaVinci Resolve. Now you can do this for both photos and videos, but we're gonna focus mainly on photos for this demonstration. The sound effect I'm using is available for free. I've linked that down in the description below. Right, let's open Resolve and take a look. So here we are on the edit page of DaVinci Resolve and this is the timeline that we're going to create. Now I'm gonna create a new timeline because there's a few little tricks that I want to show you. I'm gonna open up my media pool and then I'm gonna right click in any empty space and go to timelines, create a new timeline, or I can just hit the keyboard shortcut of control and N. Now before you do anything in here, untick this use project settings, go to format and then there's this missed match resolution. Make sure to change that to scale full frame with crop. Set your resolution, your timeline, all that stuff that you usually would and then we're gonna hit create. Now the reason I've done that, let me just close my inspector. I'll show you very quickly. If I open up this image here, you can see that it's a portrait image. So we've got black bars on the left and right sides. But because we've changed that mismatched resolution, we've changed the scaling, if I drag that and put it on my timeline, it will automatically zoom in to stretch to fit. So if you've got portrait images as well as landscape images, you don't need to constantly be trying to zoom them in to make them fit, it'll automatically do it for you. You may then just need to change the positioning. So I'll just give that a click, open up the inspector, go to my positioning here and change the position, but at least you're only changing the position rather than changing the zoom for all of those different images. Next up, at this point, before you really get into it, try and figure out what length you want your images to be. So how long each image is gonna be on screen for your slideshow. I'm gonna go with about four seconds, but play around, figure out what works for you. And then there's a real quick way of making sure that each of your images is that length. So I'm actually just gonna delete this one from my timeline. I'm gonna shoot into DaVinci Resolve, top left-hand corner. We're gonna come to preferences, and then gonna jump over to the user tab. And then I'm gonna come down to editing on the left. And under these general settings, there's a standard still duration. Make sure that seconds is ticked rather than frames, you want seconds. And then you can just enter that number in there. So as mentioned, I'm gonna go with four seconds, but if you wanted to, you put two, six, seven, whatever you want in there. And then we're gonna click Save. Now I'm gonna go to my media pool. I've got a bunch of images here. So I'm just gonna highlight them all, and then click and drag onto my timeline. And because we set to that default still duration, all of them will automatically be exactly four seconds in length. So much easier way than dragging them onto the timeline and then adjusting them from there. So we've got a timeline. Now we can start to have some fun and create our old school slide effect. Now you're gonna want to use an adjustment clip for this. So I'm gonna open up my effects library. We're gonna come on down to the effects area here, and then grab an adjustment clip, drag it on my timeline above all of my images, like so. Now I'm just gonna lengthen this out. So it covers the entire sort of slideshow area, like so. And we're actually gonna click and drag up one track. So we want this to be on video track number three. You'll see why a little bit later. So now we've got our adjustment clip. We just need to add our effect. So still within the effects library, click on open effects, scroll right down, until you get to this resolve effects texture area. And you want this one here, it's called film damage. Give that a click, drag it and drop it onto your adjustment clip. So it's given us a sort of a sapier yellowish hue. We've also got this little scratch line, and there's little bits of dirt jumping around as well. Now if you want to change that, give the adjustment clip a click, so it's highlighted in red, open up the inspector, click on the effects tab, and within there you've got film damage. And there's loads of options in here. So first of all we've got film blur. So it automatically blurs it a little bit. We've got our temperature shift, so we can make it blue, or we can make it really sort of orangey. We're gonna go with something like that. And then we've got tint. So this is green on the left and pink on the right. I'm gonna reset that just by double clicking tint shift. Put it back to what it was. We've then got a vignette, so we can play with vignette. I wouldn't worry about that just yet, so we're gonna come back to that shortly. And then we've got dirt. So there's all these little bits of dirt popping around. You can change the density of them. You can change the size, the blur, and then the seed just, the seed basically just changes where that dirt appears. Now by default, it'll be jumping around like this, which you probably wouldn't get on an old school slide projector. So we can actually just turn that off by unticking the changing dirt. And then we just get some static dirt, which I think looks better for this sort of effect. Keep scrolling down. Then we've got scratch. So that's this little scratch line here. Again, it's dying around, moving back and forth. If you like that, keep it. But if you want it to stop moving, you just tick this moving scratch, then tick that and it'll become static. And then you can change the position. You can change the width, the strength, and the blur. You can even change the color. If you don't want that line at all, just untick this enable to get rid of it. If you keep scrolling down, you can add up to five scratches. So if you want a few more, you can just go, we'll have this one, move it around, do whatever you want, have some fun until you've got that looking exactly as you want it. So we've got our old school sort of CPA tone. We've got our scratches and our dirt. Now we just need to have that black sort of border. And again, nice quick way of doing this. Still within your effects library, you can see here I've got my film damage. So in the text area, scroll up a little bit until you see Vignette. Grab the Vignette and drop that onto the adjustment clip. And your Vignette will appear like so. In the inspector effects, you've probably see film damage like this. Just click on the word film damage, not the little switch to the left of it, just film damage. And I'll minimize that. And then you'll see the Vignette underneath. Give Vignette a click to expand the options within there. Change the operating mode from basic to advanced, and then change the border shape from oval to rectangle. Then scroll down and you've got softness here. Just bring that all the way to the left. And as you can see now, we've got our black border and it's just making this look much more like a slide. We can then go up a little bit and change the size. So we can amend that as needs be. We could rotate it if we really wanted to. We could change the anamorphism, which is basically how wide you want this to be. Down here you've got color. So if we give that a click, you can make it a different color Vignette if you really wanted to. I'm gonna leave it as it is. Now we just need to add a little slide transitions. And to do this, we're gonna use a solid color. So still within your effects library, open up the generators, and then down here you've got solid color. Grab that and put it on this video track number two. Remember we moved the adjustment clip up, but that's why it's to make room for our transitions. Now if you give your solid color a click and then hit ctrl and D on your keyboard, or you can right click and then just go to change clip duration, you can change the length. Now I've been playing around with this about a second or a half seems to work really well. But again, have a play with this and see what works for you. I'm gonna go with one second and 10. So I just click change. What you want to do is put this solid color directly over this edit point here. So it's slap bang in the middle there like so. Now what I also like to do, give the solid color a click. In the inspector video generator, you've got this little color block here. Give that color a click and then you can change the color of the solid color. What I like to do just to bring the brightness up a little bit, just something like that. So it's very faint, but you can just sort of see the square in between slides, like a projector is shining on like a black wall, that sort of thing. I'll go with something like that, click on okay, but that is entirely up to you. Now a quick tip for you here, give the solid color a click with your playhead right in the middle, just hit N on your keyboard and it'll put a little marker right in the middle and that just makes life a little bit easier later on. You'll see why shortly. So now we've got this solid color. It's not gonna do anything. It's literally just gonna cut to black at the moment. So we just need to animate this and we're gonna do that using a video transition. So again, effects library, go to video transitions and you wanna scroll down until you get to the white area and you wanna grab an edge wipe and drag that onto your solid color like so and then adjust the length. So it meets perfectly in the middle like so. Now we've got this. That's just wiping up. Give that wipe a click so it's highlighted in red. Open up the inspector, go to the transitions tab and then you've got all your options within here. So what I tend to do, change the ease from non to in and out. That just gives it this nice little S curve which gives it a little bit of acceleration which makes it look better. Then I'm gonna give it a bit of a border but I don't want the white border. I actually want it to be feathered. So we give it a little bit of a border and then take the feather box. It just softens that edge a little bit and then we just need to change the angle. So I want mine to come over from the right and whip over to the left. So I'm gonna go to my angle, drag over to the left and it needs to be minus 90 like so. And then if we hit play, we've got this nice little wipe effect like so. Now we want to do the same thing but wiping back the other way to reveal our second clip. So the easiest way to do that, give the transition a click so it's highlighted in red, hold the alt key on your keyboard, drag over and then release and you'll have the exact same transition duplicated over here. We can then just lengthen this out to meet right in the middle. And now we've got this, which works, you may want to keep that effect or what I like to do, give this second transition a click on the timeline, change it from minus 90 to just 90 and now we've got this. So it wipes in and then wipes back, which looks just like an old slide projector would. Now the great thing about this, we've done that once, we can just duplicate it all the way across our timeline. So if you've got a really long slide show, it won't take you long to add all of these transitions. Give the solid color a click again, so it's highlighted in red, hold down the alt key and then just drag. And because we added that marker in the middle, it should automatically snap into place like so. Now what we can do, I've got quite a few here. So I'm going to zoom out a little bit and I can highlight the two, hold alt, drag it across, it'll snap into place. This time I'm going to highlight all four, hold alt, click, drag and it'll snap into place and we've done all of those in no time at all. You can just keep doing this, creating as many of these transitions as you need to in no time at all. Now if you want to zoom the whole thing out so that it's a little bit smaller in the frame, what you need to do is just use another adjustment clip. So I'm going to scroll up, I'm going to go back to my effects, I'm going to grab my adjustment clip, I'm going to put it over the top, so I'm going to create another track, we've got a video track four here, we'll lengthen this out, so it's the same length as our slideshow. Give this top adjustment clip a click. In the inspector, I can just adjust the zoom to get it looking something like that so it's right in the middle of the frame. Then we just need to apply our sound effect, which if you've used the one I downloaded, it's just in here, I can drag this on here. We'll line this up, you'll probably need to cut them. So you just need to cut this file up so that all of the actual sound effects tally with your slides. But I'm going to go with something like that, and then if we just hit play. Now if you're happy with that, you're good to go, you can just export this. But if you want to jazz it up just a little bit more, there's a few little tips that I like. You can add a dynamic zoom to this adjustment clip, so I'm just going to toggle that on. And then we just get this sort of zoom going on within the actual photos. It just adds a little bit of additional movement. Within the open effects area of the effects library, scroll down just a little bit until you get to this resolve effects light. And you want to grab the glow and drop that on the adjustment clip. And it just gives it this nice little glow, which again, just helps us sell this old sort of worn film style effect. To change the settings, click on the adjustment clip. So it's highlighted, inspector effects. You've got your film damage once again. You can either click on film damage, or just scroll down, you've got glow here. Give that a click. And there's loads of options to mess around with the actual glow settings within here. Just tweak them until you're happy with it. And then lastly, just scroll up a little bit if you're still within the effects library. You want to get to this area, the resolve effects color. And within there, there's an effect called flicker addition. Give that a click, drop that again on your adjustment clip. And then you'll get this little flicker effect. If you want to change that flicker effect, just go to the adjustment clip, the effects area, scroll down until you see your flicker addition. And then you can just change the speed, change the range, do all that sort of stuff that you need to do to get it looking exactly as you want it. And there you go. Easiest that old school slide projector effect in DaVinci Resolve.
