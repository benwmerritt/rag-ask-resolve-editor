What up folks Alex here and welcome to Five Minute Friday. Now when you were initially installed DaVinci Resolve, providing you didn't skip the initial wizard, it would have actually asked you what keyboard shortcuts you wanna use. The standard DaVinci Resolve ones, those from Final Cut or those from Premiere Pro. Now don't worry if you missed that, in this video I'm gonna show you how to assign those programs to keyboard shortcuts to your DaVinci Resolve. Now if like me you've only ever used Resolve, that's not too useful. So I'm also gonna show you how to set your own custom keyboard shortcuts, one of which is super useful and I use it all the time. So let's boot open DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you how. Now you can do this from any one of the tabs. What you're doing is, it's using straight up to the top left hand corner where you can see the words DaVinci Resolve, give that a click and then click on keyboard customization. Now the first thing you need to know is in the top right hand corner here, where it says DaVinci Resolve, you've got a little drop down arrow. Give that a click. Now DaVinci Resolve comes with these presets. So we've got DaVinci Resolve, Apple Final Cut Pro, Avid Media Composer and Adobe Premiere Pro. So these are DaVinci Resolve's interpretations of those programs shortcuts. So if you've come from Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro, you may be more familiar with their shortcuts. So these should help you feel a little bit more at home when using DaVinci Resolve. And you can just give them a click, hit save, close the window, and that will apply that template for those keyboard shortcuts to your DaVinci Resolve. But there is a little bit more to it than that. So I'm just gonna open that window back up again. Now I'm gonna show you how this pane works. So at the top here, you've got these keyboards. It's like a virtual keyboard. Now anything that's black, like all of our numbers here and control and shift and return, that means there isn't a shortcut currently assigned to that key. The ones that are gray, like A, S and D here, they do have a keyboard shortcut assigned. Now the easiest way to see what's assigned is simply hold that key down on your keyboard. So we're gonna hold the A key and you can see it will highlight and then it will show you in the application, normal edit mode is the shortcut. If I do S, toggle, slip, slide mode. Now on the left, you've also got shift, control, and alt. Now you can either hold them on your keyboard. So if I hold control, that will show you all of the shortcuts which happen when you hold the control key or you can actually click on it on the left to turn control on, alt, or all of the above. So for example, now if I hold control and then hit A, it'll show you that the control and a shortcut within the application is select all. Now if you wanna actually go through the whole list, you've got this commands table here. You've got to show all dropdown so you can choose the specific criteria assigned, unassigned, modified, or you can search for specific shortcuts as well. Or we can just go to all commands and scroll all the way through this list and have a look at what's available. And I'm just gonna show you one really useful ones which you may like to assign. So I'm gonna go to application, then I'm gonna go to edit, and then we'll find the one in this list called delete gaps. Now if you just have a quick peek at my timeline here, you can see I've got these big empty spaces between these clips. Now we could click on each of the spaces and do a ripple delete to close everything up, or I can assign this delete gaps to a shortcut. Now backspace and delete are your two primary keys which you'll use for deleting clips. So I wanna keep using those keys, but I just wanna assign something a little bit different. So I'm gonna use the shift key. If I hold that down, now shift and backspace already has something assigned, but shift and delete doesn't. So that's what I'm gonna use for my shortcut. So I'm gonna come down to this panel here, delete gaps, I'm gonna click on this empty box within the keystroke column until it turns red, and then I hold shift and then delete. And it will assign shift plus delete to that keyboard shortcut. Now you'll notice up in the top right-hand corner, the venture resolve now has an asterisk next to it. That's because something has changed. Now if I just hit save, it will ask me to give it a preset name because I can't actually overwrite these default ones, but I can create a new one. So I'm gonna call this the venture resolve Alex, and I'm gonna click on okay. Now if I close that down, I'm just gonna click within my timeline, I'm gonna hold shift and then hit delete, and it will automatically delete all the gaps and just close everything up. Now I'm just gonna go back into keyboard customizations again. Now if I click on the three little dots in the top right-hand corner, we've got some more settings. We can save as a new preset, which is the same as a Mending one and hitting save. We can import presets, we can export presets, and we can also delete presets as well.
