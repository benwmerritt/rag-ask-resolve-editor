Video within text like this one to change the background color easy put another video as the background instead We can do that too. How's about using a PNG like my logo here? We can mask with that as well You can actually use PNG's of any shape to do some really cool masking and you can do all of this masking on the edit page Really quickly and really easily in DaVinci Resolve But before we do let me just take 20 seconds of your wonderful time to thank this video's sponsor scan ProVideo. Scan ProVideo is one of the UK's leading providers of equipment for professional video production They have everything cameras, lenses, audio equipment, lighting, stands, monitors and everything in between They're also registered resellers of Blackmagic so you can get your DaVinci Resolve licenses as well as Blackmagic panels Cameras keyboards and whatever else so click the link down in the description below to check out scan ProVideo cool Let's open up DaVinci Resolve jump on to the edit page and take a look So let's start off with the video within title to get us going So the first thing you need to do open up the effects library top left Come down to titles and then grab literally any title from here It can even be fusion titles or custom titles whatever I'm just going to grab the standard text title and pop it on our timeline like so Let's lengthen that out a little bit like this and then we'll give it a click So it's highlighted in red on the timeline and then open up the inspector top right hand corner Video title and then we can just customize the title to be whatever we want it to be So I'm just going to put Alex within there and let's make it nice and big And we could also change the font if we wanted to let's go with something like that now something obvious But I want to make this point we can see here the text is white and the background is black But this background isn't really black. It's just empty space. There's nothing there The only thing that's actually on screen really at the moment are these letters a l e and x and that's key to what we're doing So the next step we need to convert this into a mask So what we need to do within the inspector go to settings Scroll down until you get to this composite area Click on the composite mode drop down It will currently say normal scroll all the way down to the bottom and you want to convert this to be the alpha This is making this a mask now by default. It will look like nothing's changed at all So now we just need to do the next step which is add our video So I'm going to grab my video from the media pool and pop it on the timeline like so above our title Then we give that a click in the inspector do the same thing so inspector Video scroll down until you get to composite composite mode change this from normal This time around we need to change this to be the foreground and that's it. You're done So now we can see our video playing within our text Simple so the alpha is the cutout. That's the mask. That's our cookie cutter as it were And then the foreground is what we see within that shape Now if I click on the title on the timeline, we can just zoom this in change the position change the angle do whatever we want to do But as you can see we're changing the size of the mask not the video within the mask If we go to the video above same thing resume this in and out We're changing the size of the video within the mask But not the actual text itself if we want to move all of these two things together The easiest way to do it is just highlight them both on the timeline right click Convert this to a new compound clip. I'll call mine alex and then click create Now if we give that compound a click we can zoom this out And in Change the angle do whatever and our video will just perfectly play within our title like so So what about changing the color of the background? Well, this is simply the word alex with the video in it So if you want to change the color of the background we can move this up a track go to our generators Grab you could grab a solid color. I'm going to use a four color gradient just because it looks fancy Pop that on there And there we go. We could also do a video. So let's get rid of that gradient Grab another video and put that underneath Now we've got a video within a text on top of a video now the other cool thing about this being a compound clip If we were to go to let's go open effects and grab a drop shadow We can pop that on our compound and now our video within a text has got a drop shadow on top of a video Easy so the key to this is just remembering that alpha foreground the foreground goes on top the alpha underneath the alpha is the cut out the mask The foreground is what you see within that shape once you've got that. This is the easiest process in the world Let me just show you one other quick example So let's get rid of all this so we can start again this time. I'm going to use a logo So this is my logo here now. Remember you can't actually see it because some of it's black But my logo does exist over here the black background That's just not there at all. So this maybe helps to show exactly what's happening So let's go to the composite and this is going to be The alpha then we'll grab a video And we'll turn this video to be the foreground And tada now we're seeing the video within the shape of my logo Even though we couldn't fully see the logo before it doesn't matter because it was there And it will just appear where the logo was and ignore the background like so easy, right? Boom and that's it for this video. Thanks ever so much for watching If you enjoyed it make sure to let me know down below and stick around because we've got another Five-minute Friday same time next week. Take it easy folks.
