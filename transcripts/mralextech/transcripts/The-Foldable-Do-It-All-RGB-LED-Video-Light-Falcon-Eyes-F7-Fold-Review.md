What up folks? My name's Alex, this is MrAlexTech and today we're talking about the Fulcan Eyes F7 Fold RGB LED Light. Now if your first question is can I use it as a key light in a pinch? To answer that question, I'm currently using it now as my key light for this video. It's set to 5500K and about 60% power and I'm using the included diffuser just to soften it up a little bit. Now to be clear, Fulcan Eyes did send this to me for free to review but I have no agreement with them on under no stipulation to say anything at all so all the views and opinions are entirely my own as always. Right let's get the boring stuff up the way and we'll cover some of the key facts. The light is rated at 24 watts, producing 11,200 lux at 0.3 meters and has a CRI of 96. The white colors range from 2,500 Kelvin all the way up to 9,000 Kelvin. Plus of course there is the full RGB LEDs on there so you've got a full range of colors you can create whatever color you want. There are also some fun scene modes included and some Roscoe and Lee color filter modes. It's made pretty much entirely of metal and it comes in at 685 grams. There's actually two batteries included that are non-removable and they're rated at 3,800 milliamp each giving you a total of 7,600 milliamps. That'll give you an estimated runtime at full power of 150 minutes which I came very close to in my own testing and all the charging is done via the type C port on the device of which there are two and it's currently priced at $269 or £259. So for those familiar with the original F7 is the fold just two F7s bolted together? Yes pretty much that's what it is however they've also added some additional key features like the ability to control the speed and the power within the scene modes which you couldn't do before. Bluetooth and you can connect and use the app on your phone which I'll cover later. You can check the timestamps everything's timestamped down in the description below. Cool with all that out of the way let's have a look at what you actually get in the box. So of course you get the F7 fold itself which we'll have a look at shortly. You get this handy little carry case it's a little bit cheaper but it serves a purpose and inside you also get these two honeycomb grids. They slide onto the device and just help to direct that light a little bit more. Two type C charging cables in the box however there are no power bricks or plugs at all. You also get this ball joint arm tripod mount on each end really handy for using a cage and you get this cold shoe mount if you're looking to mount the light on top of your camera for a run and gun style solution. Now in my box I've also got the Fulcanize honeycomb nine inch foldable grid that's not in there by default there's a separate package you can buy which does have it or you can buy it separately for about 20 quid it just fits over the entire unit just helps to direct that light just that little bit more. So let's take a closer look at it shall we? Now as you can see it is of a full metal construction feels really really well put together it's built like a bit of a tank 700 grams so it's relatively hefty you're not going to have too many issues in terms of it breaking if you just throw it into a bag feels really really durable. As you can see you've got your LED panels front and back you've also got a quarter inch tripod mount on the top and bottom however one of those becomes inaccessible when you actually open the device up and then you've got all your controls over on the right hand side. Now it's held together by a really strong magnet you have to pop your finger in there really prise it apart to actually get it open. Now talking of the magnets on the back they're really strong and they can actually be really useful because you can open this thing up slap it onto a metal object and it will stay and it just makes it a little bit more convenient you can put it in places where you might not usually be able to attach a light without worrying about a tripod or a clamp or anything else. Once open as I say you do only get access to that bottom quarter inch thread so you can mount on a tripod if you want to there's not much else going on the back other than these two LED screens to monitor all of your settings all of your controls are over on the right hand side. We've simply got an on off mode button an F wheel which you can click in as well as scroll up and down a brightness wheel with hard stops at the top and at the bottom and then you've got a type c port for charging. Now as you can see all the controls are repeated for the top section and the bottom section. I would have liked to have seen an option within the device to be able to control both from one of the panels but you can unfortunately have to set everything twice you can of course set them both to be the same or you can set them independently to do their own thing. If I turn it on really simple you can skip between the different modes just pushing the power or mode button so we've got the cct mode which you can use the f scroll wheel to change the calving as I say it's from 2500 to 9000 and then you've got the brightness wheel to change the power output. If we go to the next mode we've got our hsi again we can click in the f button we can then pick either the hue the saturation and change that as we need to and then again use the brightness to change our intensity or our brightness. If we hit mode again we've got a scene mode which is very similar way we'll cover those shortly. You've also got RGB you've got your leaf filters and then you've got your Rosco filters. Now you can also see you've got your battery meter at the top again they're independent batteries so you can either use them together to get those 150 minutes but if you don't need that much power you can run them one at a time and you'll get combined 300 minutes because you'll get 150 minutes from each. Now you can still use this light when it's plugged in so you can plug it into a wall and run it off the mains and it will still work while it's plugged in and that goes for power banks as well. So let's talk about the scene mode I had loads of fun with these they're really great I put together a couple of quick skits for you to have a look at. How to become a wizard. Spell number one fire spell. Okay. Virus. And as you can see I had loads of fun with them I think they're great there's 20 in total so you've got everything from lightning to a TV set to fire engine ambulance police strobe effects party effects all sorts of really cool stuff. Now it's a little bit niche not everyone's going to be able to make use of them but if you like to tell short stories or you do skits that sort of thing it could really really handy you can replicate loads of different effects just using a single light to tell a bit of a story so if that's the sort of thing that you're after they do work really well and they're really really easy to use. So next up we've got the app which is called diesel or desal light is available for both android and iOS so let's take a look at it shall we. So here we are inside the app connection was really easy just click the plus add the device find it via your Bluetooth and then you're good to go. You can see here I'm on my recent and I've got my two individual lights so I can turn them on and off individually so if we just turn this light on we'll open up the screen first things first we've got our color panel and we can just go through and select the color we want to this is the HSI we've also got RGB we've got Lee and then we've got the Rosco filters at the top and then we can change the brightness just using the slider on the bottom if we then go to temp we can just select our temperature so we've got 2800 k we've got 4000 k you can enter the d number in here as well if you want to and then again you've got the power you just slow that down to adjust the power accordingly if we go to scene here's a list of all the different scene modes so we've got lighting screen candle flash strobe heartbeat if we just select police for example we've got a flashing police light so we can do a minus five in terms of speed which will slow it down very plus five to speed it up and again we can adjust the brightness just using the slider if we go to music you can play music and it'll sync to it and play along and then if we go to picture it pulls up the camera and we could just point this at a color we've got a color picker we can then use the color picker icon to select yellow and the light will change color to match we change that to red we get red we click on this one here we can actually take a photo and again match the color to it or we can just go through our gallery to select a photo to pick the color from as well now of course that individual lights if we go to group we can then access them as a group and it works in exactly the same way so if I just turn them on as a group both come on and then again we can just select the colors we've got the filters across the top if we just go to scene we can then turn this to candle and both will work in synchronization with each other now another quick tip I don't think vulcanize are going to thank me for this but included in the box is an allen key I think the intended purpose is for tightening the bolts within the folding mechanism if they would become loose however take two of those bolts out and you can actually separate the fold into two separate f7 lights you've got two separate lights you can put in two different locations and that becomes even more useful when you take into account the app because you can do it all from there you control the power control the scene modes the settings all from your phone without having to get them out of their location so you can put them in high places low places in lampshades behind curtains if you're filming a scene wherever you want them control it all from your phone then it becomes they're a little bit more useful now I'd have actually really liked it if vulcanized would put a quick releasing so I don't think the intended use is to actually undo it and pop them out because there's some little washes in there you need to be careful of so a quick release would have been really handy don't really know how it would work but if you have the option of attaching it together using it a single light as it really is but then a quick flick of a switch you could pop it open you've got two separate lights that would be really cool in my opinion for any future iterations however I did just want to give you a quick example show you how you can use this light when it is stuck together to create some really cool lighting I've done a quick product shot just using the one light and actually you can get some really great results here we've got an action cam setup and I'm currently lighting it from above but we're going to turn that off in a second I've got the f7 fold set up we've got the honeycomb grid on the one that set as 5500k so just basically nice even white now I've got the other one no honeycomb we've just set that one to be a nice purple that's going to be a background color so if we just turn my main light off and we're just going to use the grid with this light get it just out of shot because we've got the honeycomb on it we can just direction the light so it's lighting the front of our subject without really getting too much on the background I'm pretty happy with that and then if we just aim the other one at the back wall and we'll turn that one on looked pretty good to me we then add a slider to get a real quite nice product shot just using a single light so to conclude it's a really powerful really well-built really handy versatile little light it does a bit of everything and everything it does it does really quite well however it is quite expensive at 260 quid so you need to sort of weigh up whether you want one small light that does an awful lot of things or whether your money would be best spent elsewhere buying multiple lights to do specific jobs I personally really like the light it's small enough to just throw in my bag and I really like all the different modes that it offers it's actually done a really surprisingly good job of lighting this video it's still set off as the key light just with a diffuse one and it's been running off battery the whole time and it's doing a really great job whether it's the light for you only you can decide but hopefully this video has given you enough information so that you can make an informed decision thanks ever so much for watching if you did enjoy this video give me a thumbs up any comments or feedback pop them down below and if you're new here and you did enjoy the video maybe consider subscribing for more thanks ever so much for
