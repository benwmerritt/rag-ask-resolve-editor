translation secretly What up folks, Alex here, Mr Alex Tech and in this video I'm going to show you the quick tips and tricks that I use to create that cool 30 second TV style intro. And I've got a bit of a challenge for you all. I want to see what sort of TV style intro you guys can come up with. Now music is absolutely essential for this. Any good TV show needs an absolutely killer soundtrack. Now the music I used was called Noir and it's by Jameson Nathan Jones and it was provided by Sonata Media who just so happened to be this week's sponsor. They're the new kid on the block when it comes to royalty free music licensing for your videos. And I'm not just talking about YouTube videos but also any commercial projects as well. That goal isn't to bring you the biggest selection of music but instead to deliver a finely tuned hand picked selection of just top quality music. So they've got the cool tense cinematic music like this. Lay back fun music for your vlogs like this. Or even some silly Christmas music like this. And last but not least they're affordable coming in at under $10 per month. That's less than 8 quid for us Brits and that's for an unlimited personal plan. And best of all they're offering a 30 day free trial so you can go ahead sign up for 30 days give it a complete trial try out all the music see what you think before committing to doing anything. Also all of the footage I used in this video was stock footage. There's loads of good quality free stock footage out there. The one I recommend just head to pexels.com there's a whole range of stuff on there you can download and start using for free. I also use a gritty overlay towards the end that is also free and there's a link down in the description to that as well. Right with all that out of the way let's get started. So first things first we're going to shoot on over to sonata.media. And once you're here you can start browsing the music straight away without logging in by simply clicking on tracks at the top or if you want to start your 30 day free trial just click on the start 30 day free trial in the middle of the screen and you can sign up and get going from there. So now if we just hit tracks at the top it'll take you to the main page within sonata media and we've got a bunch of tracks shown to us straight away. We can listen to them at any point by just hitting play and they'll start playing or we've got a bunch of filters on the left hand side. Now what I like to do choose either a genre a mood or a theme and it starts to just narrow it down and to help you find the track that you're looking for. So genres we've got everything from acoustic cinematic to soul in r&b. I wanted something really cinematic for mine so I'm just going to click on cinematic and then we're also going to choose a mood do we want something aggressive epic or hopeful I wanted something tense I went for that zombie sort of feel so I'm going to click on the tense and that's just going to narrow it down to this specific selection. As I say we can just give them a click to have a listen and once we're happy we can just come on over to the right hand side click on the little license subscription and then we can download the track in either an mp3 or a wav file and job done. Now if you really stuck for ideas you don't know what to go for just browse the catalogue find the track that you really like and then work backwards from there. Once you've got the music generated the ideas will start flooding in and everything will fall into place. So here we are with the intervention resolver on the edit tab and my first quick tip is just to show you quickly how I set up my timeline and my media pool. So first things first I'm going to click on media pool top left hand corner to open my media pool here and then I like to add a couple of bins just so that I can stay organized. So underneath master on the left here just right click anywhere in the empty space click on new bin and then you can just create folders for all of your media so that you can stay organized. So I'm just going to create two first one's called music and then the second is simply footage and then I can import all of my media into the corresponding folders so I know where everything is. So I've imported everything I need the first thing I want to add to my timeline is my music because I'm going to edit to the music it makes sense just to start off with the music first. So I'm going to grab my music track just drag it down here and it's in my timeline. Now by default I've added it to audio track number one but I don't actually want to keep it on audio track one and I'll show you why. If I was to add some video which had some audio attached as soon as I was to add it to video track number one it overwrite my music because it's on audio track number one with the audio attached and that can cause you some big issues further down the line. So instead what I like to do grab your music just drag it down either to audio track two or you can go a bit further and put it onto audio three so then it's just out of the way. Now if I was to add some video with audio attached my music would be well clear out of the way and I won't accidentally overwrite anything. Now on the subject of audio if you do import some video which has audio attached and you want to get rid of it really quickly click on an empty space so that nothing is selected then holding the Alt key on your keyboard click on the audio so it's highlighted in red like so and then just hit your backspace if you're on Windows or delete key if you're on Mac just to get rid of that audio file without getting rid of the video file. Now my next thing come down to your audio track with the music on click on the name itself that will highlight and then you can just change the name of the track once again I'm going to go with music and again it just helps you to stay a little bit organized and then also what I like to do here is to just turn off this auto track selector with the auto track selector enabled if you were to just do a random cut here it'll make a cut through this video but it will also make the same cut through your music track and then if I was to delete this with the ripple delete key it would cut up my music moving everything along and making everything go out of sync so if I just undo that if we untick or disable the auto track selector if I was to make any cuts in my timeline like so it won't make the same cut onto the music file unless I specifically select it and try to make the cut on the file and then it's at this point you can just trim or make any changes to your music as you need to so I've just got a 30 second section which is what I'm going to be editing to and then we can start to add our video and here we are so as you can see I've added all of my stock footage and I've just done some basic cuts so that it lines up with my music now I am generally sticking to basic cuts but I also like to use cross dissolve transitions so I'm going to open up the effects library come down to video transitions grab a cross dissolve and we can just drag that onto the edit point to add a simple cross dissolve transition like so now throughout my intro I want to have that running theme of the time or clock so I'm just going to add some additional footage on top so I'm just going to shoot into my media pool and I'm going to grab this footage of this clock here and I'm going to put it onto my video track number two above all of my other footage and then to make it like an overlay so that you can see both pieces of footage it's really simple give it a click so it's highlighted in red open up the inspector in the top right hand corner unless it's already open and then you need to do is come down to where it says composite and then you've got composite mode give that a click there's loads of options in here feel free to play around experiment with them to see which different looks they give you but I'm just going to come down to overlay give that a click and it's going to overlay the footage over the top but you can see both like so we can then just come down to the opacity lower the opacity just to get it looking exactly as I want it you can then make any changes you can zoom in relocate it to get it exactly in the right place so now we've got the two pieces of footage playing together like so if you want to take that a step further and to do a gradient fade between the two pieces of footage that's really easy as well give it a click make sure that your playhead is over it like so and then we're going to jump into the color tab make sure that you've gotten your nodes over the right hand side just by clicking on nodes up here and then just make sure using this little timeline down here that you're on the right piece of footage so I've got this one here this little clock piece of footage selected and then within the nodes right click in any empty space and add an alpha output and that'll put this little blue circle over on the right hand side there we need to do is grab this little blue square drag it to the little blue circle like so that'll mean that anything that we mask will be transparent so you can see the footage underneath then in this little window under here we want to select the power window and then we just need to come down here and grab this one which is the gradient tool and then on the screen you've got this sort of t shape and then you can just move this wherever you want it point the arrow and you can see you can change the gradient of your footage so if you want a really obvious gradient or we can have a bit of a line we can move it as we need it so I'm going to have the left hand side showing more of the clock and the right hand side just to be our footage underneath something like that you can move it around and if we jump back into the edit tab we've got this faded footage like so at any point you can just jump back into the color tab select that footage make sure you're on the right node and then you can make any adjustments to fine tune it to get it looking exactly as you want it so now we've got our main track with any transitions we've got a second track with all of our overlays and fades we can now start to add our titles so we're going to open up the effects library we're going to come down to titles and then we're just going to grab text and add that onto our video track number three now once again I don't like to do anything fancy with this whatsoever so I'm just going to trim this down so it's the right length we'll zoom into the timeline a little bit we'll give the text a click so it's hollowed in red in the inspector we're going to go to the title tab and then we can just add our name in here so I'm just going to go with mr alex tech and then we can change the size and then just move the location wherever we want it make sure to select a nice font like so now a real great trick here is if you want some of the text to be bold in the rich text area if you just select the text that you want to be bold so I'm going to go with the alex tech make sure it's highlighted and then come down to the font face I'm going to change that to bold and it'll just affect the font which you've got selected within the rich text area and then you're going to select the mr section and we're going to change that to light and now we've got this combination of a light mister with a bold alex tech and again it's just a nice subtle detail but it really makes the text just look at that a little bit nicer back to our timeline I want the text to fade out so what we're going to do grab this little icon at the end of the text drag it to the left as far as you want it and now the text will simply fade out like so you can then just replicate this by holding alt on your keyboard clicking and dragging the text moving it over to the next section trim it make any changes you need to I'm going to add a fade in as well give it a click we'll change the name for this one to sonata media we can then just change the position so I'm going to put this one over on the right hand side we'll make the sonata bold and then media I'm going to change that to be light and there we go we've got a real nice text fading in and out with bold and not bold and it looks really good and then last but not least we're going to add a dust overlay so I've already downloaded the overlay and I've just imported it they're simple mp4 video file so you just import them as any other video we can just grab them out of the media ball and put them above our footage like so so I'm just going to drag this out it's got some audio attached I'm just going to use my alt trick to give that a click and then get rid of the audio and by default it's going to look like this it's just going to be completely black screen with the dust on screen so you can't see anything underneath that to change that again really simple give it a click open the inspector come down to the composite mode once again but this time we're just going to change it from normal to add and that will just reveal everything underneath now that's a bit strong for me so again we're just going to reduce the opacity get it looking exactly as you want it and there we go that's our real simple intro done and that's it for this one I hope you enjoyed this video and I really look forward to seeing what you guys can come up with
