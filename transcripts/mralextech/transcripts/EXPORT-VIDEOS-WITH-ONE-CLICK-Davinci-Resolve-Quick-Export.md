So here we are on the edit tab within DaVinci Resolve. My project is all done, ready to go. I'm gonna hit my keyboard shortcut, pow! Quick export's gonna open up. I've got a preset name with all my preset settings done. I'm gonna hit export, I'm gonna pick a location, I'm gonna hit save. The video is now rendering, it's exporting to the location we've just set with all of my predetermined settings. How cool is that? Right, let's go back a few steps and I'll show you exactly how I set all of that up. But before we do, hello, my name's Alex. You're watching Mr. Alex Tech and today we're looking at quick exports, obviously. So let's open DaVinci Resolve and take a look, shall we? So here we are back in DaVinci Resolve. Now, the first thing we need to do is jump over to the deliver tab. And what you need to do is to set all of your settings exactly the same as you usually would for any of your YouTube videos, for example. So I'm gonna come over to the H.264 Master, I'm gonna change my format to MP4, I'll leave my codec as it is, I'll change my encoder to my GPU. You'll only see that option there if you're using the paid studio version of DaVinci Resolve, resolution, frame rate, quality, all that sort of stuff. Just set it all to be the same as you usually would. This is how you create the preset, which you've got everything set and ready to go. All we need to do is to come up to this little icon here in the top little right hand corner of these render settings and then we're gonna save as a new preset. Give it a name, so I'll just call this new YouTube for now and we'll click on okay. And then over on the far left of this little bar here, you'll see this icon, these are all your custom presets. You can see here we've got this one called new YouTube. If I click on the little dropdown, you can see any of the presets that you've made previously. So as you can see, I've got three here, we're currently on the new YouTube. Now from here, of course, you can just add to render queue and you've got this preset saved, but we wanna set it as a quick export so it's a little bit easier. So we head back into this menu here and at the bottom you've got quick exports and you can see all of the presets are in there, but only two of them have currently got ticks next to them. So this new preset, the one we've just made, doesn't have a tick next to it, which means it's not available within the quick exports routine. So what we need to do is to give that a click so that it then has the tick next to it. So I'm gonna click new YouTube and just to double check, I'm gonna go back into the menu, quick exports, you can see it now has the tick next to it. So that's perfect, it's good to go. Then we're gonna shoot back into the edit tab. We're back in the project, it's all done, it's all ready to export so we can quick export it. So we're gonna click on file in the top left and we're gonna come down here to where it says quick export and give that a click. The quick export window will appear. You've got a bunch of options, YouTube, Vimeo, 264, on the left you've got your custom preset, you've got the preset name drop down box here and then from there you can select the preset that you want to use. So I'm gonna go to new YouTube one. It's got a few basic details here and then we've got export, so we'll give that a click. It'll then ask you where you want to save the export as well as giving it a file name at the bottom and then you just hit save to export your video. So real nice quick easy way of rendering out videos that you use the same settings for time and time again. Now there's one last step to make that even quicker and that's assigning the quick exports with keyboard shortcut. So I'm not gonna export that at the moment, just gonna cancel that and we'll cancel that one. To set the keyboard shortcut, we're gonna click on the words DaVinci Resolve in the very top left. So we're gonna open up this menu and then we're gonna go to the keyboard customization. The keyboard customization window will appear as you can see here. In this little commands list, we're just gonna expand application, go to file and then within this list scroll down until you see quick export. Now I've already got my shortcut enabled here as you can see, I'm just gonna deactivate that so you can see what it looks like. When you get to it, you'll just see this little box here under the keystroke and it's empty. Give that box a click and so it goes red like so and then you can just enter the keyboard shortcut you want to use. One that I recommend is control, alt and E. So I've hit control, alt and E. It's saved that within this quick export keystroke and then we can just hit save. That's saved, we can close that down. Now anytime we're in a project and we're ready to export, we can just control, alt and E to bring up our quick export. Make sure we select the right preset, hit export and job done and that's it. What an awesome way to export those jobs really quickly. Quick exports from the edit tab, how cool is that? I'm excited about it because I've only just recently found out about it as well. So I'm excited to start using it, it's gonna save me loads of time too. Anyway, if you enjoyed this video, if you did find it useful, please do give me a thumbs up.
