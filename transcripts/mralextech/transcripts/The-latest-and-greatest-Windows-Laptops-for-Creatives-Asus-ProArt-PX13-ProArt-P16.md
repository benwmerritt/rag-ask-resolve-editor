Asus ProArt laptops are back. These are laptops designed specifically for creators just like you and me. And I've got the two latest models right here. This one is the P16. It's your traditional premium 16 inch workhorse. And this is the PX13. It's a super portable 13 inch laptop with a 360 meaning it's a laptop, it's a 10 and it's a tablet kind of thing. Big thanks to Asus for sponsoring this video and getting these laptops to me. Both are rocking the latest AMD Ryzen AI9 CPUs with dedicated Nvidia GPUs and of course these lovely Asus Lumina OLED displays. Both of these are also only available in black. This is part of Asus's new design language for these pro art laptops and I quite like it. There's no flashy lights just a sleek nano black design featuring this clean Asus ProArt logo. Overall the coating isn't impervious to those smudges and fingerprints but overall it's not too bad. Both devices are also pretty slim and light especially considering what they're packing on the inside. The P16 tips the scales at 1.85 kilos where the PX13 is just 1.38 kilos but overall even this diddy one does feel premium and it has some solid build quality and some nice materials. Pop them open and on the inside they both have a 16 by 10 Asus Lumina OLED touchscreen display. The P16 is of course 16 inches with a 4k resolution while the PX13 is 13.3 inches with a 3k resolution. Despite the differences in size and resolution though the overall performance is very similar. They both have 500 nits of peak HDR brightness, they cover 100% of the DCI P3 colour gamut and Avisa True Black 500 certified. They both are unfortunately only 60 hertz which is a shame and I know they're not designed for gaming but a higher refresh rate would provide a nicer smoother experience whether you're web browsing or editing on the timeline. This PX13 is also designed to be flipped around and used as a tablet style device with the pen and that 60 hertz refresh rate does diminish that experience somewhat. Both hinges a good diamond screen wobble is handled pretty well especially on the PX13. The P16 does have slightly a jellier legs and just above the display you've got your usual slew of webcams microphones and IR blasters. Perfect for logging in with your face using Windows Hello or any tedious zoom calls you might have to endure. In terms of ports once again they're pretty similar. On the right hand side we've got one USB4 type C port, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 type A port. The PX13 has this micro SD card reader while the P16 swaps that out for a full size SD card reader. The power button on the PX13 is also on this side too which does take a little bit of getting used to. While on the left hand side they both have the new charging port, one HDMI 2.1 port, another USB4 type C port and a 3.5 millimeter combo audio jack which is of course located conveniently closest to the user. Hooray! And on this side the P16 also has an additional USB 3.2 Gen 2 type A port as well. Now all of those type C ports are great for external SSDs with up to 40 gigabits per second transfer speeds and of course power delivery so you can charge via type C as well or connect some external monitors and run the displays via the type C port instead. And while it's only a small thing having a type C port on both sides is really convenient. Both models also feature Wi-Fi 7 with Wi-Fi smart connect and Bluetooth 5.4. Open it up and here we have the keyboards both of which are your usual white backlit chiclet style. There's no RGB here, no flashing, no pulsing, no waving, none of that funky stuff. They are both nice to use though. The P16 is objectively the better keyboard, it's more tactile, it has less flex and the keys are a little bit less squishy and less rattly. Both are decent enough though and are easy to type on and just generally get along with. I have no real complaints about either to be honest but both do feature the teeny tiny arrow keys and have a half size enter key which I'm not a huge fan of but they do the job and it's fairly typical for these sorts of devices. There's also the new co-pilot shortcut key but these aren't co-pilot plus laptops, not at the moment anyway. There's no sign of Windows Recall so do not fear but you do get things like quick access to co-pilot and the real time transcriptions. The track pads are decent too although they're not haptic so there's not a huge amount of feedback and the one on the P16 is massive. They are both multi-touch though and they do generally work pretty well. Both laptops also feature the ASUS dial pad. A quick swipe from the top right hand corner to activate it and then you can use the dial for a bunch of different functions. It's actually quite handy for quickly adjusting the brightness or the volume without having to resort to using the function keys but it can also be figured to work in apps like Photoshop and DaVinci Resolve. You can use it to zoom in and out or use it to whip around the timeline. What about performance? I hear you cry. Well, both of these laptops feature the latest AMD Ryzen A09 HX370 processors which is a bit of a mouthful but that's 12 cores, 24 threads, running at 2GHz but capable of boosting up to 5.1. It comes packaged with the AMD Radeon 890M integrated graphics and a dedicated NPU with up to 50 tops of AI performance and overall it's a really impressive performer and that's all combined with a good chunk of RAM. The P16 is available with up to 64 gigabytes while the PX13 goes up to 32 gigabytes. Both use LPDDR5X memory running at 7500 megahertz. However, it is soldered on so there's no option for upgrading. Both laptops are also NVIDIA Studio laptops available with up to the RTX 4070 laptop GPU and both of the models I have here are equipped with that top end RTX 4070 and performance in both is surprisingly similar. There's maybe an extra percentage on the bigger P16 due to having a marginally higher TDP of 120 watts versus the 115 watts of the PX13 as well as just generally being a bit bigger so allows for more cooling and all that sort of stuff. In Cinebench 2024 we get a multi-core score of 1093 for the P16 and 1024 for the PX13. A single-core score is about 11213 for both. It fluctuates slightly but it's you know it's close enough. That puts them both pretty comparable to my MacBook M3 Pro and actually puts them both on par with the previous generation Ryzen 7700X desktop CPU as well so overall pretty As for the GPU we see 11277 for the P16 and 10844 for the PX13 which is again pretty powerful. It's a good margin more than a previous generation 3070 and almost double that of my MacBook M3 Pro. So a lot of AAA titles run really really well whether you're playing control with ray tracing on or stomping some bugs with friends in How Divers 2 both of which comfortably hit that 60 frames per second target at medium to ultra settings. You will need some DLSS when running at the native resolution of these displays or you can drop the resolution down a bit and still get some really nice crisp images. 1920x1200 or 2560x1600 are both really great options. For some actual quick gaming benchmarks first up Cyberpunk. As you can see the P16 is a little quicker across the board but the PX13 isn't far behind. Of course with the exception of the native resolution purely because the P16 has 4k versus the 3k of the PX13. 2560x1600 being the sweet spot and then for Shadow of the Tomb Raider no DLSS enabled again solid numbers hitting 60 pretty much across the board. So they are pretty capable little gaming laptops even if that's not what they're specifically designed for. These are designed as creator laptops so what are they like in DaVinci Resolve? Well magic masks run faster than real time even in 4k as do most of the other GPU accelerated features. Plus you also have access to the brand new Nvidia upscaling which again runs really well. Speed Warps will drop frames at 4k but they are generally the most taxing of the GPU accelerated features. Noise reduction is all handled quite well too but real time playback at 4k is only really possible with up to about three frames of the temporal noise reduction. Knock the timeline proxy down to half and then you can go crazy with five frames of temporal and as much spatial as you like and it will all run pretty much in real time. Now in larger projects the P16 will have the advantage when it comes to editing purely for the fact that you can spec it up with some additional RAM but they are both very capable editing laptops. 4k, 6k, H.264, 265, Blackmagic Raw, neither of these laptops will have too much issues running those. Now of course that is all plugged in and being powered by the included 200 watt charger. It actually starts to get more interesting when you unplug the device. There's an option within the MyASUS app to deactivate that Nvidia GPU entirely when running on battery which has been my preferred method. This makes them perfect for using them as silent cool notebooks for note taking, web browsing, photo editing or just general admin and everyday tasks where it still zips along quite nicely and resolve performance is still surprisingly impressive. On battery, whisper profile to keep quiet, timeline performance is still really good. This is a 4k, 265 clip on a 4k timeline without using the timeline proxy and cutting it up is still silky smooth. I can even jump onto the color page and run the magic masks at a decent frame rate. What's also interesting, this doesn't actually make use of the NPU just yet instead running on the integrated GPU. So there's probably more performance being left on the floor once resolve actually makes better use of the hardware. Starts applying some noise reduction or doing too much fusion and that sort of thing. It will start to falter but overall it's actually a pretty solid performer. Even rendering is pretty nippy and while you won't get MacBook levels of battery life doing this you will still get a good few hours so these CPUs are much more efficient than some previous generations. And as for gaming on that internal GPU here's one of my casual favorites, Dave the diver. Great game, I put loads of hours into this. It will play really comfortably at the native resolution at 60 fps running only on the integrated GPU. Even something like Lies of Pi which is admittedly really well optimized but this will run on medium settings, decent resolution, little bit of upscaling and it still hits 60 frames per second. Still looks pretty good as well. Now there's also a nice middle ground. Another benefit of these laptops becoming much more efficient is that you can get really solid performance using less powerful chargers. I like using this 100 watts type C charger by Anker and plugged in with this we can get that Nvidia GPU up and running. Now it will be limited because obviously there's not as much power but you can still get some pretty decent performance and in Resolve we get the same silky smooth timeline performance and our GPU accelerated effects do jump back up. Not quite as fast as you'd expect but still reasonably pokey. And nope the battery life didn't drain while doing these tests which all in all makes both of these laptops really quite versatile. The PX13 has space for just one SSD available out of the box with up to two terabytes where the PX16 has two slots with up to two terabytes in each. This is actually a really great setup for editing allowing you to use one SSD for the apps and the cache and the other for your media. But both are upgradable so if you've not got enough storage or they're not fast enough you can chuck in something better. But what about cooling? Well they do of course get warm during intensive tasks and the fans will obviously ramp up. Due to the form factor the PX13 does heat up quicker and feels like it's the louder device but that is expected giving how much performance is packed into such a small package. Both the models feature ASUS advanced cooling technology, the P16 has three fans while the PX13 has two and both use liquid metal to help keep those CPUs as cool as possible. Now powering the P16 is a pretty chunky 90 watt hour battery while the PX13 being a little bit smaller has a smaller battery that one is just 73 watt hours. Both include your typical 200 watt charger which will charge them up in just a few hours. As for actual battery life under heavy workloads with that Nvidia GPU you will see the battery life drop to just a few hours. Running the PCMark extended test which does a bunch of stuff opens loads of apps, web browsing, word processing, video processing, photo editing, creative workflows and gaming. Imagine an entire day shoved into 30 minute benchmark with the Nvidia GPU enabled the P16 used 20% while the PX13 used 24% of its battery. With the GPU disabled the P16 15% of its battery and the PX13 17% of its battery. Which means with a very mixed workflow including some gaming and some creative work you're likely to get somewhere between two and four hours of battery life on either device obviously with a bit more on the P16. But use it as an everyday browsing machine doing some admin and you'll easily see a solid eight hours of standard use. So while it's not revolutionary battery life it is still enough to get you through a full working day. Speakers are by Harman Kardon and while they're both decent the P16 speakers are noticeably better. They're upwards facing for starters and just have a clearer fuller bassier sound making for a much more enjoyable experience. Both are perfectly fine for some casual gaming or watching some tv or some movies but you crank up the volume with some music and the P16 does start to jump ahead. Now both of these laptops come with a slew of ASUS software included. This is the usual my asus for configuring things like the battery care options, fan options and OLED care to look after those OLED panels. There's the pro art creator hub for configuring the asus dial pad and doing some color calibration and then there's some new ones. We've got MuseTree and StoryCube. MuseTree is designed to inspire and organize your creative ideas. It helps you to generate inspiration through keyword inputs or random suggestions and map it out like a big old brainstorm. And then there's StoryCube on the other hand which is a digital asset manager. It uses AI to help you organize all of your photos and videos more efficiently. So how much is all of that gonna cost? Well the P16 starts at a little over two and a half grand but the exact model with more storage and 64 gigabytes of RAM is closer to three grand. Well the PX13 starts a little bit cheaper at two grand and goes up to two and a half. So they're not cheap but they are comparable to other Windows devices of similar performance and considerably cheaper than a similarly specced MacBook Pro. So there you have it two really powerful creator focused laptops that kind of serve two slightly different functions. You've got your more traditional 16 inch creator focused laptop in the P16 which is ideal for those looking for a desktop setup they can move from desk to desk versus the PX13 which generally feels quite fresh and incredibly portable especially considering the power inside. Yes it does have some compromises compared to the P16 but considering its portability and form factor it's a really solid performer for creatives on the go. So that pretty much covers it. Be sure to check out the links in the description for more details on both of these laptops and thank you once again to Asus for sponsoring this video. Let me know down in the comments which one of these two you'd prefer. Thanks for watching take it easy I'll catch you next time.
