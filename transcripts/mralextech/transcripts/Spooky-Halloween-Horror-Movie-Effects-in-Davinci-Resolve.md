What up folks? It's Alex here. It's Alex here. It's Alex here. And welcome to Mr. Alex Tech. This week we've got a bit of a Halloween special as you can probably tell. We're going to be taking a look at some easy, fun and cool looking Halloween tricks, effects and techniques. So let's open the Vintry Resolve and take a look shall we? So here we are in the Vintry Resolve. We're on the Edit tab. This timeline you're looking at the moment is that introduction footage. Now as you can see, there's nothing too complicated going on here. There's no fusion. It's just some simple effects, some basic cuts and overlay and an adjustment clip. So let's get into it. Now here's the footage as it comes out of the camera. It's the same lighting setup I always use except for the fact that I changed the color of the background and I lowered the height of my key light just to give me some slightly stranger shadows. So let's give it a quick color grade. I'm going to jump straight into the Color tab. Now as always with color grading, there's loads of different ways to do things. I'm not a professional colorist. This is just a quick dirty way that I achieved the look I was going for. So the first thing I wanted to do was to add loads and loads of contrast. So to do that, I'm going to use the Curves. So down on this little menu in the middle, I'm going to click on this left icon here, which is the Curves to open this box here. Now if you've never worked with Curves before, you've got this line going from bottom left to top right. Bottom left is your shadows and the top right are your highlights. So you can click at any point and move around so I can bring my shadows up or I can bring my shadows down. Same for my highlights. I can just mesh around with the curves like so. Now what I want to do is to bring my shadows down but leave my highlights exactly where they are. So to do that, I'm just going to click right in the middle to add a little point here. Then I can just bring these down. As you can see, this top half stays exactly as it is. So my highlights remain untouched but I can just bring my shadows down creating loads and loads of cool contrast. So I'm going to go with something like that. Now the next thing, that looks cool but it's too saturated for my liking so I'm just going to lower the saturation. So in the bottom left, I'm going to click on this number one and then I've got saturation here. I'm just going to reduce this until I'm happy. I'm going to go with about 30. So that's starting to look pretty cool. The next thing I want to do is just add a blue tinge to some of the shadows. So still within this bottom left area, click on this drop down. Make sure that you're on log. You've got color wheels here and then you've got shadow. If I click on this center dot, I can drag this around which just adds different colors to my shadows. So what I'm going to do, I'll just reset that and drag this over to the right just to add a blue tinge to the shadows which will contrast loads with these red lights in the background giving us a really cool look. So I'm going to go with that. Perfect. We jump back into the Edit tab. So I've taken the footage from looking like this to this with a real simple quick color grade. Next up, we're going to have a look at this crazy head movement exorcist style effect. Now this is footage in real time I'm just pulling silly faces, grimacing and moving my head around. Doesn't really look that scary. So what we need to do to make it look a little bit weirder and a little bit more horror film is to speed the footage up. So I'm going to right click on the footage on the timeline. I'm going to go to the Change Clip Speed and we're just going to change this speed at the top. I'm going to go with 500% but feel free to experiment with whatever you like. So we'll hit Change and if we go to Beginning and hit Play, there we go. So it looks much weirder, much scarier, much more like a horror film. Now there's something else you can do here to really sell this effect. So that may be good enough. I used that throughout the introduction on some clips where it's just sped up footage. But to really sell it, what we can do, open up the Effects Library, click on Open Effects, scroll down until you see this Resolve Effects Stylize area and then grab Stop Motion and apply that to your footage. Give the footage a click, open up the Inspector, go to the Open Effects tab and you'll see the Stop Motion parameters in here. Now by default, the frame repeat is set to 5. What that means is it will repeat the first frame five times and then it will move on to the sixth frame and then repeat that five times and it gives you this stop motion sort of janky slideshow sort of look which does look pretty cool. Experiment with this different frame repeat until you're happy with an effect that works for you and you could just use that footage as is. For one last thing, to really sell it, underneath there you've got this Blend Mode. If you've never used the Blend Modes before, zero means we're seeing this stop motion effect. That's all we're seeing, we're just seeing this effect being applied. If I change that to one, we're no longer seeing the stop motion, it's being 100% blended which basically means you can't see it and we're just seeing the raw footage underneath. So to get a really great effect, set that to 0.5 and you'll see you get this really cool ghosting effect because we're seeing the raw footage being played in normal and we're also seeing this stop motion effect being applied as well. If I hit play, it gives us a really cool effect with these ghosts and movement and all sorts of stuff and that's what I used in my final edit. Now of course, you could just place that footage wherever you want it on your timeline and use it as it is, like so. Or another option, put it above some other footage like I have here and then give your top footage a click, open up the inspector, you've got the opacity, just lower that and then you can blend different pieces of footage together to give a real ghostly sort of look like so. And again, that's what I used for part of the introduction. So next up is an audio effect and it's the one I used in the introduction to create these really cool little echoes. So here's some footage of me saying, what up folks? It's just in my normal voice doesn't sound all that exciting. So what we're going to do, still within the effects library, this time we're going to come down to the audio effects area and we're going to grab the echo and we're just going to drag that onto our audio like so. And then this box will appear. From the top drop down, it's currently set to default. I'm just going to change that to slow crossover. Now there are loads of other options in here and I'll be completely honest, I'm not an audio engineer. I don't understand most of them. So I'm just going to leave them as they are. But of course, feel free to experiment and see what works for you. I'm just going to close that box. And then if we hit play now, we've got an echo which pings from left to right and sounds really cool. If we want to make any adjustments to that audio effect, we can give it a click. We can open up the inspector code to audio, scroll down to echo and we've got all the options in there as well. So you can just apply this echo to add an echo to your voices. Again, just really helps to sell the spooky horror film effect. So we've got this cool flickering ghostly effect. And again, it's dead easy to do. So here I've got two pieces of footage. This first clip is just my own two room without me in it. It's really handy to take plenty of this. So you've got it to cut to and from in your edit. And the next clip is just of me looking at the camera. Now what we need to do to do that effect is we're going to come to the point where these two clips meet. We're going to grab the second clip, the one with me in it, we'll drag it up. So it's on the track above and we're just going to move it to the left. So there's a bit of an overlap. And then what we're going to do, move our playhead over to this top track. And then using the right arrow key, we can just move forward a couple of frames or a frame, whatever you want. We'll do a quick cut. We'll do a few more and we'll cut and then a few more. We'll cut again. So here we've just got four cuts. And then we can just delete using backspace, not the delete key because we want those spaces to remain. And now we've got these gaps here. And then if we hit play, real simple flicker. And then I appear and it moves straight on to the next track. Easy peasy. And then just using those basic effects, you can start to build up a timeline that looks something like this. So this part of the footage here was simply sped up. This footage here was obviously sped up just using that stop motion as well. And we've got that simple flickering effect there. And then it cuts to me. And then here we've simply adjusted the opacity so you can see this ghostly figure in the background. So it's starting to look pretty good. But there's a couple of last things we can do to really sell the effect. So first things first is to add an overlay. So the overlay I used is down in the description below. You can it's completely free. You can go and download it and use it as you wish. It's a simple JPEG image file. So all you need to do is download it and then import it into DaVinci Resolve. I've got it here. It's just labeled as to JPEG. And I can just drag that onto my timeline and put it above all of my other footage. Now, if I just move my playhead, it looks something like this at the moment, which is not ideal. So first things first, give it a click, open up the inspector. And then all we need to do first of all is just zoom in so it completely fills the frame like so. Now, because it's just black and white, there's a really easy way that we can make this transparent so you can see all the footage underneath. Give it a click. Still within the inspector, you've got this composite mode at the very top. It will be currently set to normal. Just change that to add. And then all of the black areas will go transparent, revealing our footage underneath. From here, you can also just lower the opacity if you want to get this overlay looking exactly as you want it to. So that starts to look much better already. But then there's two things I like to add as well. So at the moment, it looks okay, but you can tell that my camera is on a tripod. There's no movement at all. So we can just make it look a little bit better by adding some fake camera movement. So we're going to open up the effects library. We're going to come down to the toolbox, expand that, and then we're going to go to effects, we're going to grab an adjustment clip. And we're going to drag this above everything. So above all of our footage and our overlay, and we'll just drag that out like so. And then still within the effects library, we're going to go down to open effects. We're going to scroll right down until you see this area here resolve effects transform. And we're going to grab camera shake, click and hold and drag that onto your adjustment clip. Now if we hit play, you can see it's shaking around like so. Looks pretty cool, but it's just a bit too strong. So we just need to lower the effect, give the adjustment clip a click, click on the inspector top right, then click on the open effects tab. And then you can see all the controls in here for the camera shake. Now experiment with these, I'm not going to go through all of them, but there's loads of fun to be had. I will cover the basics though. The top three, motion scale, speed scale, and then motion blur, motion blur is obviously the motion blur. I'm going to leave that as zero motion scale affects how much the camera actually moves. So see if I put that up, it moves around even more. And if I lower that, it moves around less. And then the speed scale is the speed that it moves. So I actually want this to come right down. I'm going to go with that 0.25 on the motion scale and speed scale. So once it's be relatively subtle, and now we've got something that looks like this, that camera movement just really adds to the effect and doesn't look like it's locked on a tripod, which just makes it look a little bit more dynamic. Now the very last thing we're going to add is some flickering lights. And now that's within the same section in the effects library, we've got this flicker addition, which is going to do the same thing. We're going to drag that onto our adjustment clip and let go. And then if we hit play, we've got this flickering light effect. Now that may be good enough for you, you may like it as it is. But if you want to make any changes, we just do the exact same thing. Click on the adjustment clip in the inspector in the open effects, you're probably going to see camera shake there by default. Just double click on the word camera shake at the top to minimize that. And then you've got flicker addition here, double click to open that. Again, just play with the settings in here. There's loads to mess with. But again, to cover the basics, you've got the flicker type, you can choose between lift, gain, gamma and vignette. Then you've got the range, the speed, the smoothness and the randomness. The range is the range between the light flicker and then the flicker being off. So I increase. So if I set that all the way to one, you can see it'll flicker loads. That's too strong. So we just reset that. The speed is obviously the speed of the flicker. The smoothness is how smooth it transitions to the flicker being on and off. And then the randomness is just the randomness of the flickering. So I'm going to leave the speed and the smoothness as it is. I'm going to bring the range right down to about 0.07 because I don't want it to be too bright at all. But I am going to increase the randomness scale. So it's nice and random and just flickers all over the place. And now I've got something that looks like this. So you combine all those different effects with a simple free overlay and some camera shake and a flicker addition and you've got yourself a really cool looking horror intro or clip or whatever you want to do with it. And there you go. I hope you enjoyed this special spooky Halloween edition. If you did, thumbs up. If you've got any comments or feedback, please do let me know down in the comments section below.
