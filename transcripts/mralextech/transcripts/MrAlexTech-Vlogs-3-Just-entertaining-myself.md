Yeah, he's good. He's good. He's good. Why that folks? It's Alex here. Welcome to another vlog. Now in this one, don't really have a plan. Just going to bring you along for the day and sort of make it up as we go. See what happens. He's right, you know. We don't have a plan. We don't have a message or a story that we're trying to convey. Just going to have a plan with some cool techniques and hopefully put together a somewhat interesting vlog. Might I suggest that we go get a coffee first though, because I am parched. Yeah. Do you reckon? Yeah. Yeah. Cheers. Now I know the whole coffee, b-roll thing is a little bit overdone. It's a little bit cliche, but I had some extra time this morning so I figured why the hell not? I also think it's kind of funny the way that I make coffee. Loads of people out there doing really cool b-roll with really complicated ways of making coffee. Now if that's what you're into, that's cool and I bet the coffee tastes way better. Don't get me wrong, but big flasks and filter paper and all that sort of stuff. I can't be bothered with all that. Pods, they do the job. They taste alright. Not quite strong enough for me though, so a bit of instant in there as well. I'm a manly man, so obviously latte is my coffee of choice. So I've ruffled that milk, slapped it all together. Good job then. Now unfortunately, it has rendered us pretty much out of milk, so I need to go down the right. I need to venture into the scary outdoors today to pick up some more essentials. So I figured I'd bring you guys along for the ride. I want to say ride, a dooming ride because we're going to be going down on my X-Way X1 Pro Electron X-Skateboard, which I adore. I've made a review or sort of first impressions video of it last year and I haven't made a video on it since, so I figured I'd just give you a quick update. It's just the best thing ever. Honestly, I love this thing. I use it all the time to nip down the shops. It's great. Backpack on. I love the way the shops grab the essentials. Shove them in the bag. Come back. Perfect. I can literally be there and back in five minutes, which is brilliant. I also use it to nip to the gym, nip into town. The gym I go to doesn't have a car park, so I can ride on this board. It fits in the locker. Do what I need to do. Ride home. Again, it's onto a absolute winner. As you can see in this B-roll, it does get utterly used and abused. It's absolutely filthy because I use it in all weathers. I do clean it, and I'm going to give it a clean after we get back from this ride. Anyway, enough of that. Let's hop on the board, nip down the road and grab what we need to get. All right. Oh, exposure. Exposure. That's us done. Got what we need to get. Time to give the X-ray a bit of a clean. Much needed clean. Obviously went out on the board, gave it a clean. What now? I just want into the ground. Alex, think about it. I want into the ground to understand who's voltar here. I'm not going to leave you with these things. Obviously went out on the board, gave it a clean, whatnot. Just come back to see how it's doing as it's been drying, and check this out. You couldn't make that up, could you? Leave it out in the sun to dry, bird poofs on it straight away. Not cool, man, not cool. Now, that time of the week again, it's time to film a five-minute Friday. Yeah. Now, if you ever wondered why my lighting and my framing looked a little bit different in pretty much every five-minute Friday, it's because to get in, I pretty much have to move this, which I use as a tripod, it's actually a light stand. Takes up less room than my big tripod, so I use a light stand. I pretty much have to move this when I'm not shooting, to actually have some room in here, and I have to move the light quite often as well. To make some space. So that's why it always looks that tiny bit different. So, yeah. Oh, bruh, glasses. Put the glasses on for the videos. Stay with it a bit more consistent. I think the hair is confusing people enough without contacts as well, so yeah. What up, folks? Alex here, and welcome to Five Minute Friday. Now, this video is a viewer request from a guy called Jukey567, who asks simply, can you do a...
