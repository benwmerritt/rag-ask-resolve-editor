Hey, how you doing mate? You good? I'm good. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Nice. Welcome to Mustard HQ. Oh there you go. Hello. Alright. That's a good start. Trashing the bloody place. Breaking it within a really... This is Darren Mustard. So if you don't know Darren, Darren is a fellow YouTuber talking about DaVinci Resolve but primarily talking about the colour page. Because Darren is a professional colourist. So I'm here to learn. We're going to have a nice little sit down. We're going to try and learn some stuff. I make no guarantees. And I've got some of your questions to throw at Darren as well. So we're going to have some fun. We'll run through some stuff and hopefully you'll find it useful and yeah, we'll just have a generally good time. And he won't let me see the questions which is rather annoying. Hello. Hello. Cool. So we're going to start off with a real simple one. How did you get into colour grading? Wasn't a traditional route. So I studied photography at our college. I became an editor. So I worked for a nonlinear manufacturer for a little while because it was the start of nonlinear editing. It was 1994 this is. So I've been around the block of it. I've seen some tech developments I promise you. And I've got two floppy bits there for the original Adobe Premiere. That's at 1.0. Running on Windows 3.11. Very old school. So I saw a nonlinear developer from the very start when it was pretty clunky to becoming quite efficient and the tools. I did a lot of sport highlight editing. So we did tennis, snooker for all that sort of stuff. We then started using some of the tools because the computers were getting faster. The software was getting better. So we could start doing colour contrast and saturation things like that in real time. So that was the start of me sort of dabbling with colour on my edits. But I got my first lucky break really wasn't a lucky break out. I edited a documentary for BBC. It's a long form documentary. And I actually graded it as well. So I did this in Final Cut Pro, which is the original Final Cut Pro. And that had some pretty good colour grading tools in there. And so I colour graded this documentary just so when we presented it for viewing it looked better. But I was only supposed to be offline editor for it. We took it to Soho. I went along to the grade as well just because I was really fascinated to see it all working. And the director actually preferred my grade. So we went to top Soho facility in the director actually preferred my grade. And I got all his grading work after that. So it's all BBC stuff. So that was my first big broadcast break really. I had I didn't have any of this kit then so I had a tangent wave which I bought. So just give me a little bit of control. So it's like the three balls and just give me a little bit of saturation control and things like that. I had a big broadcast CRT monitor. So it's a huge big heavy two man lift job that was sat over there. It was massive. It was like a Sony BVM. It was like it was the industry standard. But that gave me color accuracy. And I was offering color grading services. And because it was then affordable black magic bought DaVinci resolve systems. And the resolvers we know it today was or started was born. Yeah. So I've been on it since the very beginning since since black magic bought DaVinci systems. And so that's 13 14 years ago something like that. So it then became really affordable. And then obviously I've accumulated this kit over time and been kind of ready ever since. Brian Pavilion. There you go. Our most famous icon after Darren Mustard. What are the best resources available online to learn the most about color grading from starts to finish? You mean apart from my YouTube channel? Apart from the excellent actually no to say that that doesn't take you from start to finish. That's just random YouTube videos that will not take you from start to finish. So I think the online resources from black magic are great and they're free. There's a whole, you know, beginners guide to color grading in DaVinci resolve on there. It's written by down a who's a fantastic wealth of knowledge, really good friend. It's a really good course. And you can do that. You can do a little course at the end of it as well as you just sort test yourself and get certified. So I've thoroughly recommend that. Cool. What do you think is the right way to learn? You've kind of already answered this one. But do you think it's a course? Do you think it's getting just trying getting stuck in throwing things at you? Yeah, I'm not magic resources online are going to get you a good grounding. They're not going to go into major amounts of detail. And obviously, that's a one way street. There's no ability to ask questions or anything like that. So, you know, an online course is a great way to go. Do you research on where you're getting that course from? There's plenty of good ones out there. The experience is going to come in no two jobs are the same. So I'm, yeah, my experience tells me things like you might learn how to do key incorrectly. Then I know looking at a certain shot, whether it's even worth doing a key on it or not through just through experience, because I've been doing it a long time, and you just going to get better and better and better. There's no shoot. There's no fast track. There's no shortcut. I think you can get to a good level very quick these days. There's plenty. There's so much resources out there. And even just if you're watching YouTube videos and stuff, if they're from a good source, you can get some good knowledge pretty quick. So you won't have the massive long learning curve that I had. There was no resources when I was starting out. There was nothing on YouTube. I don't even know where I got my information from. So friends would speak on the phone. Remember that constant? Just practice and play. You know, you're not going to do any damage. That's what I do. But you could do a lot of damage actually. But it's not permanent damage. Yeah, you'll know what's wrong. Yeah. And that's the same with all of the videos, obviously. It gets stuck in clicks and buttons and see what happens. And if it looks horrible, just undo. We go. And on that, if it looks great to you, I don't really care how you got there. If it looks great, you can't be. There's no right or wrong way. We're going to go right or wrong. There's better ways. But there's no right. What would be the first tool you'd advise someone to learn? Color management. Color management 100%. Now a lot of people find that quite daunting. I've got a few episodes on my channel that hopefully explain that in layman's terms. But if you can get your head around color management, that's going to give you a really good head start technically. If you look at color management, you just like, I have no idea what is going on here. I would suggest that you start playing with these tools, the sort of primary color wheels. You've got lift gamma gain, which is shadow mid tones highlights, if you like. But this one here offset, this is actually adjusting that overall image. So this is going to do the biggest first step for color grading. This is my first go to tool. Okay. So I'm using this all the time. And if I lift up here, you'll see that I'm just lifting exposure, if you like. And if I move the little dot in the middle, I can make it warmer, cooler, that sort of thing. I'm going to go back to color management. You haven't escaped it just yet. I could talk about color management for a long time. Yeah, it's probably me that's escaping. Do you have a preference or any advice in regards to using the built-in resolve color management, the auto color management, or using a CST? CST color space transform. Yeah. Okay. So effectively they're both going to give you the same result. So first of all, it doesn't actually matter which the automatic color management is happening before you start your grade and after you start your grade. The input side of it is happening before your grade. The output side is happening after your grade. With the CST route, color space transform routes, I can control where it actually happens in my node tree. So I tend to work with the CST workflow. It's pretty well documented on my channel. You can have a look at most of my episodes. I kind of explain it. I just want to be in control of where it goes. And I do some quirky things as well that just take you out of, would take you out of your comfort zone. We don't need to go down there. But the need of the marine corrective, if you're using one or the other, you're going down a good route. Got you. And on that very similar note, where'd you put it? For me, I have one at the beginning and one at the end. Okay. And it's not strictly right at the beginning either, but for arguments I can save you an hour's explanation. Let's say it's at the beginning and you certainly want to be grading under one. So if you're only going to, if you, if you're saying start or end, I would be going end and grading under it. But I have one at the beginning, which takes me to a certain color space. And then the end I come from that color space back to my output color space, which is effectively what the auto color management's doing. Go ahead. I'm just controlling where. Hey, I need to let you know that I wouldn't be able to make videos just like this one without the support from awesome channel sponsors like audio. Audio is a music subscription service that has a highly curated catalog of music and sound effects, which you can use for basically any project that license covers you for YouTube podcasts, video games, films, and even TV. And there's a huge selection of music to pick from covering all genres from pop, hip hop, rock, electric and everything in between. And that audio pro license gives you unlimited downloads of all of that music plus that sound effects. And it's available for a special price of just 59 bucks for your first year. And any equipment you download during that year, your license to continue using forever, even after you cancel. So to get started, simply head over to audio.com forward slash Alex. There's a link down in the description below and then use the code Alex 70 at checkout. Awesome. Right. Let's get back to Darren, shall we? Cool. We're going to start talking a little bit more about hardware. OK. So what's the bare minimum hardware you would recommend for someone trying to get into color grading? Calibrated. You certainly don't need all this stuff that I've got here. Bear in mind, this is, you know, I've not just done a massive shopping list and bought this in what this is 17 years of accumulated stuff. My monitor is my that's my hero monitor by the best monitor you can possibly afford. That's where your money is best spent. I box is other good investment. So I've got I've got a ultra studio, four cake stream. They do ones that start at I think it has to be black magic. Maybe magic to work with to be resolved. But I think they start at ninety nine pounds. You just get the little boxes that's going to give you a better feed from your computer. I've got an episode on that as well, actually, but this gives you a better feed to your monitor and he's got to trust this. Yeah, that's wrong. It's got no chance when it goes out into the rest of the world and gets viewed on people's random devices that are all sorts of color settings. Yeah, on a similar question, which kind of goes exactly against the answer you've just given. How could you correct or even check white balance if you know you're on an uncalibrated screen? Some people obviously working on laptops or they have a monitor. And that's kind of all they they have at the moment. Any tips to try and get the most out of a bad situation? Yeah, get it calibrated. OK, so if you're honest, if you're on a screen and you don't know if it's calibrated or not, I mean, you're still kind of working a little bit blind, but you can use the scopes down here. So you'll find as you might be defaulting to this keyframe thing. If you just click on here, you get your scopes. Waveform is going to show me my brightness. So you've got a black level at the bottom and your whites at the top. But it's not going to show me color balance. OK, let's just show you brightness. So if I go to my Vexoscope, that trace in the middle, in fact, if I press this, I can pop that out. And I guess it's a bit bigger. That trace in the middle is reading the saturation levels in this image. So if I let me just desaturate that shot for you, you'll see that all you get is a dot in the middle. There's no saturation. So if I take that off, my saturation is leaning towards red and yellow, these two little boxes here. So I know that this shot is slightly warm. OK, but I still can't really tell if I'm white balanced or not. And bear in mind, I might not want whites to be white. OK, but I'm going to switch to this one. If I switch to my parade, this one here is measuring my brightness and it's showing me the red, green and blue channels. All right, so what I can do here is look at the top here is my highlights. So red and green are kind of at the same point. Green is sitting a little bit lower, I say, but blue is considerably lower in the highlights. OK, so in the shadows, it's a bit more balanced. So I know that we're definitely a bit warm. There's less blue in the highlights, which will give us a warmer image. So for me to balance these out, I would need to take something like my offset tool or my game tool here and just push towards blue. And you can see that starts balancing up. And I did that just looking at the scopes and that actually looks better now. If I switch that switch that node on and off, you see it's actually cleaned it up just by looking at it. Excellent. If you want your whites white, these have to line up. That's the law. Excellent. That's a great tip. There you go. The next one, which is very, very similar. You've already talked about white balance. What about skin tones? So skin tones you can measure on a vectorscope. So my scopes, just to point out that I mean, ideally, you want these on a separate monitor because you're going to use them a lot once you get used to what they do and how they work, they really become like your best friend. OK, it's a combination of looking at my output one set and this. But I've got a dedicated system for scopes over here. So I'm actually running on a completely separate feed on a separate bit of software. I use a thing called OniScope. It's no better quality than the Resolve scopes, but I've got more types of scope so I can actually I've got better tools, but it's the same information. If it's the RGB parade that I'm looking at here is exactly the same measurement on here. I've just got different types of scopes as well. So I've got a skin tone line on my vectorscope up permanently. OK, and I'll show you that if you go to the vectorscope, which is measuring as we mentioned before, saturation, then what I can do is click on the settings here and I can say show skin tone indicator. And this line is a general line as to where skin tone should be sitting. OK, it's not the law. People obsess that it's got to say exactly on that line. It's a guide. OK, and we can see here quite clearly. There's my skin tone and it's sitting just slightly above that line, but not to a point where I would be too worried about it. You might have it. It's a very cool atmosphere. I'm very dark. It's all those things you need to come into consideration as well. Good. And it's a good tool, especially when you're starting out. Yeah, aim for it and then go from there. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you very much. Talk to me next about nodes. How many is too many? When should I make another node? I know that's a few questions. Any sort of real quick fire? Just a little thumb tips, tricks when you win. Yeah, I mean, I would start with just serial nodes. OK, and just think of it like layers, if you like. OK, so I work on what's called a fixed node tree. So my node tree looks the same for every program I'm doing, but it keeps me disciplined, but it's quite an advanced technique. I think when you're starting out, just get node number one. I've already got two nodes that have done something on here. So node number three, and I might just do something. And here I might just want to warm this shot back up again. We sort of cooled it down earlier. I might want to take out a bit of saturation, for example. This is not really my sort of regular working way. But when I get to there and if I stop to think, I'm like, what do I do next? I just have another node to go and the advantage of that. So let's just I've already gotten prebuilt here. But if I go to node number four, what you would do is right click on here and say add serial node or option S. That would add another serial node. And then you can just start doing some other stuff. So let's say, for example, I'm doing a little bit of curve, something like that and being random here. But if I decide I don't like that, I can switch this node on and off just to try it. I mean, that's where we were before, but I've not lost that information. If I'd done all that on one node, when I switch the node on and off, like I'm taking off to my levels. Yeah. So this is like that's the little move I did there. This is just the curve. So it means I could just switch it on and off and say whether I like it or not. And go, yeah, I like it. It's a bit heavy. So let's just pull it back a bit. Something like that. I'm stopping to think of an idea. Next node. So once again, it's there's no necessary right or wrong way. It's whatever works for you. What's your workflow? Yeah, you can do that. I mean, the majority of my grade is done within three or four nodes. The real bulk of the work, everything else is just little stuff that I'm doing. It might be little windows, texture tools, that sort of thing. But you should be able to get there in three or four nodes. But if it takes you 20 nodes together, it doesn't matter. It's not doing any damage. That's really good to know, because I think sometimes you see with massive node trees and you get is that what you actually need? Or is that the real sort of 99 percent stuff? So if you look at my fixed node trees, there actually can be. I've got a few different ones, but let's argue there. Twenty nodes I might be using for them. Go ahead. So I have empty nodes. In fact, even on here, this node number five here has got nothing on it. It's not doing any damage. It's just sitting there. It's just there if you were to need it. Yeah, but I would build it up from scratch. I would ignore all these I've got here. Just one node, maybe start with offset, second node, bit of contrast, third node, bit of saturation, for example. Go ahead. Just build it up from there. Makes sense. And when you start with getting to parallels and stuff, I have got a pretty good episode on my channel. I think it's a pretty good episode. Links down below. Moving on. I'll buy you lunch. So obviously the micro panel being the entry level panel to get into color grading, would you recommend it? Yeah, any panel I would thoroughly recommend. So, you know, get your monitor first. Next thing's your panel. Okay, it's going to help you. Let's move on to that next node. We've got a new idea coming up. So let's just move on to that. If I want to start adjusting these controls, I'm just using my pen and tablet. I don't use a mouse, but it's the same as using a mouse. And I'm trying to control that. And these little, what look like little tiny moves are actually doing a lot of image manipulation there. Okay. So using the panel, I can control these using the balls and I get much finer control. Okay. It also means I can do two things at once. So I can control like this. Instead of going, I want a little bit of gain and then I want to bring my lift down a bit as two separate items. So I really like the panel for that. Obviously I've got the advanced panel. This is giving me pretty much one touch operation for everything in the color page. You don't need this. The micro panel will do great. Micro panel is primaries only. So it's pretty much sort of these tools, saturation, temperature and that sort of stuff as well. The next one up, which is the mini panel, will give you secondary controls as well. So you can start adjusting things like keys and I think it's got tracking and stuff on there as well. But any panel is good. You can even do your third party ones as well. I mean, let's start at a few hundred quid. Tangent do some. I think DaVinci Resolve supports quite a few different control. But the micro one is a particularly good one because it's the same technology on the balls and rings as the mini and the advanced panel. So it's really, and it's really well getting obviously it's totally designed to work with DaVinci Resolve. And it's relatively affordable. Obviously compared to the advanced panel. I was buying again now. I mean, I've had this about 10, 11, 12 years. Those panels weren't available. If I was buying now, I'd buy a mini panel and something like a stream deck to go with it to give me extra functionality. That was one of my next questions. Any other bits of gear that you'd recommend? I said, you know, what stream day? So this is great. This is the 32, but I want to stream deck Excel. It's a pretty random stuff on the front page to be honest with you. Like my radio channels and that sort of stuff. But I do have it configured for DaVinci Resolve as well, even though I've got the advanced panel. I've got some of the nice tools like the speed. This is great. For the, yeah, for the editing page. If I go to my color settings on here, these are my own programs. You can buy templates and stuff like that. But I've just got ones that complement the advanced panel. So things like my printer lights, which is effectively these things down here and the offset tool. I can do that on the panel, but I'd like to have these colored buttons on here. I find it just a little bit more tactile, a bit more user-friendly on here. I've got play heads on here. Again, I kind of kind of do this stuff on the advanced panel, but sometimes it's a two or three switch. Yeah. Whereas on here, I'm just straight into it. It's just nice and easy. So this is a great compliment too. Particularly on the smaller panels, you could load memories in there. So if you were to gather the mini or the micro along with something like the stream deck, probably be a pretty nice little come up. So it's true. Brits, all we eat is fish and chips. That's all we eat. Roast dinners on Sunday. Fish and chips six days a week. What we having for dinner? Not fish and chips. So next one, how essential do you think color grading is for online content creators, AKA YouTubers like us? Do you grade your YouTube footage or do you focus more on efficiency than than anything else? I don't grade my footage. I was thinking that she said it. So the only reason I don't grade it is a just speed. Okay. I'm normally so relieved that I've actually got round to making a YouTube episode for a start and then actually edited it and done it. And then you've got working all the thumbnails and all that sort of stuff. So I've now got to point up into it for a long time is the look is set in my camera. So I've got Sony a seven is three. Uh, I don't use S log on it. I use one of the cine profiles. I just tweaked it a little bit and obviously my life in set up stays exactly the same each time. So for me, it's quite easy. The looks already there. I mean, if you took my online content, we do a lot of branded content here. I mean, I don't just do TV stuff. It's, we do a lot of music videos and branded content. That gets the same treatment as a TV commercial would. So, yeah, but it's going on YouTube. I think if you're talking about content creators specifically, which you mentioned, I think if they're working, if they're always filming in the same environment and it does need a grade, you could build a grade and you could literally grab that as a still and it's there for future efforts. You only have to grade it once. And once you've got a look that you like, you can literally film all your YouTube episodes and just apply that grade to everything. Is that the recommended way to grab the preset and then, you know, share it amongst? Yeah, what you can do, actually, you've got these things called stills. But if you go down to power grade, you can create your own. If I right click here, you say add power grade album. And if I'm right clicking, drop that into a power grade. What will happen is when I create a new project, that still will still be available across all the projects, whereas in stills, they are project specific. Yeah, it's the color based version of a power bin. Correct. There you go. I used to grade some of my earlier YouTube stuff, but that was because I was I mean, it just looked terrible anyway, and it still looks terrible. I'll try to make sure that this video doesn't look terrible with one of my awful grades because it may. Now, if your channel is going to look better than me, Darren taught me how to grade this. There's only so much I can teach you. Next one. Let's discuss. Good. Bad. Fuck you guys. Discuss. I say it's been discussed for years, isn't it? Good. Good. Lots of good. No problem. We know bad. Let's have had. So you need to know where your lots have come from. So lots that you just buying off random YouTubers that you don't know that they've been what's called stress tested, I would say can look great, but can also fall apart very quickly. So they might look great on your first 10 shots and you can come to another shot and you can like, what's that weird blit there? That's a bad look. Most Hollywood feature films would be would be graded under a Lutz. They'd have a show Lutz on there. So it's a lot that's been specifically designed to work for that feature, but also won't be doing any damage at all to any color grading that they're doing. I would suggest if you want to look at buying Lutz, there's some good people out there who are coming. Cullen Kelly has some Lutz that are great. He's a really good channel. Jason Bodak, he has some Lutz that you can buy. So they're reputable people, they're color scientists, they know what they're doing. So nothing wrong with Lutz as long as you get from the right place. Yeah. I suppose if you get them from the wrong place and you like it, there's also nothing wrong with that. Yeah. But technically you could be getting tricked up pretty quickly. Got ya. Last question. What's next for Darren Losten? I'm quirky. Well, I'm coming up to a hundred thousand. I'm getting pretty excited about that. And I've got a little bit to go yet, but my hundred thousand subscribers would be. What are you on now? I'm really looking for, say about 88. 88. Oh yeah, not long to go. I used to look like immediately in the morning, go like this. I mean, I've kind of calmed down on that as well now. But yeah, I'm looking forward to that happening. So I'll be coming up for three years, send this month, hit the hundred thousand, I'll put it retire then. No, what? I don't think YouTube's ever gonna let me retire, is it? No, no. It's the best thing I've ever did. I'm so much fun with it. And just, you know, making friends, like you become a really good friend. It's great. I love the whole. The community behind it is wicked, isn't it? Yeah, it's great. It's a lot of fun. I've never thought three years ago I'd be doing it and it work as well as it. Yeah. Cool. That's it. Thank you very much. You're very welcome. It's been a lot of fun. Beer. And now we're going to go... To the pub. ...to buy some food and have a beer. Yeah. Watch. All right, nice one. Cheers. Cheers, mate. That's it. That's good after all that talking. Until next time. Next time? Yeah, next time. I'm coming again. You know.
