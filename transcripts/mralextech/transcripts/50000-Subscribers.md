I've got a balloon. What up folks? Alex here. I'm back. Welcome to Mr. Alex Tech and I just wanted to make a real quick video to say we hit 50,000 subscribers. Hey, so Mr. Alex Tech officially now has over 50,000 of you lovely subscribers. So thank you. Paul, I really wanted to say, massive thank you to each and every one of you for coming here, watching the videos, thumbs up, comments, subscribing, donating, buying me coffee, downloading things, whatever you do, you hear and it's amazing. So just want to say real quick, thank you. I always make these videos whenever I hit a big milestone. It wasn't that long ago when we did the 40,000 subscribers and now obviously we hit in the 50,000. So yeah, it's just insane really. We've had the year at just over 10,000. Well, I think it was close to about 14,000 in January and now we're at 50. Really crazy. So maybe I can hit 55,000, 60K by the end of the year, but honestly, I'm just happy to be here with this 50,000 subscribers. It's more than I ever expected. So yeah, it's awesome and thank you very much. The balloon is off my lovely wife who decided to buy me a 50 balloon once I hit the 50,000 subs. She's tried to get the five and O but can actually get two separate ones. So I've got this one. I know I am an old man compared to a lot of you, but I'm not quite 50. It's not my age. It's for the 50,000 subs. So yeah, got a balloon. I like a balloon. And that's about it really. Just wanted to take this time to address you all and say thank you and do that sort of thing. So, thank you for the channel. We're just going to keep doing what we're doing. I have started to diversify a little bit. Hopefully you've noticed it's still heavily towards the venture result, but I am doing other things which is really good fun. We're going to keep doing that. As always, if you've got any other things you'd like to see, anything you'd like to send me a branch out to, any suggestions, whatever, pop them down in the comments below. It's always good to read. I always like having a look to see what you guys and girls suggest. So please keep doing that. And that's it really. We're just going to keep plugging away. Keep doing what we're doing. Keep trying my best to provide good, fun content and tutorials for all of you guys. I've got some more transition packs in the work. They are taking a little while. It's just struggling to find the time when I'm balancing everything else at the minute, but I will get those sorted. And yeah, we just keep going really. That's all you can do. Keep plugging away. Obviously, funnier, stranger, 2020. Things are being a bit weird. But this is a silver lining because this is going really well. And I'm still enjoying it. I'm still having a little fun little side hobby that I'm doing. I have no plans to go full time with YouTube. Someone mentioned that in a comment the other day. I have no plans. It makes money. I can share how much this YouTube makes. If that's of interest, let me down down in the comments below. I happily make a how much money I make at 50,000 subs video if people are interested. I won't do it if no one's interested because it just seems showbooty or like I'm bragging. But if people want to know, I happily do that. But yeah, I don't earn enough to go full time with it as of yet. And I like the security of having a full time job anyway, to be honest. But yeah, there you go. Now I'm just talking nonsense. So thank you ever so much for being here. As always, thank you for all your likes, all your love, all your subs, all your shares. Everything keep doing what you guys are doing, supporting me and the channel because I really appreciate it. And I've actually got a few videos I want to get live during the week. So I feel I'll be able to post them during the week. I've actually got a really busy week, I've got loads of exciting things going on. So you might even get a vlog this week because some cool stuff's happening, which is rare. Usually nothing exciting happens, but we have cool stuff happening. Somehow you'll have a vlog of that as well. So yeah, some more stuff coming this week. Continue doing what we're doing for the foreseeable future and see what happens. So thanks, folks. Take it easy. I'll see you next time. See ya. Ah.
