What up folks it's Alex here and this is the Osmo Pocket. Now I've been using this tiny little camera to do some vlogs, to do some b-roll and that sort of thing for the past few months now and I'm not afraid to admit I'm quite a big fan of this tiny little thing. So in this video I'm going to show you some quick tips and tricks that I've learned over the past few months using this thing which should help you get the most out of this tiny little beast. So let's get straight to it shall we? This is a super duper obvious one but it's worth mentioning and that is this. The day of port at the front of your Osmo Pocket. Of some people leaving this sticking out the side like so. If you pop your adapter out swivel it around plunk it back in it will sit flush on your Osmo Pocket. It won't be protruding out the side you're not going to knock it you're not going to catch it you're not going to break it. Swivel it around slide it in that way much much nicer. Tip number one super easy and simple that one. Tip number two is another really obvious one but again I've seen people missing this one and it's simply that front button. That button on the right hand side does multiple things and you should use it more than you think. If you're in a menu system and you're scrolling through let's say that you're changing your frame rate so you slide over from the right you select video and then you then select your video options let's say 4k 24 frames per second you then don't need to keep flicking from the left to go back. If you simply push this button it will take you straight back to the main recording screen. Now admittedly that's a quick one it'll only save you a second or two but if you're always doing that it can just make your life that little bit easier. And then when you're actually recording or when you're out and about if you push that button once it will switch between photo and video mode. Quickly tap that button twice and it will recenter the gimbal so if you're in follow mode and you've pointed it upwards or downwards and you want to just really quickly get it back to point forwards get it to the center give that one a quick double tap and then tap that three times to switch between forward facing and selfie mode. So again if you're vlogging quickly record yourself quickly flip it around and record whatever is going on ahead of you. You might use that little button it can actually save you quite a lot of time. Tip number three get a grip. One of the Osmo pocket's greatest features is also one of its greatest issues in my opinion and that's its size. Because it's so small it can be a little bit difficult to grip. I don't have the biggest hands in the world but I've got to admit I do struggle with it. On top of that because it's so small and light I actually find it quite difficult to move smoothly. If you're holding it really dainty it's kind of difficult to get steady. And last but not least and one of the worst things about it is there's no tripod mount and that's where a good quality grip comes in. And the one I'm using is the Polar Pro grip system. Now this one is really really good I'm really impressed with it because it's got a real nice thick grip on the back it's got a rubberized texture place for your finger and a place for your thumb around the front. It gives you much more to hold on to and it makes it that little bit heavier. You can steady it with two hands you can get your steady shot and you just you don't feel like you're going to drop it so it's really nice solution. On top of that there's three tripod mounts. There's two across the bottom one across the top as you can see on mine I've attached a Coltume mount so I can shove a microphone on this thing. And then this over on the left hand side is a grip for your phone. So if you do want to go out you want to take some b-roll you need to get a bigger screen put your phone in here it'll hold it steady it's actually the data port without a grip attaching your phone to my pocket is janky and it's just an accident waiting to happen in my opinion I really don't like attaching my phone without the grip and this solves all those issues. One quick downside I have to mention you can't attach the DJI microphone adapter to the bottom of your ice my pocket and still use that tripod mount. You either have to use one or the other fortunately they've thought of that they've put one over here as well so you can still use a tripod and a microphone. Job done. Really really nice bit of kit. Now when you buy this grip you actually get this with it so this is the Osmo pocket cage and how it works is you put the cage on your Osmo pocket you slide your Osmo pocket into the grip like so tighten it up and it's in there for good it's not going anywhere nice and secure. If you don't want to use the grip you just want to use the Osmo pocket on its own because you're going somewhere you want to travel real light then you've still got this cage on it and the cage itself has two tripod mounts one on the side one on the bottom so you can still attach a microphone to this thing you can still attach a tripod to it it's just way more usable using this system. PolarPro actually sell this cage on its own but it's 25 bucks you can get the whole grip system so cage and the handheld grip for 35 bucks so it's a no-brainer in my opinion if you're looking for something like this just grab the grip system rather than just the cage on its own and then you get the best of both worlds really really handy. Tip number four the Osmo pocket is actually really good straight out of the box you can leave it in auto and actually do quite a good job but if you want to get the best footage you're going to have to take over some of those controls yourself and to do that you need to activate Pro mode. Now Pro mode gives you more access to some of the different frame rates which we're going to talk about in a moment and it also allows you to set your exposure i.e. your ISO and your shutter speed manually as well as being able to set your white balance. And to activate Pro mode simply swipe down from the top scroll over a few times until you see the Pro icon and then give that a tap until that it's highlighted in white and if you shoot back to your main screen here you can now see that says Pro in the top left hand corner if you give that a click and then go to exposure you can then click on the M to just go to manual and from here you can choose your shutter speed on the left hand side and your ISO on the right hand side. Also if you click on your Pro icon again here you can then see your white balance give that a click set it to auto or you can choose your particular white balance as you need it. Enable Pro mode learn how all these settings work and I guarantee you'll start to get better footage out of your Osmo pocket. Tip number five shoot at 48 frames per second now this is going to be a controversial one but hear me out now everyone generally on YouTube in the world is advising people to stick to the 180 degree shutter angle which if you don't know dictates that your shutter speed should be twice that of your frames per second so if you're shooting at 24 frames per second your shutter speed should be as close as you can get it to 1 48th of a second which on the Osmo is 1 50th of a second. Now that is absolutely correct it will get you the best looking most cinematic footage with a nice amount of motion blur and all that sort of thing but the problem is if you're switching between 24 frames and then 60 frames per second to get some slow motion it's a fath so what I prefer to do is shoot at 48 frames per second and use a 360 degree shutter angle instead so you shoot at 48 frames per second and then you'll set your shutter speed to 150th of a second. Now why do you do that? Well it's simple and it's purely down to convenience 48 frames per second is exactly twice that is exactly double of 24 frames per second so if you shoot at 48 frames per second at 150th of a second and put that footage onto a 24 frames per second timeline and play it back at real time real speed what your editing package will do is simply skip every other frame so then you'll end up with 24 frames all of which last for 150th of a second which is identical to if you shot at 24 frames at 150th of a second so it will look almost identical to if you shot at 24 frames per second so why bother? Well because you've shot at 48 frames per second if you don't want the footage playing back at real time you can take that 48 frames per second play it back at 50% speed and then you've got 50% slow-mo that one second of footage will last two seconds on a 24 frames per second timeline so then you've got some slow motion so rather than having to change settings where you go swapping between 24 and 60 swapping ND filters changing shutter speeds you shoot your FPS once you set your shutter speed once you put the ND filter on that you need and then you just leave it you film everything for 48 frames per second and then in post you can choose to play back in real speed to look almost identical to 24 frames per second with the same amount of motion blur because you're shooting at the same shutter speed but look basically the same or you can slow it down to get some 50% slow motion job done way less hassle or save you loads of time and 99% of your audience won't even be able to have a difference everything you see now is being filmed on the ultimate pocket at 4k 48 frames per second and as you can see it looks great I do the old wave test you can see that looks nice and natural it's not choppy at all looks really good and I can choose to play this back in real time which what I'm doing now or in slow motion like so now obviously when you slow 48 frames per second down you're only slowing it down 50% whereas if you shot at 60 frames per second on a 24 frames per second timeline you'd be slowing it down 60% so your slow motion isn't quite as slow but it's only 10% so it still looks pretty damn good but that's really the only downside and there's some other positives which I didn't mention earlier and that's the active track still worked at 4k 48 frames per second so at the minute the Osmo Pocket is tracking my face which you can't do at 60 frames per second so the Osmo Pocket is more capable at 48 frames per second than is at 60 so it's not only more convenient because you don't have to mess around with settings you just set it once and forget but you also have more recording options which should help you get even better footage now if you're doing that you will still need ND filters because you'll still need to control your shutter speed I use these these are the Polar Pro Vivid series I've got an ND4 an ND8 and an ND16 now the reason I shoot with these is A they're really great ND filters anyway but these are also polarized filters which brings me to tip number six now if you don't know what polarizing filters do they actually help to cut some of the reflections from your video now when you think reflections you're probably just thinking of things like water and windows now they obviously reflect the most but actually almost everything reflects a little bit of light so if you use a polarizing filter you can actually make the sky look bluer greens look greener water looks a hell of a lot better even things like concrete or the ground the pavement reflect a surprising amount of light and if you use a polarizing filter you can help cut through all of that will immediately make your footage look more contrasty a little bit more saturated it'll just look a hell of a lot better you simply slap one on to the front of your Osmo pocket point it at the thing you're about to record rotate the front element until things look a bit better and so you can see it cutting through the reflections hit record and off you go job done grab yourself a polarizer and you'll immediately start seeing a difference and for my last real quick tip get creative and don't forget to utilize the gimbal on the Osmo pocket it's really easy to get into the habit of just shooting this thing like it's a smartphone or like it's an action cam and just pointing and shooting make use of that gimbal do some cool sweeping or cinematic reveal movement you can use the gimbal to do some really cool in-camera transitions a previous video was I have to do exactly that so click on the link above to watch that grab a tripod or in my case a dirt cheek mono pod and then you've got yourself a real nice hugely long extension pole for your Osmo pocket use it to get really high and get some cool angles or flip it upside down like that you can get really close to the ground as I did in one of my previous vlogs where I was messing around on my electric skateboard get really close to the ground and get some really cool footage with this thing another great one take it off here put it on a tripod you can get some amazingly smooth pans with the Osmo pocket even if your tripod's not that great at panning movements the Osmo pocket gimbal will help smooth out any jerkiness and you can get some real good product shots real nice slow panning shots using that gimbal so get creative have some fun and make sure you're really utilizing that gimbal on the Osmo pocket I hope all that was useful folks if it was give me a thumbs up if you've got any comments or feedback show them down below thanks for watching I'll see you next time cheerio you
