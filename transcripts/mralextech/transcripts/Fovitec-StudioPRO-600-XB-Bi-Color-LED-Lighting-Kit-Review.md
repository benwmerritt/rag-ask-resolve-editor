What up, folks? My name's Alex. You're watching Mr. Alex Tech, and in this video, we're going to be talking about these. This is the FoveyTech 600XB LED light panel. Now, you can buy these light panels as an individual unit, or you can buy them as a kit, which comes with two lights, and that's what we're going to be talking about in this video today. Now, this entire video was shot using one of these lights set at 65% power with the frosted diffuser attached. Now, quick caveat, FoveyTech did reach out to me and did send me these lights for free. However, they're not paying me to make this video or anything like that. So all views and opinions are entirely my own, as they always will be. So before we actually get into some of the nitty gritty and start talking about the LED light panels themselves, let's just talk about some of those accessories which come in the box, starting off with the light stands, and they're actually quite good. They're quite nice light stands. They're far better than a lot of the standard Scorni light stands that you get within budget lighting kits. They're thicker than the usual sort of light stands with a nice big, strong, wide, stable base. They're also spring loaded, which again is a nice touch, which just makes life a little bit easier when you put in the lights up and down. They're also really tall. They stand at just over eight foot, which is 2.4 meters, and therefore weight limit of about nine pounds. And then each comes with its own power cable. Now, these power cables are really, really long, which is another big thumbs up for me. There's nothing worse than when you buy a light with a decent light stand, and they give you the shortest cables in the world, so you can't actually plug the damn thing in. Now, another bonus on the power cable, you've got your power brick, which separates here. Again, sometimes they may give you a real long cable, but the power brick section is too short. So even though you've got a long cable, you've still got a power brick that's sort of hovering in midair, hanging off the floor. Not the case here again. What I'm going to do, power brick is currently on the floor with my foot on it, and I can put that right up there. Now, I'm about five foot, 10-ish, so I'm under six foot, but that's a good, I don't know, six and a half, seven foot. So you can get these things nice and high in a position you want them without the power brick flailing around, brushing into the light stand, and causing all sorts of havoc, which again is a nice little touch for me. Big thumbs up there. Now, as mentioned, they come with two different diffusers. So you've got this one, which is a slightly frosted sort of opaque diffuser, which will just help to soften the light a little bit without cutting too much of the power. And then we've got this one, which is a slightly heavier defrosted diffuser, which again will just help to soften the light a little bit more at the cost of a little bit of power output. You get four of those because you get two of each for each of the lights. Now, the diffuser is attached simply by sliding in to the side of the light stand like so. Because they slide in from the side, rather than the top of the bottom, there's no real risk of them sliding out during use. They're pretty secure once they're in and job done. Now, quick note, you can't double them up. There's only room within there for one of the panels. It's one or the other. So the most you can really do is this frosted panel like I've got here. Now, you also get these barn doors, which simply open and close like so. Now, I don't think too fancy, but they do the job. They're not felted or anything. So they do reflect some of the light, but they serve a purpose and they do what they're designed to do. They do also fold flat so they can be used to add a little bit of protection to the LEDs during storage or when you're taking them out about that sort of thing. It's also worth point out that they do detach really easily. There's some little clasps and they just pop on and pop off. So if you're not using them, you want to just take them off. It's really easy. Just take them off, fold them flat, put them away for storage and job done. So again, quite a nice handy little addition there. And then last but not least, we've got this soft little carry case. So you get two of these, one for each of the lights. Got a little handle on it. It's not the most sort of fancy thing in the world, but it's just the job. It's got some padding in it. It's got room for the light itself with the barn doors attached, both of the diffusers and the power cable. So you can get everything you need within these two travel cases. And you get all of that for just £329 or £379 in the US. It definitely puts it within the budget range because LED panels can start to get really quite expensive really quite quickly. Now also worth mentioning that Fovotec quite often have deals on. So keep your eye on the website and you may be able to pick them up for a little bit cheaper as well. Now I'm just going to take the barn doors off a moment. Get them out of the way. Now as you can see, it's actually a relatively compact unit. We're talking 15 by 15 inches and just three inches thick, which really is the big benefit of the LED panels. If you're looking at LED panel lights, it's probably because you're short on space or you want something that's really easy to look around. And this again, it's a nice size. It's not too big. It's not too thick. It's relatively easy to set up in small spaces like I've got in here. It's pretty much a full metal casing. I think it's aluminium, which does make it nice and strong while still being quite light. Now I can actually vouch for the durability of these things because I knocked one over when it was set to about six foot. And while there's a little bit of a dent on one of the barn doors, it held up really well. No breakages, nothing, and it's still going strong today. It's actually the one I'm using right now. It was my own fault. No fault with the light sign or anything like that. Oh, it just wasn't paying attention. Pulled the cable and managed to drag it over. So there you go. I can vouch for the durability of these things. Now in terms of the mount or bracket, it's a full metal construction and we've got 360 degrees of rotation with tightening bolts on the left and right hand side. Now this is currently mounted in where I'm going to refer to as the vertical position, but you can just unscrew this and you can mount it horizontally instead like so, which is a nice touch. It just gives you that little bit more flexibility so that you can angle the light exactly how you want it. For example, you can now use this for some overhead lighting if you wanted to, if you're doing some desktop miniature photography or something like that. Now that's actually how I've got mine mounted in that horizontal position because it just brings the light just that little bit closer towards me, which just helps to keep it soft and reduce some of those sharp, harsh shadows. Now there aren't any additional sort of modifier mounts on here, so there's no umbrella mounts or anything like that. You are stuck with just using those diffusers which came in the package. Now at front, we've got a total of 600 LEDs. 300 of those are a daytime balanced 5600K or the other 300 are a much warmer tungsten star 3200K. And of course, you get everything in between. They produce a decent CRI scale rating of 95 plus and they produce 2600 lux at just one meter. Now that lux or the power rating isn't actually that high. 2600 lux for this size panel isn't that great. You will be able to find other light panels which produce more light for a similar size and cost. But there is a reason for that and it's because of the way that this manages its bicolor. You see the power output for this light is consistent throughout the range, which means you get slightly more consistency, but that means you get reduced power. So let me just turn it on and I'll explain. Now sometimes with LED light panels, what'll actually happen is when you're at the top end or the bottom end of the range, so in my case here, I'm at 3200, the 300 light will be on at full power. And then as the others come in, so as we go to the middle of the range, those 3200K lights will stay on full power and the 5600K ones will also start to come in. So when you're at the very middle of the range, you've got all of your LEDs on at full power. So you'll end up producing 100% right in the middle of the range. As you go to either the top or the bottom of the range, you'll actually be operating at just 50% power. So you get the most power in the middle of the range and then you get half power at the top or the bottom of the range. What Fovotec have done here is as you go through the range, they dim. So as you can see, we've got our 5600K here as we're roughly in the middle, which is about there. Those 5600K lights have actually dimmed down to 50%, which is why you technically get less power than a lot of other light panels because we haven't got that full and full right in the middle of the range. Now, there is a trade-off there. So that makes these a little bit more consistent if you're looking to adjust your temperature mid-shoot. Because the power output is consistent no matter where you are, your exposure will be consistent as well. Fovotec actually do an XD version of this light, which isn't by color, it's purely 5600K. And as you'd expect, that means that it produces 5200 lux at one meter rather than the 2600 lux of this light here. So you need to decide whether you want the pure power output and you're only going to use 5600K or whether the by color would be useful and you can make do with having half of the power but consistent power throughout the range. Now, that's not to say that I believe these lights to be underpowered. They still provide plenty enough good quality light for many different video and photography uses. All of this video, along with many of my other YouTube videos, were shot using one of these lights. That includes all of the B-roll, some of which you're seeing now. And also, here's a selection of real quick tabletop photographs I also took with this light. The power was set to 65% and the frosted fuser was attached, which as I demonstrated earlier in the video, does knock the power output down by about half or one stop. And as you can see, there's still plenty bright enough. There's certainly bright enough and will be ideal if you're looking to set up a home YouTube studio, as well as taking some thumbnails or maybe some product photos or videos and that sort of thing. So let's flick this round and actually have a look at the interface. Now, in my opinion, a few of these things aren't really necessary on a lighting kit of this price aimed for this market. So you've got V-Lock battery mounts here, which are batteries which are very powerful but they're big and chunky and more importantly, they're expensive. So you can take these lights out with you and do shoot wherever you want if you want to buy some V-Lock batteries. I think the cheapest I've been able to find some online are about £100. Personally, I would prefer to see mounts with these style batteries. These are Sony NP style batteries. Not only are they smaller, easier to find, they're also considerably cheaper. Yes, they're not as powerful. You will need to swap out batteries more, but they're just easier to get hold of and don't cost a small fortune to buy. If you're a professional and you have a load of the V-Lock batteries, then it may be of useful to you, but for your everyday consumer, I think it's a bit overkill. Now, I can actually say the same thing about these DMX in and DMX out. Now, if you've not heard of DMX, he's a rapper that was popular in the two. Ah, just kidding. That's a different DMX. DMX actually stands for digital multiplex. What it means is you can daily chain a bunch of lights together in, say, a studio setup, connect them to a light desk or console, and then you can control all your lights from one place. Which then takes us back to the DMX and the channel buttons at the top, unless you're using the DMX in and out, then they're pretty unnecessary. They're pretty relevant. You don't need to worry too much about them. They're just there so you can choose the different channels when you're doing your DMX to make sure that it all talks back to your console and that sort of thing. Back to the things that do matter. We've got our white balance reading here. What's really nice is it's nice and smooth. It's actually quite a nice dampen. It's a metal knob as well. It feels quite nice to use. You can adjust the white balance in 100 Kelvin increments. We're currently set to 5600K. We can go to 5500K, 5453, all the way down. There's no big jumps. Sometimes with LED panels, as soon as you go from 5600K, which is all of our 300, 5600K bulbs, as soon as we go down one to 5500, you can see a big step as those orange bulbs kick in. But hopefully you can tell from the background here, there's not a big step. It's just a real small increment as we go from 5600 to 5500, which is a nice touch. Now the power dial can go in 1% increments. I'm currently at 100%. I can go down to just 99, and we can just have it on 1% if we want to. Again, we can have that 1% all the way throughout the white balance range. We've got our power switch, which is a real simple on and off. Nothing fancy about that. And then we do have our power input here. And then lastly, let's just talk about this LED panel. It's relatively easy to see. It's nothing complicated. It's just a pretty bog standard LED panel. But one thing I will mention is when you have it quite high and you're looking at it from a low angle, the viewing angles aren't great. So it sometimes can be a little bit difficult to see what power you're on. In terms of heat and noise, there are none because it's an LED panel. You don't really get much heat. That means there's no need for a fan, which basically means it's pretty much silent. I've been using them in all my videos, and you can't hear any sort of wine or any sort of electronic noises or anything like that. They are pretty much silent no matter what power or white balance you use. In terms of heat, again, they are pretty much heat free. You've got all these holes on the back of the construction, which I assume was for heat dissipation. But I don't think you really need them at all because it doesn't produce much heat. I've used these lights for hours upon hours with no issues whatsoever. Now, as mentioned throughout this video, I have been using these lights for pretty much all of my YouTube videos for the past couple of months. If you want to go back and have a look, nearly all of them have been lit with a single one of these LED light panels. And I have an occasion been using one of these in the background as well as a rim or hair light on the back. I have also had the opportunity to take these out and use them on an actual page shoot where I took some video of a guitarist friend of mine. Again, I took one of these with me and I used it as a really nice rim light just to help bring my subject away from the background a little bit. And again, they were flawless. Plugged them in, left them on for a few hours with no issues whatsoever. Because I wanted relatively soft light, I didn't actually use one of these as my main. I used a different light, but these works really well as that rim or hair light in the background. So overall, personally, I'm a really big fan of them. They've been working really well. They've been totally reliable and they produce nice consistent, soft enough light for me. If you don't have the room to have the lights quite close, they're going to be quite far away, then they may start to become a little bit harsh because they're relatively small. You may be better off looking like a Carbostyle LED with a nice big modifier to really soften the light. But if you can get the light quite close to you like I have here, then it actually produces really quite nice aesthetically pleasing light. And I personally think the price is really quite nice. £329 in the UK for a two light kit with light stands to fuses, power cables and everything is really quite a good offer. Now are there cheaper kits out there? Yes, potentially if you shopped around, you may be able to find something a little bit cheaper. But as a one click sort of kit to get you up and running, I think they're pretty good buy. And that's pretty much it for this one. If you enjoyed this video, do give me a thumbs up.
