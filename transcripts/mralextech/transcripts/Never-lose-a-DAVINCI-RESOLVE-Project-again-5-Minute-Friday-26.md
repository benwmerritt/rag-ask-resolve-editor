What up folks, it's Alex here and welcome back to 5 minute Friday. Now this week isn't quite as exciting, it's a practical one but it could really save your bacon if DaVinci Resolve decides to crash on you during the middle of a project. So what we're going to look at is the Live Save feature and Project Backups. Now the Live Save feature does exactly what it says on the tin, it saves your project after every single change. So if you add a file to your timeline it will save for you. If you add some colour grading it will save, go into Fusion, Save, Cut, Sound Effects, Music, anything you do after every single step it will automatically save your project. So if DaVinci Resolve does decide to crash you can just load the project up and it will be in exactly the same position you left off. And then you've got Project Backups. Now they are very similar but they are set to intervals rather than being after every single change. So you can set how many backups you want within an hour for example. So it's actually set to be every 10 minutes. So you'll get 6 backups every hour. You can then choose how many hourly backups you want to take. So maybe you want to hold 8 hourly backups so there's a backup for every hour you've worked for the past 8 hours and you can also do it in days as well. So with these project backups and with the Live Save hopefully you'll never ever lose an important project again. So this is only a quick one so let's open DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you how it's done. So here we are folks we're in DaVinci Resolve and we're on the Edit tab. Now you can actually be on basically any tab, doesn't matter which and then you go and go up into the top left hand corner where it says DaVinci Resolve and then selecting Preferences. This window will appear. At the top you've got System and User so click on User and then from this menu on the left select the Project, Save and Load. Then in these Save settings here you've got a tick box for Live Save. So to turn Live Save on it's simply tick that box and then hit Save and that's it. That's all we need to do to get Live Save up and running. And then the same for your project backups. So we've got a Project Backups tick box here. We can just activate or deactivate that. Once it's activated you've got a few options. So if we just skip down to the bottom here, this is the location for your backups. So make sure you put somewhere where there's a reasonable amount of room. You don't need too much because these are actually self-clear. It won't just create hundreds and hundreds of backups. It'll only allow for a certain amount. And then here you can change the intervals. So perform backups every 10 minutes. So if we do 10 that will hold 6 backups per hour. So after one hour it will then start overwriting the original backup. So you'll only ever have 6 backups. Hourly backups for the past 2 hours. We can change that to say hourly backups for the past 8 hours. And the maximum you'll ever have is 8 hourly backups. So again it won't take up loads and loads of storage space. And then you've got daily backups for the past 2 days. Again the maximum you'll hold there is 2 or whatever you set that to. Once you're done, hit save. And that's it. That's those activated. So LiveSafe will just start working straight away. Whenever you're in a project you make a change. It will automatically save the project for you. But to access your project backups, what you actually need to do is head to your project manager. So I'm just going to click on file and project manager here. Or if you're opening DaVinci Resolve from scratch, this is the first thing that you'll see when you load DaVinci Resolve. Click on the project that you're interested in. And we're going to right click. And we're going to go to project backups. And in here there'll be a list of the project backups that have been saved. So you can see this one was saved today at 8.57 and this one was at 8.47. And then if I was just to click on this one here, I can then load or delete. So I can load into that backup and job them. And if I just hit refresh, it'll just refresh this list to see if another has been created. And that's it folks. Easy as that. Turn your LiveSafe on and your project backups and hopefully you'll never ever lose a project again. Thanks for watching. Hope you enjoyed the video. If you did, thumbs up.
