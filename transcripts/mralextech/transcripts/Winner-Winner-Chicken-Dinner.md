What up folks, it's Alex here. How are you all doing? Hope you're good. Sorry I haven't been around on the channel for a little while. I had a few days break just to sort a few things out, add some personal things to sort out and that turned into a two week break, which is not my intention. I'm all good though, I'm all well, nothing wrong with me. Just ended up having a longer break than I expected. But I'm back, I'm gonna start pumping out some content for this channel as soon as I can. So ideally, gonna try and get a few videos out this week and then we'll carry it on from there. So this is just a real quick video to let you know that yes, I am back. I will be posting some more videos and I have a winner to announce. So February was the first time running a competition on the Mr. Alex Tech channel, as you well know. It was for a DaVinci Resolve studio license. And we have a winner. Someone managed to get two first comments throughout the month, which doesn't sound like many, but there were lots of people commenting to actually getting to is pretty good going. Anyway, the winner. That's my best drum roll. Jai-Ear Mendoza. Hopefully I'm pronouncing that right. Jai-Ear, I think that's right. If I've butchered your name, I'm really apologized dude. I didn't mean to. That's the best I can do. But yeah, Jai-Ear Mendoza is the first winner of the Mr. Alex Tech competition. I've already contacted him on Instagram and I will be sending out the license to ASAP so you can get cracking with DaVinci Resolve studio. Thanks to everyone that took part. I think it was a good bit of fun. No one seems to take it too seriously. There was lots of people trying to get the first, but some people were just a bit too quick. The competition seems to be really well received. I don't know that everyone was a fan of the first idea, but running competitions on this channel is, I think, a good idea. It seems to work well. People seem to enjoy it and I get to give something back. So yeah, we'll do another one. I haven't yet figured out what I'm going to do for March, but I'll probably just pick a random comment over the next couple of videos for the winner for the March competition and then I'll try and get something set in stone, something a little more concrete going forward from April and beyond. I also haven't yet picked up a prize for this month. So if you've got any ideas, let me know down in the comment section below. I think generally I'm going to stick to software. I'm going to stick to digital downloads and that sort of thing just because it's way, way easier. Certain things, obviously, I can't post around the globe. I could maybe look at some vouchers, Amazon stuff, but again, not everyone has Amazon. So software stuff for DaVinci Resolve or any sort of editing bits and bobs, that sort of stuff. Maybe a few subscriptions to some music sites or stock footage, that sort of thing. I think that'll work really well. But yeah, let me know down in the comments section below if you've got any thoughts or ideas or whatever. So that's it for this one. I just really wanted to get back in front of the camera, get talking again because when you stop, the hardest thing is getting going again. So this is a real quick video just to get me going. And then hopefully I can carry on with some cool Mr. Alex Tech goodness throughout the rest of the week and the rest of the year and beyond. Please do let me know how you're doing down in the comment section below. I haven't spoke to you a bunch of yet for a couple of weeks, so it'd be nice to see how everyone's doing, especially you regulars that are around commenting in this comment section every week or so. Let me know how you're doing. I hope you're all staying safe. Give me a thumbs up, comment, subscribe. No one's gonna subscribe to this video. But yeah, you know what I mean. Take it easy, I'll catch you next time. See ya.
