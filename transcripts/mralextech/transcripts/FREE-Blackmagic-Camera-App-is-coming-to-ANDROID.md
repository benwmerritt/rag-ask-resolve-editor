What up folks, it's Alex here. How are you all doing? So I'm here at NAB in Las Vegas and we've got the Blackmagic stand right behind me. There's obviously some cool stuff going on with the ventures of 19 and everything else. But there is some other news which hasn't made it online yet. It's a bit of an exclusive just for NAB. Now, this video is slightly different. I'm doing this all in one take. So, you know, might be a few mistakes, but let me show you. So, as you may or may not already know, there is a Blackmagic app for iPhone. It came out, I don't know, last year sometime, and it allows you to record, with set your frame rates and your FPS and everything, but using the Blackmagic interface on iPhones. Now, as soon as that came out, the first thing everyone said was, where's the Android version? Well, da-na-na-na-na. Here it is. This is the Blackmagic app running on Android. So, this is brand new. It's not out yet. We don't know when it's gonna be coming out. It's still kind of in beta. It's being tested, but this is the Blackmagic app running on Android. So, this is a Pixel Pro, I believe, and they've got it over there running on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, something or other. And it works even exactly the same way. So, you can choose the lenses. You've got your frame rates, shutter speed, white balance, tint, everything on here. You've got your histograms. It will record. Don't actually know whether it will do external recording. I assume it will. We're gonna ask the question. And, you have all of the same on-screen displays. You can get your full screen, Instagrams, you can do all that sort of stuff. We can switch over to media. We've got all of the media. The cloud sync will work from here as well. So, you can get this to upload all your files to the cloud so that when you actually get to the venture resolve on your computer, everything's synced up and you're good to go. So, that's all coming on there. Obviously, you've got your chat and then we've got settings and you can change all this sort of stuff as well. Let me go back to the camera. That's all. Let's do it on here. There you go. Boop, boop, boop. Looking good. So, it's coming. The Blackmagic Camera app is coming to Android. So, all of you Android lovers, like me, I shoot on Android. I'm an Android kind of guy. We can finally get the same thing. Now, a few things. Obviously, there won't be like Apple Lug. Apple Lug is obviously only for Apple. That's going to record in H.264, H.265 and AV1. That's all I know so far from having a very quick conversation asking you about that. And the only other thing to mention, one of the biggest issues, one of the problems why it's taken them so long to get it on Android is because every device is different. There's no uniformity between the devices. Some people can be shooting on one phone and someone shooting on another. So, what they're actually going to do is just release this initially for a handful of devices. I don't exactly know how this is going to work. They won't give me too much information. But essentially, it'll be on the Play Store, but you'll have to have a certain level of phone to be able to download it initially because everyone does colour science different and all the cameras are different and all the chips are different, the hardware is different, the software is different, all that sort of thing. So, what they're going to do is release it initially for a handful of devices and then over time, they'll introduce more and more compatibility with older devices or different manufacturers and this sort of thing. They've got it running at the minute on the Google Pixel Pro, as mentioned, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra. I don't know whether they'll be the first things that it comes out on and then I'll add more later. We don't know. However, it's coming. It's confirmed. Later in the year, potentially at some point, you'll be able to download the Blackmagic Camera on Android, which is good news indeed. So, that's it. I just wanted to hop on, give you a bit of an exclusive, let you know it's coming. If you're keen, if you're interested, if you want to know more, let me know down in the comments below. I might try and have a bit of a chat with them. I'll see if I can get a little bit more information. I don't think they're going to tell me too much, to be honest. It's quite secretive because it's not out yet, but it's good news either way. So, I'm going to go find Darren and Casey because we're going to go for a bit of a wonder and soak up the rest of NAB. So, thanks for watching. Take it easy. I'll see you next time.
