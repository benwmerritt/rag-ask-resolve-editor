What up folks, it's Alex here. Hope you're all well on this fine Tuesday evening. Now following on from my last five minute Friday video where I showed you how to do the multicam and the audio sync with individual resolve, I've had a question. Now the question comes in from someone called 50 millimeter. So thank you very much first of all for watching the video and asking the question. It's appreciated. And they ask, how do you do the multicam if you either have no audio or really poor audio? And that's what we're gonna have a real quick look at in this video today. I've got two cameras set up. Now this one has the mic on and is recorded in audio. This one has no sound at all. I've purposely disabled the micro. So that's not recording anything at all. Now good practice with an audio sync is creating a spike basically. So you see YouTubers do all the time, they clap and that creates a spike in the audio. So then the sync has sort of a base, it has an area to start working from. Now if you're trying to sync without any audio, you still wanna do the same thing, but rather than it being an audio cue, it's gonna be a visual cue so then you can line them up. So what I advise, making sure that both cameras can see something, and doing an action, doing something really sharp and you can use that as your visual cue to line up your two video files. You don't wanna just be guessing and trying to line up lips because that's gonna be really hard. You want a real distinctive something to have you line your clips up. So make sure you do that while you're recording. Once you've done that, get it in Resolve and I'll show you now how to line them up. So here we are in DaVinci Resolve. Now we're in the Media tab and I've set all my project settings so we're all ready to go. Now these are the two clips that I'm gonna use, so I'm just gonna highlight them and add them to my media pool. Now just to show you this video here, in the background, has audio whereas this one has none at all, it's completely silent. Now that doesn't actually matter. Doesn't matter whether both clips have sound, neither have sound, the sound is there but rubbish, it doesn't matter because we're not gonna use the audio at all. What we're actually gonna do is simply set a marker which Resolve is going to align which will synchronize the two clips. So the first step is to find that visual cue in both of the clips. So I'm gonna start with this one here. Now, general advice, do your visual cue at the beginning of the video makes your life easier. I didn't so I've gotta go through and find it. It doesn't matter really but it will make your life a little bit easier if you do it at the beginning. Now I'm gonna use this clamp here because it's really short, sharp and precise so I can find the exact point. So I'm just gonna use the left and right arrow keys to go frame by frame and find the exact point I clapped which is right there. My hands are completely clashed at that exact point. Now on this timeline, I'm just gonna right click, I'm gonna add a marker and I'm gonna choose a color. Doesn't matter which, I'm gonna stick with blue. And I'll put a little time code up here, five minutes 13. Now I'm gonna go to my second clip and do the exact same thing. So find the exact same point. And here it is. So same thing, gonna use my left arrow key to go back frame by frame. And there you go, that's the exact same point on this second clip. Now I'm just gonna right click, add a marker and blue. This one is at five minutes and seven seconds. And there you go, you can see the little marker on the timeline. Now, if I highlight both these clips in the media pool, right click and I'm gonna create a new multi-cam clip using selected clips. I can give it a name if I want to or leave it as is. And in the angle of sync, I'm gonna select the drop down and I'm gonna go to marker. And then I'm gonna click create. Now both the two original clips will go in this original clips folder and you'll end up with a multi-cam. Now I'm just gonna go to the edit page. I'm gonna grab my multi-cam and drag it onto my timeline, the same as you usually would. Now at this point, you just wanna make sure that you can see both these two preview windows. If you only see one, like this, you need to make sure that you click on this icon up here to make sure that you see both. And then over on the left hand side, there's this icon with a drop down. Give that a click and then click on multi-cam. And then you'll see both your angle one and angle two in this window here. I'm just gonna go back to the timeline. And as you can see, it's selected angle one for the duration. So there's no audio, because there's no audio on angle one. And then we've got angle one throughout. Now what I suggest doing here is select your primary for both. So the one that you're probably gonna use the most. So I'm gonna right click on my video one. Gonna go to switch, multi-cam, clip angle. I'm gonna change this to angle two. Because that's my predominant angle, that's the one I'll use the most. Now I'm gonna do the same thing on my audio. Because that's the one that has the audio. So I've changed that to angle two. Now, if I hit play, two, even in. Now I've got a question. And everything's playing as normal. Now there's three icons here. This one allows you to cut just the video. This one will cut the video and audio. And this one will just cut the audio. Now because I've only got audio on one of my clips, so I don't actually care about the other audio clip. So all I want to do is click on this icon here. So I only have a chop and change between the video files and not the audio. Now what you can do is if I hit space to play through. One of those is Alex here. And at any point I can just pause by hitting the space bar again. And then I can click on angle one. And it will put a cut in the timeline. And it will change the angle. Then if I hit space, I hope you're all doing well on this fine Tuesday evening. It will play through again using the different angles. You can then repeat this process all the way through your video. What's it do? Yeah. It's a chop and change between the angles. And that's how you do multi-cam. If that was useful, obviously thumbs up for me please. Comment below any questions at all. And make sure you subscribe so you can catch the next Five Minute Friday. Cheers folks.
