This is Sparta! Memes! More memes again this week folks. Now I know. It probably looks a little bit silly. It is a bit silly, really. But messing around creating fun little memes like this can actually teach you quite a lot about using keyframes. And basically all animation within DaVinci Resolve is done using keyframes so it's quite an important skill to learn. So let's open up DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you how to do it. So here we are within DaVinci Resolve and we're currently on the edit tab. Now before we get into it I just want to show you really quickly how these keyframes work. So I'm going to grab this logo here, put it on my timeline and then I'm just going to use the inspector, top right hand corner, we'll make this a little bit smaller and then we're going to put this over the far left hand side like so. Then we're going to move my playhead to the far left and then these little dots here allow us to add keyframes. So the dots on the right of the transform area and if we give that a click it will go red. So that's marked that at this point where our playhead is we want this logo to be in this position. Then if we move our playhead forwards, so let's just go to about here, let's say at this three second mark we want this logo to be over here, we just move it over there, we come back to the beginning and hit play and now we've got a basic animation. You only need to tell DaVinci Resolve they start and end points and they will automatically fill in the gap for you. So we've just with a couple of clicks we've animated this logo so that it moves from the left to the right of the screen like so. And that applies to any of the options within here, zooms, position, rotation, pitch, yours and that sort of thing. And that's the basic fundamentals of animation in DaVinci Resolve and that's what we're going to use to do our stupid meme. So let's just delete that. In my media pool I've got the clip that we're going to use and then we've got my three logos. All of the logos are PNG files and they do have transparent backgrounds. It's much easier if you can find a PNG with a transparent background because then you don't need to do any messing around. So I'm going to add my clip to my timeline like so and I just need to cut this down because it's too long and I'm not going to be using all of this. So I'm just going to delete any of the bits that we don't need. So with that done, what I like to do then add cuts to the clips wherever the scene changes. So I'm going to just hit play. We're going to wait until there's a change in the scene. So here it cuts from the one guy to the other. We use our left and right arrow keys just to go back and then we'll do a control B to add a little cut on this. And now we've got two clips on our timeline. It just makes life way easier when you're adding your logos. You know exactly how long they need to be. We'll hit play and there we go. We'll do another there and we'll just go through the whole thing making any cuts that we need to until we're happy. And then you'll end up with something that looks like this. So then we can start to add our logos. So this first one, we've got this guy just to replace his face with the DaVinci Resolve. So I'm going to grab my DaVinci Resolve logo and I'm going to put it above my video clip on track number two on the timeline and then I'm just going to resize it to be the same length of this first scene like so. Then move our playhead to the very far left. So it's right over to the edge here. Within the inspector, you don't need to add your keyframe yet. Just resize this to be exactly in the place that you want it. So I'm just going to put it above his guy's face like so until we're happy. And then from here, add the keyframe by clicking on this icon in the top right hand corner. That one will add a keyframe to all of these options so you can just change any option you want to and it will animate it for you. And then we're going to hit play. Now what we're looking for is big obvious movements. You don't need to do it frame by frame. So at this point here is head sort of changes direction. So we're just going to then press pause, move this over a little bit and then we hit play again. It's come back over to the left. So I'll pause it and just move this back over to the left and we'll hit play. I just go back over to the right again. So we'll go back over to the right and then a little bit more towards the end. And there we go. And then if we go back and hit play now, we've got this real basic keyframed tracking. And then it goes to this guy. So this guy we need our Premiere Pro. So we're just going to put that on there, lengthen that down, make sure I have playhead is over to the far left. Give it a click, resize it, get it exactly where we want it for this guy. We'll hit the keyframe, we'll hit play. He doesn't really move too much. He's moving a little bit, so we'll move this over and then he cuts back again. So we're going back to our DaVinci Resolve. And then all you need to do is continue to repeat this process for all of your different sections. Now, here I've got this bit where I want my two logos. So what I need to do, do the exact same thing. We grab my DaVinci Resolve one. We'll put that on track number two like so. We'll resize it. Get it in the position that we want it. We'll go with something like that. We'll hit our keyframe, we'll play. This bit's really quick, so I'm going to use my left and my arrow keys again. He's coming forward there, so we're going to move that over to the right. A couple of frames, we'll move that back again here and up a little bit. Back a bit more, play. I think he stays pretty much there from now on. And now we need to do the exact same thing for our Premiere Pro. So we're going to grab our Premiere Pro logo, put it above the other two. Now we've got three video tracks. Same thing again, put our playhead to the far left, resize it, move it to the position we need it. This time we're going to add a bit of an angle to it. Keyframe, hit play. There's a sharp movement there, so let's change the angle and move it over. Play again. He's all the way down there now, so we'll move him over and down. Play again. So now if we play that little scene, easy peasy. Quick face replacement to make some memes using basic, simple keyframes. And that's it for this week. I hope you did enjoy this video.
