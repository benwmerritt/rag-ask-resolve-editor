Quick tips! I blum in love a quick tip and I haven't talked about quick tips in ages. These are tips I love in DaVinci Resolve. Tips to help you save time, tips to make you look cool, and tips to make you better in bed. Not that last one, we're not going to jump into that. But they are some pretty cool handy dandy little tips for DaVinci Resolve. Now I do need to let you know this video is sponsored by Motion VFX, but we'll come back to those in a minute. First up, let's get started with the Proxy Generator. If you've never used Proxies before, Proxies are like a smaller, easier to edit version of your main clips. They can make working in Resolve much, much easier and smoother. You don't even need to go into DaVinci Resolve to create your Proxies because if you've installed DaVinci Resolve, free or studio, you will have also installed the DaVinci Resolve Proxy Generator. So we don't even need to have DaVinci Resolve open. All we need to do, we click on start, we go to all apps because my window's 11. Then we go to the black magic design folder. And within there, you will see the black magic proxy generator. Give that a click and the proxy generator will open. You can choose your format. We've got an eight bit 420, half res 1080p, or we've got a 265 10 bit 1080p. So you can just pick whichever one you want. The top one will be the lightest, the bottom will be slightly heavier. Then bottom left, we click add to find the folder where we want to generate our proxies. So I've added my folder, it currently says waiting, then we're simply going to hit start. And then it'll run through all of the individual clips within that folder, generating our proxies. And as you can see, it's pretty quick. Once we're done, it will say completed, and that's it proxies generated. Then with DaVinci Resolve open, if we import any of that footage into literally any project going forward, it will automatically have this little proxy icon on there. And we can work off the proxies, which are lighter and easier to run in the top right hand corner. There's a little drop down, we can select a prefer proxies, or we can disable the proxies, in which case we'll be using the originals. But it's really handy to be able to edit using the proxies. And then when you deliver the project at the end, it will automatically use the full resolution original files. Proxy generator, super useful, you can leave it going, go put the kettle on, grab a cup of coffee, come back, and they'll be ready to go. Next up, this is a silly one, it's an easy one, but I had to include it. Closing projects. All you do, you click on file, and you can close the project. I know, seems silly, right? But it's easy to miss. The alternative is you can click on the little house icon bottom right hand corner to open up the project manager. I've got this one here, the current one open, we simply right click, and then we can close it down, just like so. I know, it seems silly, but for a long time, I would actually just exit out of DaVinci Resolve, because I didn't actually know how to close the individual projects down. So I wanted to include that one. Dynamic project switching. This is me being dynamic. If you need to be jumping back and forth between different projects, enable the dynamic project switching. So with the project manager open, like I've got here, we right click any empty space, and we enable the dynamic project. Switching. Then if we open this one project, this one's going to be open, but we can open up our project manager, open up one of our other projects, and now we can simply jump back and forth between them. At the very top, you'll see the name of your current project, and now there's a little drop down button. And we can switch between the currently open projects. It's really quick and easy. It's also really handy because I can grab any footage from this project, like this clip on the timeline, do a quick copy, jump onto the other project, do a quick paste, and it's a nice handy way of putting assets from one project over to the other. Color management. Color management is not a quick tip. Generally speaking, it's quite an in-depth process. But if you're like me, you're a bit of a mugging, so it just puts random things on YouTube and isn't that worried about gamma 2.4 versus gamma point, whatever, you just need to really quickly import some V-Log or log footage from your camera or whatever. It needs to go to Rec 709 because you're going to dump it on YouTube. Color management really isn't that complicated. So let me just show you really quickly what I do for any projects where I'm using log footage. And I promise you, it's simpler than you probably expect. So here we are in a new project. Now I'm going to click on my little cog, my gear, bottom right hand corner to open up my project settings. And then we're going to go to the color management. And I'm going to change the color science to be DaVinci YRGB color managed. And then we're going to leave it with automatic color management. We're not doing any HDR, so it's going to be SDR. And we're not doing anything other than SDR 709. So we'll leave that exactly as it is, and then hit save. Now this footage I've got imported here. This was shot with my Panasonic Lumix S5. And it's all in VLog. So you can see it's kind of washed out, looks low contrast. So we want to just convert this to 709 so that it looks nicer. And then we can do some grading on it if we want to. Now the easiest way to do this, jump over to the media page, you can select all the footage within your media pool. You simply right click. And there's an option to input the color space. Then I can choose Panasonic V gamut V log. Done. And then if I jump on to the edit page, as I'm editing before I've done anything, as soon as I drop on the timeline, it's all standardized to 709. So it all looks pretty good. And we can do the edit, we can do all the usual stuff with it actually looking quite nice. Then we can still jump over to the color page. And we can do our color grading if we want to. And we don't need to mess around with any LUT or color space transforms. Sweet footage graded kind of not really, but at least it looks decent. So then you can start doing the rest of what you need to do. Now if the footage is running a little bit slowly on your timeline, you should have created the proxies using the proxy generator. But if you didn't, there is another option. And it's the timeline proxy resolution. It's a super quick and easy way to knock the resolution down within the vintage resolve, which can help to speed things up. All you do, you click on playback at the very top. And then we go timeline proxy resolution. There's three options, full, half or quarter. And all it's doing is it's looking at this preview window here. And currently that's playing at full resolution. But if we change that to be half, now that's playing back at half resolution. Now most of the time, especially if you've got that preview window, pretty small, you probably won't even notice, especially if you're working on the laptop. If I was to change that even further to go to quarter, we may then start to see it may start to look a little bit fuzzy, but it will improve performance. So if you're struggling with frames, that's a real quick way of getting just a few extra FPS so you can edit just a little bit smoother. Boom, we're ready to start editing. So what I tend to do is I will lay down my a roll track, I'll cut everything together, my main narrative, and then I need to add my b-roll, all of my additional footage. And the best way to do that is using the source tape. The source tape exists on the cut page. So even if you hate the cut page, go into the cut page and try using the source tape, because it's really, really handy. So I'm on the edit page, I've kind of cut together, I haven't really cut anything because it's a demo, but imagine I've cut together this a roll here, and then I've got a b-roll folder, and I want to go through my b-roll and drop it under my timeline. I could individually open up all of these clips, and then grab the bits that I want to put them on my timeline, but I haven't got time for that. I could also create a separate timeline and stack them all up, but again, that's effort. So instead, what we're going to do, jump over to the cut page, you can see I've got my main timeline down here, make sure we're in that b-roll folder, and then in the preview window here, just above, there's this icon, source tape, and it's going to stack all of that footage into one big, long timeline, so I can really quickly scrub through it, grab the footage that I want, and then drag it onto my timeline. Now you can really quickly hit Q to jump back and forth between the source tape and the timeline. So let's say I want this bit here, I'm going to use an I and an O, I can just drag this down, put it on my timeline, hit Q, this is now my timeline viewer, hit Q once again, we're now back in the source tape. And if I want to have a look at any of these clips in finer detail, let's say this one here, I can hit shift and Q, and now we're in this individual clip. And I can once again find the section that I want, drag it onto my timeline, I can hit Q to jump to the source and the timeline, or when I've got the source open, hit shift and Q to jump back into the source tape. And then once again, go through all the other clips, checking the bits that we want dropping on the timeline without having to open up clips one after another. And my next quick tip is to take a look at this video sponsor, MotionVFX. I've used MotionVFX for ages now, I've made a few videos in the past, and I'm still using them to this day. Very recently, I've made a few review style videos, there's one of this ZenBook over here, and of course there is my recent video about the new micro color panel. All of the titles, all of the pop out texts, all of the infographics, all that sort of stuff are from MotionVFX. They look great, they're easy to use, and they save me a ton of time when it comes to putting these projects together. I've been using the M product, which is full of calls to action, infographics, logos, and titles and different typography, and I've been using the M review, which is another one of my favorites. They've also been really busy adding a bunch of really cool, really bespoke presets. There's things like M Science, M Style, VCR, which I really like because who doesn't love this retro VCR kind of look. There's M Storytelling and M Style Cinematic. Click the link down in the description below to go check out that full range of presets that are available for DaVinci Resolve. Thank you very much, MotionVFX. Next up, Multi Text Formatting. You can change the colors and the fonts and the styles of text within a single text title. Not text plus, it has to be a standard text, but it's a really quick and handy tip that everyone needs to know, and it's quite easy to miss. You can also do snapping, which loads of people miss that as well. Let me show you. We're back on the edit page. I'm going to open up the Effects Library. We're going to go to Titles and we're simply going to grab the standard text, not text plus, but the standard text. Drop it on your timeline, give it a click, and then open the Inspector. Now, I can type anything in here. This is actually my mate called Rich Watson. Rich Watson Music. Here's a guitarist. He's got a YouTube channel. I've put his details down below, and we can just type all the stuff in here. Now, obviously, changing all of these attributes just changes everything within this box. But if we highlight just the word guitarist and then change the tracking, the size, we can even change the font, the color, we can do all the sort of stuff on the individual text. If we then highlight the Rich Watson, let's maybe increase the size of this, change the tracking, we'll change this to be all caps, and you can just mess around with the individual text. Just remember that if you do that, but then don't have anything highlighted and change one of the attributes, it will change it for every single thing. Oh yeah, nearly forgot. Snapping. If you've got one of these standard text titles put on your timeline, make sure you don't have any of these selected so you haven't got the transform on. We just toggle that off so nothing is on with our preview. You can then click on the text and you can move it around. And the snapping. And it's the only place, the only thing as far as I know, which has snapping. You can also just kind of the size, you can click and drag, and you can do the rotation, move around, and it will snap into place. So there you go. Snapping. Sweet. Next up, color, grading, presets. This is again something I use in literally every single one of these talking head videos that I do, although sometimes I get bored and tweak it, but generally speaking, I use the same one. And to do it, I have a color grading preset, although technically not called a preset, it's actually a still and you put the still in an area called power grades. But it's the same thing, which you've done any sort of color grade, you can save all of that stuff into a power grade, which is a preset. And then any project you open within that library within that database, you can really quickly apply the same color grade in just a handful of clicks super quick and easy. So I'm on the color page, and I've set up this really simple color grade. So there's three nodes on here. It actually doesn't matter how many nodes you've got, this will work for any. And then if we open up the gallery, which is in the top left hand corner, we've got stills. Now stills are just the stills from this current project. So if I was to right click on my actual preview window, there's an option to grab a still, that'll put the still within here. Now, if I was to reset this grade, so there's nothing on there at all. And then in this still, we can right click, and we can apply the grade. And it'll dump the color grade that was on at the time we took the still onto our current clip. If you've got a mouse with a clickable scroll wheel, which you should have, if you're in the vintage resolve, I highly recommend it, we can simply click that in, and it will do the exact same thing. Now, if you want to be able to do that across all of your future projects within this current database, if we go to power grade, you can actually see some I made earlier, do the exact same thing, right click and grab still. And this grade, this power grade, this still will be available in all of the projects that you open up within this next up, Fairlight configuration presets, aka these little drop down presets that you can make available every single time you create a new timeline, which means you don't need to set up your audio tracks every single time. This one is an absolute blinder. Let's have a look. So all you need to do create a new timeline or go to one of your existing timelines, anything you like, that's got some audio tracks on like this, I can go and give them a name. Let's say this one is my chatty one, and this one is for my music. I can't type apparently. And then we can come in and we can change the volume, we can set the dialogue level and maybe we can do any of the Fairlight stuff that we need to do, either directly on Fairlight or just on the edit page. Once you're done, once you're happy, once your audio is all set up, jump to Fairlight, click on Fairlight at the very top, and then click on presets library. From this filter by drop down, click on that and then select the Fairlight configuration presets. And as you can see, I've already created a few, you probably won't have any here, then we're simply going to click on create new. If prompted by this box, click create new once again, and I'm going to call this one demo, and then click on okay. Now at any point in future projects, you can open this presets library, come to the Fairlight configuration presets, click demo, and then simply click apply. But the killer feature is now whenever we create a new timeline within the edit page, it's going to ask us if we want to use a Fairlight preset. And if we do, we tick the box, we get the Fairlight presets option, we click the drop down, I can select demo or any of my other presets that I want to use, click to create. And this brand new timeline will have all of the audio tracks that we created with names with volumes with compressors with all the audio effects, everything already set and ready to go. Winner duplicate your timeline. How many times have you thought you had a brilliant idea to you've messed about spent half an hour doing a new reedit of your timeline, only to realize you're an idiot and it was better before. Yeah, I do it all the time. Now the venture resolve does have things like backups and live save. And of course, you've got undo controls ed. But a really good habit to get into really good practice is if you're having one of those pivotal moments where you're like, I'm going to change the entire timeline because I've got a cool idea. Just duplicate your timeline first, or you do find the timeline within the media poll, right click, and then click duplicate timeline. You can even set a keyboard shortcut to do exactly that. I actually like control D for duplicate. And I know what you're thinking, control D on the timeline brings up your clip length. It does. But some of the keyboard shortcuts in the venture resolve can be assigned to different things, depending on what you currently have active. So when I'm on the timeline, control D will open my clip duration. But if I'm in my media poll, and I have something selected and I control D, it will do a duplicate. It's handy. To set this up, we simply click on DaVinci resolve top left hand corner, we go to the keyboard customization. And we simply go search for duplicate. You've got one here called media pool. Within there, there's duplicate item. I've set the keyboard shortcut to be control and D. And that's it. We've done loads of the editing stuff now. Now it's time to export. So simply from the deliver page, we just set the settings to whatever we want them to be. So let's just say I'm happy with all of this. Another bonus tip while we're here, click on audio, open up this audio normalization, tick this box, and there is a standard box here. Open this dropdown. And for you, YouTubers like me, there is an option to set the loudness, set the audio normalization specifically for YouTube. Once that's all done, and you're happy with this preset, we simply click on the three little dots at the top right hand corner. And we save as a new preset. I'll call this one demo, click on okay. And then it will appear on this little list at the very top, like so. So whenever we want to export with these settings, we just click demo and we're good to go. Now the other benefit, once you've set up one of those exports presets, you can actually set a project to go to the render queue directly from the edit page. So I'm going to go to this timeline one in my media pool, we're going to right click, and we're going to go to timelines, add to render queue using, and now my demo option is there. So I'll give that a click. Then if we jump to the deliver page, it's already in my render queue ready to go. Noice. And last but not least, render page queuing and swapping timelines. Another way to do kind of what we've just talked about is if you want to dump loads of different timelines into your render queue, so that you can render them all in one big go, you can actually do it all directly from the deliver page. So this one here is called 1080p, this timeline. And if we have a look at the video settings, it is of course 1080p. So we're going to add this to the render queue. Now we don't need to hop out of the deliver page. What we can do is simply click on this little drop down at the top and jump to one of the other timelines. This project currently has three. So we're going to go to 720p. Now all of the project settings are going to stay exactly the same, except for the resolution and the frame rate, if it is of course different from the project we just had open, which in my case, the resolution is different. So it's changed. Then you probably want to give it a new name. I'm going to call this one 720. So then we're going to add that to the render queue. Then we can either make sure none of them are selected and the option will say render all and it will render them all out sequentially, or we can click and highlight the ones we want and then render that way instead. Simple. Quick tips. Thank you for motion VFX for sponsoring this video. Make sure to check them out. Thank you for watching. I salute you. Goodbye. I'll see you next time. Pew, pew, pew.
