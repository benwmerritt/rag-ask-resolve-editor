This probably isn't what you think it is. And yes, I'm running it on an iPad because I don't have an iPhone. At the recent Blackmagic Update event, the one and only Grant Petty brought us his usual no nonsense, no BS, straight to the point delivery to let us know that they're releasing some pretty cool new stuff. There's a new Blackmagic Studio Camera 4K plus G2. They also released a Blackmagic Micro Studio Camera 4K G2 once again, which is actually more interesting to me than the full-fat version. It's a teeny tiny box camera that's capable of 4K, 60. It's got 12G and HDMI output, micro 4 third sensor, and it costs just $995, which is actually really quite cheap. So I can see this being really useful for YouTubers or those with studios who want to get a camera up in unusual places. It's pretty cool, actually. What is this? A camera. For ants. And they also introduced a brand new Pocket Cinema Camera, which although they aren't calling a Pocket Cinema Camera, it most certainly is a Pocket Cinema Camera, and it most certainly isn't the box-style Cinema Camera people have been begging for for quite some time. This is the Cinema Camera 6K. It's the usual Pocket Camera body, but this time with a full-frame 6K sensor and the L mount, which, as you'd expect, naturally looks like it delivers absolutely lovely images, but people aren't happy, generally, because they wanted a box camera rather than this camera-style body. Now, all of that, generally, was pretty expected. The rumors about Blackmagic joining the L mount Alliance have been all over the internet for weeks now, so it wasn't that much of a surprise. What was a surprise was the release of the Blackmagic Camera app, an iPhone only, or at least the Apple ecosystem only, Camera app, which is kind of weird, right? I mean, it's kind of cool. It's free for starters, 100% free, and ready to download right now if you want it. Just jump over to the Apple Store, search for the Blackmagic Camera app, and you should be able to find it from there. Being free means it's accessible for everyone, which is very Blackmagic, and, as I say, pretty cool. The Blackmagic interface, as we all know, is a great one. If you've ever used any of the Blackmagic cameras or the video assist or anything like that, you know that the Blackmagic interface is very simple and easy to use, so that's not a bad thing having that on your iPhone to shoot some video or whatever. It comes with some advanced features, like time codes, histograms, focus assist, Zebras, grids, frame guides, false colors, and of course, 3D LUTs. There's also a funky stealth mode, which allows you to hold the phone in portrait mode, sort of upright, but it actually records landscape video. It manages this by cropping into the sensor, so you are losing resolution, losing quality, but still, it's a pretty neat solution. You can walk around with your phone like this while still recording landscape video rather than the dreaded portrait video, because if you're not a TikToker or whatever, you maybe don't care too much about portrait video. You can even sync footage up from multiple cameras using the built-in time codes for some multi-cam goodness, which again, I can see the uses. You can record directly to the iPhone storage, an external SSD, or have the footage uploaded directly to the brand new Blackmagic Cloud Storage, which is of course, Blackmagic's own take on cloud storage, specifically designed for DaVinci Resolve, which again, pretty cool. I've talked about that in slightly more detail in my 18.6 DaVinci Resolve update video, link below. Now the app records in ProRes and Apple Log, although of course, there's no Blackmagic RAW, which is a bit of a shame. Maybe that'll come in the future, who knows. Now to even create proxies and upload those directly to the cloud instead of the main footage to make sure that you don't immediately fill up your relatively expensive Blackmagic Cloud Storage. Now they mentioned that this camera to cloud workflow will also be coming to that URSA G2 broadcast camera later in the year, and eventually to that Cinema 6K camera as well. So this app is kind of a testing ground, I guess, before they implement the same thing on their higher end products. Now the reception, as you can imagine, has been pretty mixed, to say the least. Many people are thrilled to see a decent free camera app for use on their iPhone, they can mess around, learn some stuff, have some fun filmmaking, and they can cancel their Filmic Pro subscription, understandably, while others aren't so keen on this new direction that Blackmagic are taking, especially professionals that are wanting this Boxstyle camera and wanting them to really dive in to the professional side of things, spending most of the update talking about a free camera app for iPhone, not really their thing. But in my view, this app exists really for one very specific reason, which I think some people are overlooking, marketing. It's no secret that Blackmagic Design have a really unusual business model compared to most, especially now in 2023, when everything is a paid subscription, they give out DaVinci Resolve for free, and they build all of their paid products around that singular free piece of software. Everything is connected, you get DaVinci Resolve now for free in the hope that you may be by DaVinci Resolve Studio later, or an ATEM Mini or a panel or whatever. But I guess that issue, kind of an issue, people only know about Blackmagic if they've already started creating stuff, filming things, or at least have started to do some sort of editing. So how do they catch people? How do they make people aware of Blackmagic earlier than that? How do you introduce Blackmagic Design to an even bigger audience earlier in that pipeline? Maybe even introduce a whole new generation to the idea of filmmaking and everything involved. Simple, a free camera app for iPhone. One of the kids at school might hear about this, download it onto their iPhone, then they tell all their friends, everyone else is gonna download it too, and then they can start making cinematic videos, just like their favorite YouTubers. But hopefully in the process, they'll also learn about looks, or false colors, or color grading, or whatever. And oh, did you know they also do video editing software too? And that's free as well. You can see where this is going. But that's not to say that I don't think the app is useful. It's cool, and it's free, so you know, loads of people can benefit from it. I can see it being useful for those out in the field, or for people wanting a B-cam, or for some behind the scenes style footage. I personally would love to see a slightly different version. I'd like to see the camera app without the camera app. Honestly, I'd really like that camera to cloud workflow in an app. So if you imagine you're out on a shoot, you just plug your USB-C card reader into your phone and put in your SD card. Or if you've got an SSD, you shove that in. Everything is type C these days, so that makes a whole lot of sense. You select the files on your phone. You get your phone to generate the proxies. You sync those proxies with the cloud using your mobile data or Wi-Fi if you've got it. And then when you get home, your project is good to go. You've got all of those proxies ready to go. You can start editing, then you can plug your SSD or your SD card into your PC to get the camera originals. And job done! I actually think that would be more useful for the professional people, the people that are already doing this sort of thing. And again, marketing-wise, it'd be a good way of selling the cloud storage. So there you go. But above all else, this app, very much like the DaVinci Resolve iPad app itself, with its free version, should go a long way to introduce Blackmagic and DaVinci Resolve to a whole new audience. It's marketing, baby! What do you think? Let me know down in the comments whether you agree, disagree, whether you love the idea of the app, hate the idea of the app, want to see more from it, less from it, whatever it is, let me know. Thanks for watching. Take it easy.
