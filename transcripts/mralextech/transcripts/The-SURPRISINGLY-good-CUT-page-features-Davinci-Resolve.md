Just a short list of some of the small little things I do actually quite like about the cut page. Oh, and this video sponsored by Skillshare. Now let's open the cut page to take a look at the first one, which is the strip view, which isn't as rude as it sounds. So here we are on the cut page. And as you can see, this is our media pool. And this is probably what you're used to seeing these little thumbnails within your media pool. Now you can change how these look by these little icons at the top here. Now most of these are probably going to be familiar to you. You've got the thumbnail view, which we're currently on. You've got the metadata view, where you can just see some of the metadata for each of the files. And then you've got your list of view. All of these are already available to you on the edit page. But this one, the strip view, this is specific to the cut page. And if we give it a click, we get this nice little view. So these are all about individual clips, but as sort of film strips. Now the nice thing with this is, A, you can see the whole length of them. And B, you can see the audio track as well. You can see the waveforms. So if I go to this one here, I'm just going to single click it for now. You can see I've got my little red playhead and I can sort of skim through it at any point, even without the actual preview window open, I can hit I on my keyboard to mark an in, O on my keyboard to mark an out. And then I can click, drag and just pop this straight onto my timeline. And it's made that cut for us. If you do want to open up in the source viewer, you simply double click. And here's our clip. And you can see it's got our ins and outs already marked. Now I can just skim through the playhead here just by clicking and holding, or I can actually skim through the clip in the media pool to go through left and right, mark any ins and outs, drag, add to my timeline and job done. It's just a nice quick efficient way of building up your timeline. Next up, we've got quick access tools. You do now have access to the full inspector on the cut page, which you never used to have for some reason, but it is there now. But there's also access to some quick access tools which appear under your preview window. So I've got my preview window here. If I click this little icon, I can open up these tools. Now these are tools that you have access to anyway within the inspector, but I do like having them right underneath the preview window. If I need to do a transform, I don't need to open the inspector mesh around in there. I can just give this a click, do all my transforms. I can mess about with it in here, I can move the positions, rotation, I can do all of this sort of stuff, flip them and reset them if I've got it all wrong by clicking on a little reset. And done. We've got things like crop, we've got dynamic zooms, we've got composite, speed, all sorts of stuff within here. But there's also some additions within here, which you don't actually get within the inspector, again, for some strange reason. And the first one is this. This is our dynamic zoom. So I'm going to toggle this on. We've got our dynamic zoom controls in here. We've got the red and the green box that you probably used to, and we can adjust those as we need to. But the things that we're just specific to the cut page, these three over here. So by default, we have a zoom preset, which just means that it'll zoom like so. But we've also got a pan preset, which means we'll start over on the right hand side and pan over to the left, like so. And then we've also got an angle preset. Now this will start stuff in the top right and slowly pan us down to the bottom left. I'd love to see those within the inspector and additional drop down, which just allows us easy access to that on the edit page as well. Now another one of these quick tools, which you have access to is this one over here. And this is color and you get auto color. So as you can see, this is slightly washed out. It's probably some sort of log. It's actually some stock footage. I'm not too sure. But if I hit auto color, it's just going to add some contrast jazz it up a little bit. And then I can just toggle that on and off like so. Now you can do this already on the edit page, use the keyboard shortcut of Alt Shift and C. And it will do the same thing. But on the edit page, once you've done it, you can undo it. If I hit undo, it's going to undo the whole thing rather than actually undoing that auto color to get rid of the color. What you need to then do is hop into the color page. You can see I've got my node with my A on it, I would reset that and then have to hop back onto the edit page. And if you didn't know that auto color existed at all, well, there you go. You do know. And talking of learning new skills, here's a quick message from this video sponsor, Skillshare. Skillshare is an online learning community with thousands of inspiring classes for anyone who loves learning and wants to explore their creativity and learn new skills. Now I personally am always looking to learn and develop my own skills, especially around productivity and YouTube. And Skillshare is a great place to start. They've got everything from photography and video editing to maximizing productivity and learning how to create and grow your very own YouTube channel, like YouTube success, script, shoot and edit with MKBHD by Marcus Brownlee, which covers everything you need to know about creating your own YouTube channel. It covers everything from writing your script, planning your visuals, shooting your video, and even creating your thumbnails. So check the link down in the description below. The first 1000 people to give that a click will get a one month free trial of Skillshare. Winner. Next up, we've got timeline resolution templates. Now again, this is really handy to have. I'd love to see this on the edit page because it just makes life that little bit easier. You're all probably used to going into the cog and setting your timeline resolution as you need to or doing it individually on your timelines. But on the cut page, it's actually slightly easier. You come up here to the top right and there's this little drop down. And within there, we've got four presets, Ultra HD, Full HD, Portrait and Square. So anytime if I've realized that I'm doing this at Ultra HD, and I want it to actually be portrait for TikTok or Insta or whatever, I can just give that a click and it will immediately change my timeline to be a portrait timeline. And at any point, I can change it to square, you can change it back to Ultra HD. And it's just much easier than having to access the project settings every single time. On a very similar note, check this out. This project is Ultra HD, because it's going on to YouTube, but I'm probably going to upload it onto some different social medias as well. I don't have to export different copies for every different platform. I just want to have a rough idea of how it's going to look above your preview window. There's this little box here for safe area. If we click the drop down, there's a bunch of different options. So we've got social media, we've got a one by one, four by five, nine by 16, one by one is square and then nine by 16 is portrait. We've also got broadcast and film 1.33, 1.66, etc, as well as some other safe area guys like actions, title and center. So if I want to see how this is going to look, if it was uploaded to tix up, for example, I could tick my nine by 16. And it just show me this vertical crop. So we can just have a little look and say, actually, that's going to work okay, because my face is pretty much in the frame. It will work on YouTube, but it will work as a portrait video as well. If all of this is cropped off, and we can just toggle that on and off whenever we want it. So we can just see how it's going to look. Again, you can work with safe areas on the edit page, it's just quicker and easier to do on the cut page. Next up, we've got probably one of my favorite features of the cut page. And that's something called the source tape. So within my media pool, I've got this folder here called vlog, I'm going to open that up. And within that, we've just got a bunch of clips from a vlog that I recorded. Now these are all chronological, they're all in order throughout my day. And I just need to chop them up to create my actual vlog video. Now what I could do is just select them all, drop them on my timeline and then cut out the sections I don't want. But the source tape is a more efficient way. So above my preview window here, top left, I've got these little icons, the middle one is my source tape, I'm going to give that a click. And what that's going to do is put everything from my currently selected bin, so all of these clips into one big long virtual timeline. So I can view the entire thing in one big go. Now on this little timeline, you can see these little white marks, they indicate the start and end of the different clips. So you can see my playhead is on this far left clip here. And that clip is now being highlighted within my media pool. As I put my playhead over the white line to the next clip, you can see the second clip is now being highlighted within my media pool. And then we can just use this to start building up our timeline. So I'm going to go to the first clip, we'll use my iron O keys again. So I'm going to mark an in and an out. And I'll just click, drag and pop this onto my timeline, continue through the source tape, we'll grab the next section from this second clip. I'm going to click drag it over to the very far right hand side here. So just to append it on the end, and now you can see we've got two clips, and we just continue building up our timeline like so. You can even add in and out points over multiple clips. So if I add an in here, and then an out here, this is actually four different clips, we just click, drag right to the end to append, and it'll just put those onto the end of the timeline like so. Now something else just worth mentioning, the source tape order can also be changed. So you can see my last clip here is my little boy, Rolo. And at the beginning, it's just me in the kitchen. If I go to my actual bin, my media pool here, at the top, I've got sort order. I can change it to be any of these options. I'm going to leave mine as date modified, but change it from descending to ascending. And now the first clip within my source tape is the doggo. And my last clip is me in the kitchen. So the source tape just reflects the sort order of the bin itself. Simple. Now the next one is a really small thing, but with the introduction of the new proxies within DaVinci Resolve, the way that proxies work, I like this method. And I think this should be introduced on the edit page as well. So with the new proxy generator for DaVinci Resolve 18, if you want to switch between proxies, you now simply go playback proxy handling, and then you've got the option between proxies and camera originals. But on the cut page is actually slightly easier. Up here, top right hand corner, you've got a little dropdown for proxy handling. You give that a click and you can change between prefer proxies and prefer camera originals. Now let's be honest, going to playback proxy handling and changing them within there isn't exactly hard work. But the thing I like about using this is its color coordinated. So you can see purple, it's got a little purple film strip. That means that I'm on proxies. If I'm on camera originals, it's just white. Small thing I know, but I like being able to see what I'm doing without actually having to go into an additional menu. Next up on the cut page, there's something called close up, which allows you to do these sort of snap zooms really quickly and easily. Now quick caveat to this, they don't actually work exactly as I would like them to, but I'm going to show you where they are in case they work well for you and also let you know how I would prefer them to work if it was possible. So the first thing I'm going to do, I'm going to put my playhead to the point where I'm my little zoom in to start. So let's just go with somewhere like that. Then underneath my media pool, I've got these little icons. The fourth one along, this is a close up. And if I give it a click, this is going to drop a close up on our timeline above like so. And now if I hit play, it's just going to cut in the issue I have with it. If I give it a click, open the inspector, it kind of guesses where it wants the zoom to be. So you can zoom my zoom is 1.3 and the position is seven and then minus 345. But it's put my face right in the center, which means my eye line doesn't really level up. So I would personally want this sort of a bit more zoomed out and a little bit higher. So when it cuts, my eye line stays roughly the same. Now, if I was to go to a different section on my timeline, close up, give it a click, this time it's at 1.2 with a 38 minus 32. So it sort of guesses and makes it different every time. I'm not too sure of the reason why. I'd love to be able to set the default for the close up. So whenever I hit close up, it's the same zoom and the same position every single time. If they were to make those a little bit more logical, I'd really, really like that method. Now last one I'm going to show you is the quick export. Now, this does exist elsewhere, but again, I just like the way it functions on the cut page. So top right hand corner of the cut page, you've just simply got a quick export button. You give it a click, there's a bunch of defaults within here. So I can simply go to YouTube, it's defaulted to 3840, because that's my timeline resolution. I can hit export, choose the location, give it a name, hit save, and it'll just export this video without me having to go onto the deliver page at all. You can, or at least you should be able to add your own presets to here, but the option seems to be missing individual 18. I think that's a bug, but hopefully that will be fixed very soon. Now, you can actually do this on the edit page, you simply go to file, there's a quick export option within there, which you can assign a keyboard shortcut to if you so wish, which does exactly the same thing. But having a little button in the top right hand corner, it could go alongside mixer and inspector in here. I think would be a nice little thing, you just give it a click, have your options, hit export, and job done. Now I wanted to do a quick honorable mention to something called the sync bin. It's meant as a kind of a replacement for multicams. I know if I don't mention it, people will let me know down in the comments. The sync bin for me just doesn't work as well as multicams. I just don't find it as efficient. I don't like the way it works. I like having control of the multicams. So I use multicams. But I wanted to let you know, sync bins exist. If you want to know more about sync bins, just pop sync bin into YouTube. There's a few videos on that in the past. But anyway, that's it for this one. Thanks for watching. Take it easy. I'll see you next time.
