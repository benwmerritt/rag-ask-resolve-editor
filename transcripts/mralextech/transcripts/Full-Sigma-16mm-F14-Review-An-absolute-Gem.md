Third-party lenses. I love them. They often offer a viable alternative to the first-party lenses and usually at a fraction of the cost. Today we're going to have a look at one of the most popular third-party options and that is the Sigma 16mm DCDN contemporary lens for the APS-C E-Mount cameras. So is it a viable alternative to the first-party lenses or a third-party lens you should avoid at all costs. Let's head home and we'll find out. Right, first things first real quick unboxing. I'm going to put that knife. Alright, we got it out. Now before we get into it, if you enjoy this video please consider giving me a thumbs up and subscribing to my channel. I'm going to continue to do more of these style videos. If you thought it was a bit shit please comment below and let me know why so I can improve for next time. Cheers! So here it is. The lens is made of a mixture of metal and plastic with a little bit of rubber thrown in as well. So the base of the lens here on the barrel feels quite plasticky. The rest of the lens feels like a metal construction. The manual focus ring has a rubber texture to it which is really really nice and grippy and you're not going to slip on it if it's a little bit wet. It's a little light for my liking. It moves a little bit too freely but it's very smooth and it feels very nice to use. The lens mount is metal as expected and there is a rubber gasket to help with the weather sealing. The lens hood is plastic but it's quite well made. Feels quite strong. Doesn't flex much at all. Have no reservations about that. It has a large glass front element which has a filter size of 67mm. The filter thread itself is made of plastic not metal. Now on that note the front end mount doesn't protrude past the lens but it's very very close to the front of the lens and the downside to that is it does get dirty quicker than those that have the glass recessed a little bit. So something just to bear in mind. The lens weighs 430 grams so nearly half a kilo which is relatively hefty if you're not used to using relatively chunky primal lenses. It actually weighs about the same as the a6500 itself so with this lens attached you're essentially doubling the weight of the camera. Now a thing to bear in mind with this weight is it actually feels to me anyway like it's closer to the front of the lens. It makes it feel a little bit front heavy. It's still not a particularly heavy combination but it's front heavy. Now really weirdly there's almost a pro to that and it's when you're holding it like this if you're doing any vlogging it means the weight of the camera is actually sitting in the palm of your hand so it doesn't feel like it's trying to fall out of your hand that way. It will feel quite long if you've come from the kit lens however it's not actually that big it's about the same size as most 85 millimeters. Again if you're looking for some context with the lens hood attached it's roughly the same length as your a6500 is in width so if you turn your a6500 on its side the height of it that's roughly how big this lens the lens is completely black with a little bit of detailing. You've got some white text on the barrel of the lens so which is 16 millimeter and then the sigma logo also on the side and then a white dot to line it up with the camera when you're attaching. The front of the lens also has some text on it but that's actually black on black and I really like that it's really subtle so you can barely see it but it does say 16 millimeter f1.4 dc dn made in Japan. Now it's worth mentioning at this point really quickly that this lens doesn't have inbuilt image stabilization. Now if like me you use an a6500 that's not too much of an issue because you've got the in-body image stabilization but if you're using an older camera like the a6300 or the a6000 then it is definitely something you need to think about. Overall it's quite attractive, it's subtle, it matches the camera really well with its styling, the size and weight in my opinion are good at best and acceptable at worst. It's not the most balanced lens in the world as I say it feels a little bit front heavy but overall it's well constructed, it feels substantial and it's not overly heavy or overly big. I like it. Right real quick interlude, I actually filmed this review over the space of about a week during which I got a stinking horrible cold. Now I've done my best to edit out any sniffles and just not sound entirely gross and disgusting but if I do sound a bit rank that's why. Keeping my ass but with soldiering up. Right now the next thing we're going to talk about is the image quality and I'm happy to tell you guys that the image quality is very very good. Let's start off with the colors, the colors come out of this lens looking really really nice. I actually really like the look of the images from this rather, they have a lot of color and lots of depth to them. Sharpness is excellent all throughout the range, one of the biggest selling points of this lens is its super fast maximum aperture of f1.4 and it performs well even wide open at f1.4. The center of the image is sharp and the bokeh falls away really really nicely. Talking about bokeh, the bokeh is very very good, it's really smooth and it falls away really nicely. Now it's a good job actually because there's a lot of bokeh to contend with with this lens. Being a f1.4 lens and having a minimum focus distance of only 25 centimeters you can get really close to your subject which results in lots and lots of out of focus blur. Fortunately as I said it's really really nice. This lens will flare however if you shoot towards the sun, it's not the end of the world, it's not horrendous but it's definitely something to bear in mind. Vignetting you'll see a little bit wide open at f1.4 but not much at all so actually vignetting is handled really really well. Overall I was blown away with the image quality of this lens, it's a very very nice lens. Now all of those pros also roll into video. The video from this lens again looks really really nice straight out, the camera, the colors are nice, the bokeh is nice, everything worked really really well but don't just take my word for it let's have a look at some examples. So here we are in Lightroom just with a couple of really quick examples. This was shot at f1.7 and you can see that the center of the frame is really really sharp indeed everything sharp on the glasses, on the skin, the hair, it's all pinned sharp. There's a little bit of vignetting at this 1.6 but again not much at all, the colors are really nice, the sky is very blue and you can see a little bit green. It wouldn't take much sort of boost to get those looking really nice I'll be quite happy with that as it is. This is how it looks raw straight out of the camera with a couple of tweaks just to warm it up and get a really nice image. Now just to show you the amount of distortion that you get this doesn't have any profile correction on at the moment if I enable the profile correction it just levels it out a little bit. This one was shot at f1.4 and as you can see there's plenty of sharpness. Boker the outer focus background blows away really nicely up here it does look like there's a little bit of chromatic aberration felt for even going on around here but it's not too noticeable there's not much at all really it'd be easy to get rid of in post. This shot here again this is raw straight out of the camera this was at the minimum focus distance and again at 1.4 so we can zoom right in you can see how thin the depth of field is this part of the feather is here in focus for everything before and after is outer focus. This shot here was taken directly into the sun just to see some of the flare and as you can see there's a fair bit of flare going on there's a little dove here there's more throughout the image there's more there and there's a big chunk down here you can see the little rainbow and the green so if you're shooting into the sun you will get flare so you need to be careful of that because it flares. This here is a shot from my wedding I did again you can see the colors are really nice this is raw straight out of the camera no adjustments at all here as you can see at 2.2 this image is perfectly sharp as well this image I've taken I've actually made it really dark just so you can see the vocables now as you can see they're not perfectly spherical they're more lemony a little bit lemon shape but they're not too bad at all this was shot at f 1.4 now if we zoom into the center it's pretty sharp there's a little bit of softness going on wide over that 1.4 but it's still perfectly usable and as we moved down this was at f2 so one stop down you can see the sharpness has improved quite dramatically actually set that down again to f 2.8 this is at f4 and again it's a little bit sharper it's probably the sharpest around here around f.4 but there's not a huge difference between f4 and f2.8 it's usable at f 1.4 but if you want the sharpest f 2.8 f4 is probably where you want to be this is at f 5.6 f8 and lastly f 13 and again it's really sharp here and as you can see the actual amount of things in focus the depth of field has increased dramatically this is at 13 and this is at 1.4 now obviously image quality doesn't mean anything if the lens can't focus and again i'm happy to report that this lens focuses really really well it's quick and it's snappy even in low light it will start to hunt a little bit when it gets really dark it moves through the range really really quickly so even when it hunts it's not the end of the world it's not as slow as some lenses it's quick especially on the a6500 it's almost as quick but maybe a tiny bit slower on the a7r2 but it's still very very good even on that full-frame camera it's also very very quiet in fact it's nearly silent apart from the odd little click here and there i've recorded with x7 microphones but you don't even have to you could get away with using the internal microphone on these things because you won't hear the lens focusing which is a real bonus here's a quick demonstration to show you how well it handles low light focusing i'm in my hallway i've closed some doors making nice dark i'm having to shoot at 30 200 iso at 1.4 to get a shutter speed of 1 30th of a second so it's pretty dark in here we'll see how the autofocus performs and here's another quick demonstration to show you how well the eye and the face detection works both within videos and photos it's continuous autofocus the area is set to wide and i'm shooting at f 2.8 so let's see how well it does at tracking my face same test again but this time we're shooting on the a7r2 16mm it's in super 35mm all the same settings 2.8 so let's see how this one does hey eye autofocus test on the 6500 with the 16mm at f 1.4 what you'll notice here is that the face detection and the eye autofocus actually work very well as long as you're close enough to your subject as soon as they go a certain distance away and become too small in the frame then it stops working quite so reliably overall again i'm really really impressed with the focusing on this lens the minimum focus distance is nice and close you can get really close up to your subject it's super fast in good light and decently quick in low light it's near silent for video recording even with continuous autofocus again i don't really have a bad word to say about this lens when it comes to the focusing abilities so let's talk about the focal length 16 millimeters is considered very wide now on the aps-c cameras when you take in the crop factor it actually gives you an equivalent field of view of 24 millimeters 24 millimeters is an extremely popular focal length through full frame users it's generally a considered a wide angle lens but it's not so wide that you get tons of distortion it's a very popular choice for walk around focal length medium sort of wide ish landscape wedding photographers quite often have one in the bag if they need to get wider group shots that sort of thing any sort of situation where you need a relatively wide angle 24 millimeters is generally considered a go-to focal length but there's a caveat to all that and that's that this lens isn't a 24 millimeter it's a 16 millimeter it just gives you an equivalent view of 24 millimeters now what that means is you get the same viewpoint as you would on a 24 millimeter but you get the amount of distortion as you would on a 16 millimeter so this lens distorts much more than a full frame 24 millimeter this lens is a really popular choice among youtubers it's really popular for some b-roll and it's just about wide enough for some vlogging I'm holding the a6500 with the 16mm at arm's length and it's a little bit tight but overall it works pretty well but you can see this lens has a really nice aesthetic for this sort of thing I'm separated nicely here comes the dog I'm separated nicely from the background due to the the large aperture and it has that quotation full frame look it looks really nice I'm really separated from the background it looks really pleasing now the in body image stabilization is currently turned on this is with the steady shot the in body image stabilization turned off now if you're stationary or you want to do a little bit of panning it's not too bad at all the obvious really makes a difference when you start walking you start bouncing around there's quite a significant difference when you've got the the stabilization turned on to turned off if you're using an a6500 obviously leave it turned on if you've got an a6000 or an a6300 this lens is still a good choice you just maybe have to slow things down be a little bit more stationary if you're trying to use it for vlogging but what about b-roll well we're going to throw some b-roll up for you now so here it is now talking to focal length you may notice that this looks really really wide and there's quite a heavy vignette all around me now I'm actually filming on the 16 millimeter but this time around it's attached to my a7r2 you full frame users you have the ability within the camera to select either a full frame readout for shooting 4k or super 35 millimeter super 35 millimeter essentially crops the lens to be the same as that on the aps-c however you can use the full frame which is what i'm doing now so the 16 millimeter is a full 16 millimeters and then there's the clear zoom which actually allows you to zoom in further than the crop you can zoom into times two so this lens has equivalent field of view of 32 millimeters using full frame readout on my a7r2 this lens actually gives me a field of view of anywhere from 16 millimeters all the way up to 32 millimeters and that can become really really useful so this is the same field of view you'd see when this lens was attached to an aps-c camera now bear with me this is with it dialed all the way out to 16 millimeters the field of view is significantly wider now the vignetting it's not ideal it doesn't look the best but for certain things it would work you could actually use this vignetting as an aesthetic choice however there's also a really nice middle ground there with me again and this is with it at 1.2 this is a nice middle ground there's maybe a bit of a vignette but it's not much at all but the lens is actually significantly wider than at the 1.5 so at the aps-c field of view the 24 millimeter field of view this is probably equivalent to about an 18-19 millimeters and it's perfectly usable there's a bit of a vignette but it's not too noticeable so when you use this lens on a full frame camera you get much more scope for vlogging. value for money this lens goes for about 400 quid in the uk however you can pick it up for a little bit less between three and 350 quid if you're willing to get a gray impulse in the us on amazon.com it's currently going for $449 so is that good value for money in my opinion yes it is it is an expensive lens as far as aps-c lenses go it's one of the more expensive options however there's not really an alternative to it if you need a fast wide lens the 16 millimeter is one of the only options in there it's definitely the only one that goes all the way down to f1.4 unless you want to buy a full frame and fe lens compared to its full frame counterpart it's actually quite well priced so in terms of bang for buck it's actually not that bad so should you buy it in my opinion yes if you're an aps-c user then there aren't really many alternatives out there yes it's expensive but it's actually quite good value for money the lens doesn't really have any real noticeable weak point it's fast it's reasonably well built it's not overly big or overly heavy it's sharp it focuses well for photography and it works really well for video as well it's a lens which can do a lot of things so actually it's a very very good option if you're a full frame user it's a little bit more difficult because there are more alternatives out there if you're not that interested in a lens for photography it's more for video then yes i could definitely recommend that you check this lens out you can save yourself a whole lot of money by picking up a sigma 16 millimeter rather than the equivalent full frame lens however obviously as soon as you attach this to a full frame camera for photography you will lose half of your megapixels if that doesn't bother you too much then definitely have a look at this lens it works just as well for video on the full frame cameras as it does on the crop sensor cameras and this sums up the review it's an excellent lens it's reasonably well priced it's well made it's weather sealed it's a very good lens for videography and it has a multitude of uses overall i really like this lens i'm going to hold on to this lens i can highly recommend it and i think you should definitely go and have a look if you're interested in a fast wide-angle lens and that's it for this one i hope you enjoyed it if you've got any queries or questions feel free to pop them below and i will be sure to answer them cheers
