## Transcript
DaVinci Resolve 19 is here! Yeah! Yes! Now it's currently in public beta, which we'll talk about in a second, but as you can imagine it's full of some really cool new features. One of them is this Film Look creator, which I've just had a play with and it's awesome, it's going to be insanely popular. It allows you to create really nice cinematic looking grades super quickly, you can even do it directly from the edit page. Yeah, there's been a big improvement to the transcriptions feature, so now you can even have different speakers and they've added a bunch of mind-blowingly good AI audio features, one of which is something we've been talking about for ages. That one especially, like the dialogue separator is... Pfft! But this music remixer... Oh! Now, as you can imagine, all of those features are limited to the paid studio versions, however, there's good news for free users as well, because the performance difference between free and studio should be significantly reduced in DaVinci Resolve 19. I'll tell you why in a few minutes. But first, I need to do a quick bit of housekeeping. This is a public beta, it's available to download right now, but it won't pop up within your DaVinci Resolve. Instead, you'll need to head over to the DaVinci Resolve support website and download it for yourself. As a public beta, it will be buggy, it will crash, you will have hiccups, all that sort of stuff, so just prepare for that. Don't upgrade if you're in any major projects, that's also a good thing to keep in mind. And before you do anything, make sure you do a quick backup of all of your project libraries just to be safe. And I think that just about covers it. Now, this isn't an extensive video covering all of these features because I've not been able to look at it for particularly long and I don't know all of the ins and outs, but I'm excited to talk about it so I want to share it with you all. So that's what we're going to do right now. And we're going to start off with an audio feature, which is awesome and it's going to save me tons and tons of time. And that is the new ducking feature. There was technically a way to do the ducking within Fairlight, but still you'd have to jump into Fairlight mess around to get it to work. Whereas now you can do this directly on the timeline on the edit page. So I've got this example set up. I talk for a bit, but then there's some big gaps underneath there. We have music, which we want to duck. Now you do do this at a track level. So you need to set up an entire track just for your music. I've got audio to down here. So then if we give that a click, then open up the inspector. We can see the track level audio controls. We have a new one called ducker. We just enable that. The source is the talking. So that's the thing we're listening to to know when to duck. And then we can change the duck level. There are also some advanced controls within here at the very beginning when it's quiet, the music will be loud and then it will duck down. So good morning. Hopefully it's the morning. And then the opposite here. All of that was shot on this. This is the sure, super useful. Ha, that's going to save me loads of time in pretty much every single project that I ever do. Wow. Good one. Nice. I'm excited for that. Next, let's talk about the transcriptions. So it was this time last year where they added the transcription feature into the VINCHA Resolve 18.5. And while it's worked really well, it did lack a couple of features, one of them being speaker recognition. So now when you right click on a clip and come down to the audio transcriptions, there's now an option to enable the speaker recognition. If you then run the transcriptions, you've got a new column with speaker one, speaker two, however many speakers there are, you can rename them and then you can edit this transcription knowing who is saying what. That just makes life a whole lot easier. It's pretty cool. In my testing with this clip of me and Casey from our podcast, which I've linked down below if you want to check it out, it does seem to work pretty well. It's a nice new feature. It's something that people were asking for. And now it's here. Another feature they've added is the ability to import existing transcriptions via a subtitles SRT file. So if you have got a transcription already from a third party app or whatever, you can import it directly rather than having to run the transcriptions within resolve itself. Once they're in, they work in exactly the same way. You can just copy bits from the transcription window, drop them straight onto the timeline and job done. And lastly, they've added the ability to edit timeline content from within this transcription window as well, which I think is a really neat feature. So I've got my transcription window up here for an individual clip and I've added a bunch to my timeline, as you can see just down here. Now within the transcription window, we've got this little icon to jump over to the timeline view. And now we can see that transcription from the timeline. Now there's a few cool things with this. For starters, I say something rubbish here on Casey does. Let's highlight that. And you can see we'll select on the timeline and then I can hit delete to get rid of that section. Now what's also cool, you can see these little icons here, these represent gaps. Now you can see there's a big gap here on the timeline where I'm not really saying much of anything. It's quite a few actually, big gaps and they're all represented within this transcription. So on the timeline itself, we can simply click this icon and it's just going to remove all of those gaps. Let's scroll back over. It's cut all of the gaps out so we have a nice, tidy, streamlined timeline. Pretty cool indeed. Next up, sticking with the edit page, they've just made speed warps faster. Or should I say you've got the option to use a faster speed warp or a better speed warp. Now, if you've never heard of speed warp, it's a really cool studio only feature which allows you to do slow motion for clips that weren't shot at a high frame rate. So it kind of artificially fills in the gaps using AI and can we just take a moment to appreciate just how good it is. This flag is slowed down to like 10% and it looks incredible. Anyway, now when you activate the speed warp feature from within the inspector, you have speed warp faster and speed warp better. One of the issues with speed warp previously was that it is a resource hard. It's really difficult to run. There is now speed warp faster, which is considerably faster to run, but obviously doesn't give you quite as good results. Right, now I've got a quick fire round here of quick edit page things that they have added. So let's run through these really, really quick. Text plus in viewer. So now from within the preview, the viewer display on the edit page, as long as you've got the fusion overlay open and you can move the text around, you can highlight text and you can type directly in the viewer itself rather than having to jump into the inspector. So that just makes working with text plus that little bit easier. You now have access to the trim editor within the edit page. So the trim editor or the enhanced trim editor, whatever it was called on the cut page was really handy. You can now do that on the edit page. So all you do on an edit point, obviously you'd click and drag like so. But now if you double click, you get this enhanced viewer and it's actually really handy. So here's the, you've got the left and the right. So here's the first clip and here's the second clip and then you can move that edit point along or you can trim them, you can roll them. And it just gives you a much bigger view rather than trying to do all that stuff directly on the timeline. You can now search across all effect library folders. This one's super handy. So I don't know whether it was just me, you'd search within the effects library for a title or whatever and then you'd go and open up the effects and wonder why there's no results and it's because you've still got something to search. What? Now if you click on the little dropdown next to the magnifying glass rather than searching within the current folder, you can search across the entire effects library, which just makes life easier. And then you're making life easier. They've added a super sneaky little keyboard shortcut. So now within the effects library, let's go to titles. Obviously if you click on the little icon that expands titles like so. However, if you hold alt or option and then click what it would do, it will open titles but it'll also open all of the folders within titles. So then you don't need to go down and individually open everything. You can open it all in one big go. If I hold alt and then close titles and then just open it regularly, you can see all of those things are closed. Now that also applies to the favorites folder. So obviously you get favorites within the effects library. Now all of the standard folders are available within favorites, which just helps to keep your favorites area nice and organized. Winner. If for whatever reason you prefer the fixed playhead style of the cut page, you can now have that on the edit page instead. All you do, you click on this little icon to open up the timeline view options and then there's an option to enable the fixed playhead and now you move the timeline around rather than moving the playhead around. Quick random mention. This isn't talked about anywhere, but this timeline menu looks different. They've taken the design cues from the cut page and that's the first time I've seen them implemented on the edit page. When I say cut page design, I mean touch friendly design, iPad-y kind of design. Maybe. Anyway, next up, you can now restore from deleted timelines. So there is a super handy timeline backup feature within the current version of DaVinci Resolve. So you can just restore backups if you've made any errors or whatever. Now what you can do, if you've deleted that timeline entirely, you can click on the three little dots within the media port and you can go to deleted timeline backups and you can see all of the timelines that you've deleted along with the backups that were created along the way. You can get it back in a jiffy. Nice. Support for bezier controls with open effects keyframes. This is another big one. So previously you could use the open effects effects, things like transforms and there's loads of cool stuff within there and you could add keyframes, but you couldn't add any curves to those keyframes. Now you can open the keyframe editor and you can add ease ins and ease outs and S curves and all that sort of stuff, which makes all of the open effects, plugins, effects, whatever you want to call them, much, much better to use. Some of those actually have built in motion blur as well. Like the transform one is going to be way better to use. I'm thinking we could probably make some really super easy, handy, fast transitions now. That's a job for another day. You now have the ability to select the audio channels when doing an audio sync. So I have to sync up my video and audio whenever I do these sorts of videos. It's dead quick and easy in resolve. You just select both the video and the audio and it will all sync up on the waveform. Super handy. The downside is it never really worked if you had multiple different audio channels and you could never pick which one you were using for the sync. Now there is the option. So if I was to go to try and sync these two, I could highlight them both, right click, auto sync audio. This new window will pop up. I can select waveform and then I can select the channel number. So I do want it to be the channel one, two, three, however many channels I've got. I've only got one, so there's only one option, but you get the idea. There's also mix and automatic. Mix will take all of the channels and squish them together into one and then try and figure out from there. Super useful if one of your channels has got a big sort of empty space in the middle, for example, and then you've got automatic as well, where again the DaVinci Resolve brain, I don't know, the little man, the little wizard in DaVinci Resolve will figure out the best channel to use to get the best sync and then it will go from there. And last but not least for this not so quick, quick fire round, we have improved voice isolation and dialogue leveler. So these two features have been within DaVinci Resolve Studio for a little while now. They've made them faster. So you've got things like faster queue up and improve performance and a more responsive buffer. If you've ever used them, they do work well. They do just feel a little bit snappier now. There's not that delay when you turn them on. It all just kind of works, which brings me really nicely into one of the big new features they have added. And it's something we've wanted for a while or at least lots of you guys in the comments have mentioned it's now here and it's awesome. But before we get into that, here's a quick message from this video sponsor, Audio. Audio is a music subscription service that contains all of the music and sound effects you could ever need. And it's music from real artists that doesn't feel or sound like generic stock music. There's pop, there's rock, there's hip hop, there's country and there's even some cinematic bangers. And now they even have stems. So you can pick to download the full mix or just the individual elements that you need. Giving you even more options to find just the right music for any project. And the Audio Pro License does cover you for literally any project. Film, TV, social media, YouTube, of course, video games, podcasts and even audio books. And the Audio Pro License is available for your first year for just $59. That's a massive 70% off. Just click the links down in the description below. Hey, and we are back. Next up we're going to talk about a new one called the Dialogue Separator. Now this kind of works like the voice isolation tools. You can actually do the same thing as the voice isolation tools. However, it also allows you to do the reverse just like everyone asked for. So basically if you've recorded some b-roll and someone's chatting away in the background, you can just get rid of them. And it's really clever. Now I didn't have a great example to use so I actually baked in some background noise into this clip of me talking and it sounds like this. Well, you're not alone. Now this one, just like the ducker, is track based. So I need to click on my Audio One track where all of the audio is. And as you can see, we have Dialogue Separator. We toggle that on. We've got three sliders for voice, background and ambience. And then we've got three tick boxes to mute voice, mute background or mute ambience. So all you do, if I wanted to mute the background, I tick mute background and then we hit play. Well, you're not alone. I did too. And now we have no background noise and it works really well. It's really clever. Obviously, that's not that much different from the voice isolation tools. So we just simply untick this mute background and instead mute the voice and then hit play. And you can't hear me at all. You can just hear the background noise. Now with these sliders, you can also increase the different elements. So if I wanted to increase the background, maybe keep the voice but bring it right down. We can do. So you can use this however you like. How clever is that? Now I must admit, I've only played with it briefly. I can't at the moment really figure out the difference between background and ambience. There's probably quite a subtle difference and I'm using quite obvious examples. So I haven't quite figured that out. If I do figure it out, I'll also put that down in the comments below. Talking of things that I don't know how it works and blows my mind. Next up, another one of the AI features, again, limited to the studio only version, is what they're calling the music remix at all. And I don't get it. So people like audio, like if you go to a good music subscription service like audio, you can download the individual stem. So you can go for the instrumentals or just the drums or whatever. But I know that isn't always available to you. This tool allows you to do that directly from, what, directly from the edit page? So again, this is track level. So I've set this up on audio one. We enable the music remixer and we've got voice, drums, bass, other and guitar. Very similar. We've got levels and then we've got mutes. So if we just hit play on this one, obviously there's vocals where if we just mute the voice. Now there's no vocals. How? How does it do this? I don't understand. There's quite an obvious drum beat. Let's mute the drums and we can combine them. Let's mute those, but let's give it loads of bass. That one especially like the dialogue separator is, but this music remixer. Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself and I'm getting really excited by those new features because I don't understand them. They're really clever. Next, get on track. I'll keep it on track. Talking of track, what a segue that was. They're now added an AI based Intelli track. So basically it uses AI to do tracking a little bit quicker. And again, in my experience, it's super quick and seems to work really quite well. So from the color page, we've got this little drifty car coming along. If you wanted to do any sort of tracking, if we just open up the tracker, we jump over to FX and then we change the point tracker down here to this new Intelli track. And then I can grab the little thing on the screen, the little pointer and we just put it on there and then we just hit track. And yeah, look how quick that is. There you go. Tracking done real time. I didn't even speed that up. That's exactly how fast it is on my system. I don't know if it's more accurate than any of the previous methods, but it's certainly quicker. So as long as it's as accurate as the previous one, your workflow's just got quicker. And another really cool thing you can do with that, which I don't know who's going to work particularly well on this YouTube video because I'm recording internally and all that sort of thing, but you can now do the Intelli track with audio panning on the Fairlight page. Essentially, if you've got something going from left to right on your shot and you want the audio to also pan, you can use this tracking to do the panning for you. I'm a seagull, baby. So we're in Fairlight. We've got this same clip we used before underneath the little preview. We click on this icon and then we show the track of controls. We put our little tracker on the car. We select left and right because we're going to do a little pan. And then we need to select the track that we're using and then we select sort of in's and out. So we select the actual area we're doing this for and then we track. And then if we play all of that audio is coming out of the left hand side. And then as it goes along, it pans the audio to where this tracker is, just like the ducker. That was possible before, but you had to do it all manually. Now you can do it all automatically with pretty much a click of a button. Winner. So we're going to stick with the color page because there's a few things to show you in here. There's actually loads of stuff. I'm going to skip some of it. There's a new color slicer, which I haven't had enough time to get to play with. I don't understand it well enough to talk about it, but that's there. Someone else I'm sure will do a really good video on that. I'm going to skip that though for now. I'm going to talk about, first of all, the new de-focus background effect. If you've ever used like a portrait mode on your phone, de-focus in the background. That's what this does. That's made this de-focus background effect to get that effect really quickly and easily directly on the color page. In my testing, which you're seeing now, it does work quite well and it's really simple to use. Combine it with something like the Magic Mask and then you can get a nice de-focus background in no time at all. They've also improved the face refinement tool. So if you've ever used the face refinement tool, it allows you to track faces and then you can do individual grading. You can pick up the lighting, add makeup, beautify, all that sort of stuff. I've just made that slightly more refined, funnily enough. So if I grab the face refinement, I'll drop it on this clip of me and Casey and then all of these new controls at the top. The main thing, I think the most important thing, if I detect the faces in the frame, we now get these boxes and I can just say, is it Casey's or is it me? It's going to be me and then I'll track it. Then it's just going to track me throughout the clip, all of my features and then we can go and make any changes that are required. Now they've also added what they call Ultra NR or Ultra Noise Reduction. This again uses AI. So it's an AI version of the existing noise reduction tools within the color page. And the idea behind these is they're not quite as good as the previous stuff, but they're much faster. So it's kind of like your Speedwarp. You can either go for the absolute best, but know that there's going to be a performance hit or you can use this new AI assisted variant. Enabling it is super easy. On the color page, we just come to our normal noise reduction area. It exists within the spatial noise reduction. We change the mode from faster, better enhanced to Ultra NR. With that selected, we simply click analyze and it will find a point within the clip that's kind of neutral and it can see the noise. And then it will set the Luma and the Chroma automatically. So then you're done. That's it. You just change it, you hit the analyze and you're good to go. You've got your noise reduction applied. Now if you want to, you can move this box around. You can resize it and move it to a different area. And you still have control over the Luma, the Chroma and the blend if you want to tweak it to make sure that it's exactly as you want it to be. I don't know how it stacks up. I haven't had time to really compare the two, but it's cool that it's there and it's cool that it's automatic, faster and just generally easier to use. So many updates. This video is going to be a long one, isn't it? Yeah. Let's talk about the cut page for a second and then we're going to come back to probably my favorite, that film look creator. So on the cut page, they've added a few new things. There's improved grouping on the cut page effects. So within the effects library, previously everything was just dumped in there and the names weren't right. It would always show the file path for a custom effect. It was all a bit strange. Now that's all been fixed. You also now have access to the resolve effects and fusion effect overlays on the cut page. So to activate this, you click on the little graphy thing, this one here, under the preview window and then you get these quick access settings. The one on the far right is your effects overlay and then you can switch between open effects overlay and fusion overlay. Now those two last things are really important for people like me that create custom effects. Things like my magic zoom, for example, never really worked on the cut page because A, it was difficult to find from within the effects library and B, you didn't have the fusion overlay available. They fixed both of those things, which means my magic animate and my magic zoom should work much better now on the cut page, which also means they should now work much better on the iPad as well. Not had chance to test it myself, but initially that's good news. Right. If I don't use this enough, I need to talk about this film look creator. I'll probably even make a full video about this when I finished recording this one because it's cool. I really like it. So in a nutshell, what does it do? Well it allows you to create a filmic look within DaVinci Resolve just quicker and it's easier. So you don't need to use loads of different nodes. It has a filmic style look, a little bit of a color grade built in and then you can adjust the color, the exposure, the tint, all that sort of stuff directly within this one effect. You can enable effects like halation, grain, and there's even a built in color space transform. So again, you could do it all in one place and you can do all of that directly on the edit page using an adjustment clip, which all goes to make your life a whole lot easier. I think that's it in a nutshell. I'll do a proper demo. Get your eyes peeled for that. Oh my God, this is such a long video. I hope you're enjoying this because this is a really long one. Right, to finish up, we have some general codec performance information that's worth mentioning. Up to three times faster, H.264 and 265D code on non-studio in Windows. So pretty much if you're shooting any sort of regular camera and you're not shooting anything fancy like raw video or whatever, it's probably going to be in H.264 or H.265. Now, that decodes two or three times faster. Now, by decoding, it means it's unpacking the video files. So when you're actually using them on the timeline, which means your general timeline performance should be much, much faster and it should be more in line with what you get from studio, which just means that's better for everyone. I think that's a really great decision because some people were like, I've tried to venture resolve it a bit slow, so I don't want to upgrade to studio. If they did upgrade to studio, it would then be a bit quicker. Now they get to know how quick it is on the free version of Windows. Sweet. Anyway, this is Derinch Resolve 19. Here's a bunch of stuff I'm excited about. I hope you are too. Thanks for watching. Take it easy. Talk to me in the comments. I'll see you at NAB.
