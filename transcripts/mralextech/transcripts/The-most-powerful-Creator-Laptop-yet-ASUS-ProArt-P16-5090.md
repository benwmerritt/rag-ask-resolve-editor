This is the brand new Asus ProArt P16 for 2025, and it might just be one of the most powerful creator-focused laptops you can buy, with one of the best laptop displays I think I've ever seen. It's a 1600 nits 16 inch 16 by 10 4K 120 hertz tandem OLED display, and it is lovely. It covers 100% of the DCI P3 range, it's HDR True Black 1000 certified, Pantone validated, and has a Delta E reading of less than one. So you get a professional grade panel you can trust while you're out on a bow. Winner. Now it is a glossy panel, so you will get some reflections, but it does feature an anti-reflective coating, which does seem to help with just a little bit. I have used glossy monitors which are much more reflective than this one. It is also a touchscreen, if that's your thing. I've never really seen the benefit in a traditional laptop like this that doesn't fold flat or isn't a hybrid, but if you like using a touchscreen, this is a touchscreen. And it is compatible also with the Asus Pen 2.0, which if I'm going to use the touchscreen on here, it is to do a super quick doodle or to sign a quick document and that sort of thing. One of the biggest issues people had with last year's model was the fact that it was limited to just 60 hertz. They have fixed that this year 120 hertz with VRR as well. One small quirk which is worth mentioning, and I think it's due to the fact that this is a touchscreen, is in certain dark areas, shadows, that sort of thing. If you get super close, you can see a sort of a texture, a graininess to the display. It's not distracting and you don't notice it at all at normal viewing distances. I don't anyway, but you know, can't really see much at the best of times. But I just figured it was worth mentioning. Overall though, it is a really stunning display and it's easily the best I've ever seen in a laptop device. And it really does help to make this P16 stand out amongst the crowd. Under the hood, we have the AMD Ryzen AI9 HX370 and it's a solid performer. In Cinebench 2024, we get a multi-core score of 1093 and a single-core score of 113. That puts it just above the M3 Pro in terms of multi-core and just behind in terms of single-core. It's pretty close to the desktop level Ryzen 7 7700X. However, it does get a little bit stomped by my MacBook Pro M4 Max, which let's be honest, as far as CPUs go, is a beast. Now this model, it's the top-end one, is specced with the maximum 64GB of LPDDR5X RAM, running at 7500MHz. And as mentioned, that is the maximum. So there's no 128GB here, 64GB is the most. That memory also isn't user-upgradable. But the real star of the show is of course that Nvidia 5090 laptop GPU, with its 24GB of GDDR7 VRAM and 1824 AI tops for all of your AI accelerated goodness. And the best news of all, especially for us video editors and creators, is that these new 50 series of GPUs now finally have hardware acceleration for 422 10-bit footage. Which means timeline performance, even using 4K, 6K, 8K, 422 10-bit, is buttery smooth. Now it's not just general timeline performance, because GPU heavy effects like the film look creator and noise reduction are handled extremely well as well, due to the sheer horsepower of this 5090. It can blast through most of them, giving you generally real-time playback even at 4K. And thanks to all of those AI tops I mentioned earlier, all of the AI accelerated features within DaVinci Resolve Studio are super quick as well. Magic masks, even the new Magic Mask 2, which is generally slower than the old version, really quite nippy. It's a good two or three times faster than my MacBook M4 Max. Face refinement, same story. Super scaling is super quick too, and has the Nvidia super scaling option. Even speed warps, which are notoriously heavy and can make even the most powerful systems really start to chug, do pretty well. 4K speed warp better, does start to drop some frames, but lower the timeline resolution scale down to half, and you're back to real-time playback. Now if you like benchmarks, you like hard numbers, good friends over at Team 2 Films have created a DaVinci Resolve benchmark tool, which you can use. While the P16 did the free timeline in 4 minutes 30, the CPU timeline in 4 minutes 27, and the studio timeline in 4 minutes 45. Compared to my M4 Max MacBook Pro, the MacBook was a little bit quicker in both the free and CPU timelines, but was a fair chunk slower in the GPU heavy studio timeline. Now for a bit more of a real-world test, we've got the MacBook and we've got the P16 lined up here. We've got a five minute timeline within DaVinci Resolve, consisting entirely of 6K open gate 420 10-bit footage shot with an anamorphic lens on a ultra-wide timeline. We did a very very basic grade, just some balancing, and then we ran that timeline out, h-stop 265. So the MacBook was actually slightly quicker in that instance. We're not really utilizing the power of the 5090, it's just been desqueezed with a small grade. We then did the exact same timeline once again, but this time with the film look creator enabled, giving it a bit more of a look, a little bit of halation and bloom going on. Now we're starting to utilize the power of the 5090, the P16 is starting to step ahead. We then did it one last time with the film look creator enabled, and we used a little bit of noise reduction as well, and one of the shots had a magic mask enabled. The P16, 10 minutes and 36. The MacBook, 27 minutes and 24. So that's a really good conclusion and a really good example to show you. If you're just cutting things up and doing a basic grade, not much difference between the two, but the more GPU heavy effects you start to use, the more of these AI enabled effects that you start to use, then the 5090 does really start to step ahead. Right, next up, let's talk gaming. And while this isn't designed as a gaming laptop, there are better alternatives if gaming is your priority. With the 5090 inside, you would expect that it's pretty solid for gaming. And you would be right. And games look particularly lovely on that OLED display. Now I've tested some of the games that I genuinely play, rather than the ones which run the best or do the best benchmarks. So let's whip through those. First up, Elden Ring. It is actually locked at 60fps anyway, but you can run it at high with ray tracing off at the native resolution to get a mostly locked 60fps. Or lower that resolution a little and you can crank up the ray tracing to high and still get 60. It's also a surprisingly good looking game, especially on this OLED. Next up, Space Marines 2, which looks incredible. It just does. Ultra settings, native resolution, DLSS set to performance, and you'd be looking at around 50 to 60fps. Note that resolution down to 2560 by 1600 and you'll be close to 260 to 80fps. Then start messing around with the frame generation, which works really well in this game, and I don't mind it for games like this. And you can effectively double that, easily clearing 100fps. Plus, this game's great and it looks cool. Borderlands 4, which we all know, runs like a pig on pretty much any system. It's not a particularly well optimized game, as I'm sure you're already aware. So we have to run this at 2560 by 1600, medium settings with DLSS and 2x frame generation to get close to that 120fps. It does still look and play great though, and it's a fun game. Or probably one of my favorite games of all time, which is generally pretty well optimized, Doom Eternal, which, as you'd expect, runs really well. Everything cranks to the max with ray tracing and no DLSS, we get anywhere between 80 to 100fps. Turn off the ray tracing or drop on a little bit of DLSS, you'll get those extra frames and get a solid 120 to 140fps. And overall, as you'd expect, to be honest, it's great for gaming. The GPU does only run at 120W, you can mess around with the settings and give it a bit more if you want to, I haven't bothered. It's technically not the full power of the 5090 laptop GPU, you may get that in a larger gaming style device. But in this P16, trying to keep it cool, trying to keep it smaller and lighter, creates a focus, it runs at 120W, but that is generally plenty enough for pretty much anyone. Now to keep all of that performance in check and keep this thing running cool, this high end 5090 model comes with two fans and a vapor chamber, which do a decent job of keeping things under control, under load. That's not to say it doesn't get hot and it doesn't get loud though because it does. The fans kick in under heavy load and you will hear it. It's not distracting, it's not loud, it doesn't sound like it's taking off like some of the older gaming laptops you might be used to, but you certainly can hear those fans. The bottom will get warm during a decently long export and when doing a bit of gaming, especially in performance mode. The heat is mostly concentrated at the top area of the bottom of the laptop, so it can get a bit warm, especially around the old crotch. I wouldn't be playing Cyberpunk with this thing on my lap for any extended length of time. However, the keyboard and the trackpad generally remain cool, even under heavy load. It's only this top little bar at the very top of the front that will also get warm. Now I also just need to let you know that ASUS have teamed up with these guys over here, GoPro, to bring creators an exclusive offer. Pick up one of the eligible pro art laptops, like this P16 and you'll get a GoPro Premium Plus subscription thrown in for free. Now they did send me this Max 2 8K 360 degree camera to have a little play with and as it's my first 360 degree camera, I've been having loads of fun with it. That GoPro Premium subscription gives you access to the GoPro Cloud, so you can upload all of your footage to the cloud to keep it secure. You can then access the GoPro Cloud via ASUS's own StoryCube Media Management app. You can easily download your media from the GoPro Cloud, even viewing the 360 degree footage directly in the StoryCube app. Navigate all of your GoPro assets by time, device, location or even by activity, because the AI will group them all for you, so it's nice and easy to find. You can then select any of your images or video and drag them directly into DaVinci Resolve or your video editing software of choice. Now if you fancy learning more about the GoPro and ASUS collaboration, simply click the link down in the description below. Right, let's get back to talking about this P16. Design-wise, there's not really all that much to say, to be honest, it's practically identical to last year's model, which is no bad thing because I personally really like the way this thing looks. It's relatively thin and lightweight. It only comes in this matte black color, which I personally quite like, and it does a decent job of hiding any fingerprints and smudges. The only real design to note is the little ASUS ProArt logo in the corner of the lid. I think it's quite stylish and quite understated and won't look out of place anywhere, really. Now the same can be said about the build quality. It feels sturdy, it feels nice, it feels really well put together. There's no real flex either in the keyboard tray or the general chassis, and the lid feels nice and strong as well. There is a little bit of wobble if you give the hinge a good poke, but it's nothing out of the ordinary. It's just a relatively thin and light, nice looking, matte black, well put together premium 16 inch laptop. Yeah, open it up and you will of course find the keyboard, and it's really nice. Actually, I don't have a huge amount to say about the keyboard, to be honest. It's a chiclet style keyboard that doesn't seem to have changed all that much since the previous model. It has a nice layout, the keys are clicky and tactile with good travel, and I can type really quite comfortably and quite quickly. I like this keyboard, I like the layout, I like the size, I think it works pretty well. Yeah, underneath there we have the touchpad, which is a bit of a chunker. It's massive. It has all of your usual windows gestures, two finger swipes and all that jazz. It's not haptic though, which feels like a bit of a shame. Now also on that touchpad is the ASUS dial pad, which is a nice addition. I don't find myself using it all that much, but it is a nice thing to have. Give the top corner a little swipe to enable the dial pad, and then you can use it in a jiffy to change the brightness or the volume on the desktop without having to resort to the function keys, or within Photoshop or DaVinci Resolve, for example, you can use it to do a bunch of different things like whipping around your timeline. Now in terms of ports, on the left we have the ASUS proprietary power port, a HDMI 2.1 port, one USB 4.0 type C port, one USB 3.2 Gen2 type A port, and last but not least your combo audio and microphone jack. That USB 4.0 type C port is capable of up to 40 gigabits of transfer speeds, which makes it super useful when using like an external NVMe SSD. You can run all your media off there, jump into DaVinci Resolve and you'll have no issues at all. It also supports up to 100 watts of power delivery as well, which we'll come back to shortly. On the right hand side we have a full-size SD Express 7.0 card reader, plus a USB 3.2 Gen2 type A port, and another USB 3.2 Gen2 type C port. Now those ports on the right hand side being just 3.2 are slower, they're capable of just 10 gigabits per second, so if you are running an NVMe you'll want to use the port over on the left hand side. Personally I'd love to see at least two 4.0 type C ports because it just makes life much easier. You can plug one in for power or a dock or whatever and then grab your NVMe and know that you are still getting those 40 gigabit speeds if you had a second 4.0 type C port to use. With just one you do feel yourself swapping around just to make sure you're getting the most out of your equipment. So two would be better, but one we can make do with. Speakers, it has some. It does. On either side of the keyboard they are upwards facing, we have six speakers in total, two tweeters and four woofers, and they sound pretty good. They're genuinely solid for all of your video calls, music, gaming, video editing and just general casual consumption. Obviously if you're doing some more sound critical work you'll probably want to plug in some speakers or some headphones or you can connect some headphones via the onboard Bluetooth 5.4. We also have Wi-Fi 7 which is good to see. Obviously you'll need to be set up for Wi-Fi 7 to make use of them, but it's nice that it's here and it does help to future-proof the laptop. I'm personally not set up for Wi-Fi 7, however the Wi-Fi card in my usage has been rapid. I tested it at home and it gets pretty close to saturating my one gigabit line. Storage-wise the P16 can be specced with up to two two terabyte NVMe SSDs which is exactly what this version has right here. They're fast too. The C drive especially giving me reads of nearly 7,000 megabytes per second and write of 6,300 which is actually faster than advertised. The D drive, the second drive does come in a little bit slower but still plenty quick enough. Interestingly they're actually the same drive. It's just that the second PCIe lane is slightly slower. Next up, battery life. It is the Windows laptop Achilles heel. Running that 5090 hard with video editing or gaming you can expect a couple of hours tops. A little bit more if you are video editing is that's generally not quite as intensive as gaming, but if you do need to push it you do need to be working hard on this thing while you're away then you will need to take the 240 watt power brick with you. As an alternative you've also got that type C port which can do up to 100 watts of power delivery as well. I'm a big fan of Windows laptops but I think of them as a desk to desk solution and then more of a notebook in between. It's actually due to one of my favorite features within the MyAsus app and it's the ability to completely shut off that 5090. Transforming this thing into much more of a 16 inch notebook with a solid six to eight hours of battery life doing your normal day to day tasks with still one of the best displays on a laptop I've ever seen. When I'm at home I can plug into my wife's little desk setup if I need to do a little bit of admin powering it with just a 100 watt USB-C charger. I can then jump over to my SimRig, plug it in there for some eye-rating, I get plenty of frames, no issue and yes SimRacing is a new obsession of mine. Just just look at it, it's cool. I can then chuck it in my bag with the charger, bring it into my office to use as my main daily driver workhorse and then if I'm out and about and I just want to browse the web or do again a little bit more admin it's great for that too. So yeah it's not going to last all day under super heavy GPU load, gaming or video editing but with some smart GPU and power management it's surprisingly versatile and way more usable day to day than you might expect for a laptop with this much performance. Now let's talk about price because all of this goodness doesn't come cheap. This exact spec model with the 5090 is listed currently for $3,999 US dollars but in the UK it's going to cost you 4,799 of your fine British pounds so it's pretty ruddy expensive. Now it is comparable to a similarly specced 16 inch M4 MacBook Max however it doesn't matter which way you look at it if you're spending four grand on a laptop that's an awful lot of money. Whether it's worth it to you only you can say. If you're looking at maybe a second device because you've already got a desktop and you just want something for a little bit here and there then this probably is going to be a little bit of overkill but if you're looking for one laptop to do everything it wants to be your desktop at work and your desktop at home with some other stuff in between it's probably one of the best options out there if you can stomach the price tag. So to conclude and wrap this video up it's a really powerful nice looking relatively thin and lightweight creator focused laptop with one of the best displays on the market but it comes at a price. I've been using it for a few weeks and I've really been getting on with it for all of the stuff that I do a little bit of gaming and some general editing and there's the stuff that I do to run this YouTube channel. I think it's a really really solid performer it's just whether the price makes sense for you. Now I actually edited this entire project on this laptop it's all 6k open gay 10 bit 420 footage from a Lumix S5 Mark II and if you'd like to know how long this actually took to render it will be down in the comments section below. That's it from me thanks once again to Asus for sending this over and sponsoring this video thanks for watching take it easy I'll see you next time.
