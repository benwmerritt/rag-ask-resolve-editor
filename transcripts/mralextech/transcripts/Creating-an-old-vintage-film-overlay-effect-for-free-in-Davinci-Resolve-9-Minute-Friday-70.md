Yes, what up folks? It's Alex here and welcome to 5-ish minute Friday, slowly longer than usual this one. Now in this video though, I am going to show you how to create that really cool old aged vintage film effect within DaVinci Resolve. Now we're not going to touch on the color grading side of things, I'm just going to use a LUT for this video. There's loads of great tutorials out there already showing you how to create that color grading effect. Instead, what I'm going to focus on is the actual visual artifacts and that sort of thing. Now we're going to do all within the Edit tab using completely free effects. We're not going to use any overlays and we're not even going to step foot into Fusion either. Now the LUT we're going to use is available from FreshLut.com, it's linked down in the description below. You can go there, you can download it and you can apply it and use it completely for free. Also down in the description is the link to my video I made in the past on using Fresh Lut. Follow that video, it will show you how to download them and how to install them within your DaVinci Resolve. Right, with all that out of the way, let's crack open DaVinci Resolve and take a look, shall we? So here we are in DaVinci Resolve and we're on the Edit tab and I've already got my timeline set up as normal. So the very first thing we're going to do is open up the Effects Library, expand the toolbox, we're going to come down to Effects and then we're going to grab an Adjustment Clip and we're going to put that above our footage like so. We're just going to lengthen that out to be the same length as our clip. Now what we're going to do now is apply our LUT. So for now I'm just going to go to my Adjustment Clip, click on Color, I've got my LUT open here and I've got the one I'm going to use which is called Memories, we're just going to double click to apply that LUT like so. Then we're going to shoot back into the Edit tab. So now we've got this nice faded look, we can start to add some effect. So with the Effects Library still open, toolbox, then we're going to go to Open Effects this time. We're going to scroll down until we see the Resolve FX Stylize area and we're going to start off with the scan lines. So just drag that onto your Adjustment Clip like so. So give the Adjustment Clip a click, open up the Inspector, shoot into the Open Effects tab and then you've got all the different options for the scan lines within there. Now ignore the first few, come down to Color. What I like to do is just to change these offsets. So we've got red, green and blue. So if I just reduce the red one, you'll see you get this little red line underneath. You can do the same with greens and blues and just play with those until you've got a look which looks right for you. So I'm going to go with about that. Now the scan lines, there's not quite enough of them, they're a little bit fat and chunky. So we're going to scroll up until we see the line frequency. We're just going to increase that just to make them a little bit smaller. Now it can be hard to see this, so what I recommend you do, set it to something, I'm going to go with about 16 and then we're going to hit Ctrl and F on our keyboard to go full screen. And then we've got a slightly better idea of how it's going to look. So I'm happy with that, 16, 18, something around there seems to work well. So we're done with our scan lines. We're going to go back to our Open Effects, we're going to scroll down until we see Film Damage and then we're going to drag that and add that one to our Adjustment Clip. Again, Inspector, Open Effects, you'll still see the scan line. So just double click at the top to minimize that, double click on Film Damage to open that one. And then we've got all of our settings in here. First thing you want to play with is the Film Blur. So you can have loads of Film Blur, but you can reduce it right down. I'm going to go with 0.1 because it blurs it nicely, but we can still see our scan line. So that works for me. We can then adjust the temperature shift and tint shift if we want to. We can mess around with the vignette so we can increase and decrease the vignette. And then we can also play with the dirt. So if you just increase this dirt density, you can see it better. So we've got these big pieces of dirt here. And if we hit play, you can see them darting around the screen. So I'm going to go with about 2 because I don't want them to be too visible. But again, feel free to experiment with all these settings as you wish. And then we've also got Scratch. So I don't know if you can see, there's a line just over here that's darting back and forth. That's our Scratch. We can disable it if we don't want to. And then we can also mess with the color, the positioning, the width. And we can even add additional scratches if we want to. So again, feel free to experiment with them as you wish. I'm just going to leave the one default as it is for now. So this is starting to look a little bit more like it. What we're going to do next, scroll down even further until you see Camera Shake and apply that until your adjustment clip. So again, open effects or close the scan lines. We'll go to Camera Shake. What I'd like to do for this one, come down to the Shake Quality and change it from Cine to Square Wave. Then put the randomness scale right up to the top. And if we hit play, it's going to be really jittery jumping around all over the place like so. It's going too quick for us. So at the very top here, you've got Motion Scale and Speed Scale. So motion is how much it's going to move and speed is the speed that it's going to move. So I'm just going to change that to 0.2 and then the speed scale also to 0.2. But again, feel free to experiment with these. Get something that works for you. I just like those little bumpy movements every now and again like that. Now the very last one to apply, we need to scroll back up and we're going to apply Stop Motion. But we're not going to apply this to our adjustment clip. We're going to apply this to our actual footage. We're going to give our footage a click. Same thing, Inspector, Open Effect. And then you've got this frame repeat. So I'm just going to set this to 10 so you can see what it's doing. And it's going to repeat every 10 frames, which is going to give us this really jittery Stop Motion look. Now we don't want it to be quite that jittery, but I'm going to set it to be about three. And then it's just going to repeat every three frames, which gives it a much less smooth jittery sort of look, which makes it look more like film. So we're nearly there. The last thing to do is just to change our aspect ratio to add our borders on the left and right hand side. Now there's loads of ways that you can do this with overlays and that sort of thing, but I've got a nice easy way which seems to work well for me. Go back to your adjustment clip again. This time in the Inspector, shoot over to the Video tab. Scroll down until you see the cropping area and expand that. And then what we're going to do is just reduce this softness until we get a decent border at the top and bottom. So about minus 40 seems to work well. And then we're going to adjust the crop left and crop right. So we're going to crop in. I'm going to go with about 240. And we're going to 240 on the right as well. And now we've got this nice looking frame with our black edges on the left and right side. If you want to, I quite like to add a little bit of angle. Let's go with one degree of angle as well. It just makes it look a little bit jankier. And there we go. Now if your frame doesn't quite fit your footage, you need to make any changes you can do. Just click on your footage in the Video tab, transform. You can do all your usual adjustments like zooms, positions, angles, do whatever you want to do to make your footage fit. Now, of course, you may want to save this to use as a later date. So give your adjustment clip a click. Once again, Inspector, this time video at the top, you've got effect and name. I'm going to call this old film look. I've got a power bin set up. Again, if you don't know about power bins, check the description. There's a link in there to one of my previous videos. We're going to grab our old film look, put that into our power bin. And there it is. And now whenever we want to apply this visual effect, we can do we just open our power bin from any other project, drag it onto our timeline, hit play. And there we go. Easy peasy, job done. Now, of course, nothing I've done is setting stone, experiment with all of the different options, settings and effects to get a look which is right for you. And that's it for this video.
