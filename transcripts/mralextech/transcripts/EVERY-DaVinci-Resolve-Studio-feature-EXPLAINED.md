Buckle up because this is a big one. I'm going to take you through a bunch of the features that come within DaVinci Resolve Studio because I figured thanks to it being on offer, lots of you are jumping on board with Studio so now seems like a pretty good time. But while this video is a particularly long one, the idea is to just spend a small amount of time on each of the features to kind of show you that they're there, give you a rough introduction as to what they do and how they work so you can get stuck in and start having a play for yourself or do some more research in the manual or on YouTube to learn some of the ins and outs. I want to give you a kind of rough introduction to a bunch of stuff in one video so here we go. We're also going to be taking a quick look at this awesome new way to find music fast called Hands AI by this video's sponsor, Audio. But more on those a little bit later. Right, with all that out the way, let's open up DaVinci Resolve Studio. I'm on 19.1 by the way and get started and we're going to kick things off with Analog Damage. Give your footage a cool retro kind of VHS style aesthetic just like this in an instant with loads of customizable controls. From the edit page, open up the effects library, come down to open effects. I'm going to use my little magnifying glass and we'll search for Analog Damage. There it is. Drop it on your footage. Job done. Give it a click. Open up the inspector. Open effects. Analog Damage. We've got some presets like Clean VHS, Old VHS, Securities Camera, 1970s, 1960s color. You can pick from those and then you've got a bunch of different controls like color dials, scans, scan lines, TV construction and VHS. You can go wild playing with these to create the look that you like. Not something you'll use all the time but when you need it, super useful to have. Tilt, shift, blur. You can use this to create dreamy miniature style effects, particularly useful in drone footage or you can simply use it to guide your viewers eye to key areas. It's like a professional grade, bokeh-ish style blur. Edit page, effects library. Open up the toolbox. Go to open effects and simply search for tilt, shift, blur. Grab your tilt shift. Drop it on your footage. Give that footage a click. Open up the inspector. Effects, open effects. You've got all of your controls within there. Underneath your preview window, click on the drop down to the bottom left and come down to open effects overlay and you'll get the on-screen prompt. You simply put the X as the area you want in focus and then you can change your outer focus areas by grabbing the circle and spinning it round. Here's me using it in a drone style shot to create that miniature style look. Or if we go into this one here, we'll do the same thing. Tilt, shift. Right in the right spot, we want it to be the focus on the director's name and the focus to fall off. We can come and we can change the in focus range. So actually less of it is in focus. Hit play and there we go. Now you can also apply this from the color page. So if I jump over to the color page within the effects library, find tilt, shift, blur and drop that on your node. You get the same on-screen control. What you can also do is use the FX tracker to track a point. I'm going to come down to my tracker here, switch to FX, click on this icon to get the small little blue X on screen. Let's track the name over here and then we're simply going to hit track. Now if we hit play, it's going to track like so. Super quick and easy. Lens correction. Simply fix any kind of lens distortion. Whether you're shooting on a GoPro for example, you've got slightly warped edges or a fisheye lens, you can fix it really quickly using lens correction. Or alternatively, you can use it as an aesthetic kind of choice if you want to add some more distortion to your footage. Edit page, simply click on the footage on the timeline, then open up the inspector, top right hand corner, come down to lens correction and toggle that on. Then you've got a manual slider. So we can move this to the left or to the right to change the distortion. Or you can hit analyze. It'll analyze your footage and apply the amount of distortion it thinks is correct. And then you can simply hit play and off you go. Smart reframe. If you want to reframe some footage for a vertical timeline, let's say it's for Instagram, YouTube, TikTok or whatever, you can do that really quickly and easily using smart reframe. So I have a vertical timeline here on the edit page and if we hit play, you can see that my football player here is not being tracked. So if we click on our footage on the timeline, open up the inspector, video, transform area, we've got smart reframe. Then simply hit reframe. It's going to use AI to search through the footage to find the main subject which is identified as our football player. And now if we hit play, it's simply going to track that throughout our clip. Meaning this is ready for social media. Now it's not always perfect, it may not always get your subject. If it hasn't, what you can do is change the object of interest to reference point, open the drop down underneath your preview window and go to smart reframe. And then you just need to put this box over the subject and it will track that instead. Now as a quick demonstration, just to show you exactly what this is doing, I'm going to turn this back to a regular timeline. And if we hit play, you can see it's simply moving the entire footage left and right to keep your subject in the middle so that it appears within a vertical timeline. Transcriptions. To venture resolve will transcribe your clips, which basically means it'll listen to the footage and then give you it as a script as text. And then you can edit via text. From the edit page, you simply need to open up the media pool, find the footage you wish to transcribe. You can do this for multiple clips at once. Simply right click, come down to audio transcription and then click transcribe. Resolve or analyze the clips and then give you your transcription. With the transcription window open, you can click this icon here, which will identify and then delete any empty spaces. So pauses. And then you can also come in and highlight anything and hit delete or backspace to remove it like so. If I then select all this text and then click this icon down here to append, it's going to drop all of that footage on my timeline. So we can select the footage, delete things and then add it directly to our timeline. You can also do this for the timeline itself. In the top left hand corner, there's this icon to switch to the timeline. Now we can see the transcription of the timeline itself. So if I wanted to remove some lines from the actual timeline, I can highlight them, hit delete and it'll delete them from the timeline. We now have an empty space. So we click on a remove empty spaces button and it'll close those gaps. Now you can tell if a clip has already been transcribed because in the media pool, you'll get this little icon. And if you want to remove the transcription, you simply right click, come down to audio transcription and you can clear the transcriptions. From here, you can also import from subtitles and enable the speaker detection. Subtitles. There's exactly what it says on the tin. We'll go through your timeline and create subtitles for you. From the edit page, we're going to click on timeline at the very top and then come down to create subtitles from audio. We get a few options like the language. You can leave as auto or you can manually select the caption preset. The maximum number of characters per line and how many lines you want and the gaps between the subtitles and then simply hit create. The subtitles will be created on a new subtitles track. If you give them a click, you can open up the inspector, come to video caption. You can see all the individual captions and you can amend them as required. If we click on track, we can also then amend the general font, size, color and the formatting of all of our subtitles across our timeline. If you need to upload these to say YouTube, what you can also do is right click on the subtitles track down here on the timeline and then come down to export subtitle. If you are doing this for YouTube, make sure you select subtitle files without formatting, SRT and you'll be good to go. Obviously, that's all done using AI and that's what I want my AI to do. Make my life easier and not actually take me away from the creative process. It's like finding music. Imagine you could just describe the scene, please chasing after bank robbers and AI will do the rest. This one sounds pretty good. Or how's about this one? And that's all possible thanks to this video's sponsor, Audio and their latest AI feature called Hands AI. Simply describe your scene or the music you're looking for in natural language and Hands AI will search Audio's massive library of music to find exactly what you're looking for. And you can get access to all of Audio's music and sound effects plus these AI features and their brand new iOS and Android apps with the Audio Pro license which is available for just $24.99 per month or annually and if you use the code ALIX70 you get your first year for just 59 bucks. There's links down in the description below so you can go and check it out for yourself. Right, let's crack on and jump straight into the next DaVinci Resolve Studio feature. Face detection. Search through all of your footage for faces so then you can tag them and automatically sort to your footage. Really useful if you've got tons and tons of footage from let's say a narrative, you need to identify your actors or your cast or for weddings. Highlight your footage within a bin, within the media pool, right click and come down to analyze clips for people. It will search through your clips and identify any faces. Then this people window will appear and then you can name all of your people. This is going to be Claire and this is going to be Steve or whatever and we can name the additional ones. Then I can simply click on Claire to see all of the clips that contain Claire's face and go to Steve to find all of the clips containing Steve. If we close this down, what I also recommend you do is click on DaVinci Resolve top left, come down to preferences, user at the very top, editing, tick the automatic smart bins for people and then click save. Then within your smart bins that should appear within your media pool, if they don't you click on these three little dots and come down to show smart bins. Under people you have all of the people that you've tagged. So rather than having to open up the facial detection area, you've got these folders which are super easy to find. I go Claire, there she is, drag her onto the timeline and off we go. Audio classification. Not dissimilar to facial detection but rather than faces, it's different types of audio as well as the subcategories for that audio. So you can sort out a big folder of just stuff, music, sound effects, foley, dogs barking, whatever and it'll categorize it accordingly making your life easier. So I've got a bin here full of different types of audio. I'm going to highlight all of them, right click, come down to audio classification and then click analyze. Once it's finished analyzing, once again within the smart bins, expand the collections and you'll see we've got dialogue, music, effects, silence and then we've got subcategories. If we open these subcategories, we've got animals, breaking, clicking, clink, dialogue, dog, effect, glass, human, impacts and laughter. All of these have been created automatically depending on the type of sound effects that I've got. So yours will look completely different. Scene, cut, detection. Build up your own workflow by automatically finding cuts in pre-rendered clips so you can treat it as a regular kind of timeline. So I've got this rendered out clip on my timeline. You can see there's no cuts in here whatsoever. Then from the edit page, we're going to come up to timeline and then come down to detect scene cuts. That's going to whip through the timeline pretty quick detecting the scene cuts. And now we've got our timeline that's all been cut up nicely so wherever there was a change of shot, maybe I punched in or changed to a screen recording or whatever, it's made a cut on our timeline so then we can simply delete any sections that we no longer need. IntelliTrack. Imagine tracking but more intelligent. That's basically it. IntelliTrack uses AI to help find the actual subject and track that rather than simply looking for like a contrast point. This means that it should be better at keeping track of a subject if it goes behind something else. So we're here on the color page but IntelliTrack also features infusion and fairlight as well. But we'll keep it simple for this demonstration. I'm going to simply select my node, come down to the tracker which is this icon here and then select the FX tracker. Although this also appears within the stabilizer as well. Change the point tracker drop down to IntelliTrack. Then click this icon here to enable the on-screen tracking point. Then drag your tracking point to your subject and then simply track forwards and backwards using this icon here. And it'll try and track your subject throughout the clip. Now this is a relatively simple example but it's done a really nice job even keeping hold of our runner when he runs behind this lamppost or tree or whatever it is. And because this is the FX tracker I can grab something like the radial blur. Let's punch this all the way in and if I grab this center point and attach it to that tracker and then hit play and then our effect, radial blur in this instance is going to follow our track just like so. Magic masks. Magic masks. This is a popular one. You've probably already heard about this one but simply it allows you to track and mask subjects in an instant. It's designed to recognize people as well as a bunch of different objects as well. So once again we're sticking with the color page but again magic masks is also available within Fusion. I'm going to click on my footage. I'm going to come down to this icon here which is the magic masks and then we've got these options. I recommend at this point you click this icon here to enable the overlay and then all you need to do within the preview window do a little squiggle to highlight your subject. It's already been identified. It's put the red sort of overlay on there and then I click this icon to track it backwards and forwards. There's also a faster and better option but I'm going to leave it as faster so we'll hit track and it's going to do some magic mask tracking for us. Once that's done we can turn off our overlay and then use any of the color page controls to make changes to whatever's being tracked. If you want to invert it there's this icon right here to the top right of the magic masks to invert our selection and if we need to make any changes to the mask let's zoom in and let's say we want to make this edge a little bit softer. We can change things like the radius, the blur radius and clean up the black and the white. The white is referring to the subject itself with the black areas being everything that hasn't been within our magic mask area. If you want to get rid of the background what you can do is right click within the nodes come down to add alpha output which will put this blue little dot over here and then if you drag the blue to the blue we end up with that background removed and we only have the subject that's been magic masked like so. Again invert it to get rid of it, job done. Next up depth map. Now depth maps are not dissimilar to magic masks but rather than identifying a particular subject and then kind of getting rid of everything else you can use depth maps to map out the depth within your shot and then apply effects using that depth map. So instead of having a hard cut like magic masks you can have things kind of gradually fade in and out which is more realistic for certain things like background blur and that sort of thing. It's dead easy to enable from the effects library on the colour page simply search for depth map drop that on your node give it a second and it will identify everything within the frame. So I can change my quality to faster because it's a bit easier for this demonstration and if we hit play anything that's highlighted in white is our foreground and anything that's black is our background and anything that's kind of shades of grey is that in between. If we enable our map levels we can change the far limit so we can kind of bring that out of focus area forwards or we can change our near limit like so. So if we wanted to actually use this depth map if I wanted everything that's highlighted white so it's the most affected to be most blurred out and everything else to be nice and in focus adding depth to our shot what I can simply do is right click on our node add node and add a serial or we can use the keyboard shortcut then drag our blue from our depth map to the blue on our new node and if I grab something like the lens blur drop that on there make sure to disable a depth map preview within the depth map and now the lens blur is only being affected on things closest to the frame and it's gradually fading out leaving our subject nice and in focus then you just need to play around with the settings as required and that goes nicely with the next one defocus background. Now I actually think defocus background is also available in the free version but it doesn't make as much sense in the free version because it's best when combined with either the magic masks or the depth map and it allows you to create a nice out of focus background blur like this. So I've already sorted out my depth map let's turn off the depth map preview we'll add a new node as before from the effects library grab the defocus background and we'll drop that on our node like so connect our blue to our blue and we're going to just get a little bit of defocus in the background let's just ramp this all the way up so we can see it a little bit better and we've got a nice kind of defocus background that falls off relatively naturally so this plant kind of remains a little bit more in focus as does the arms of the chest and I think behind once again is nice and blurred using a defocus background once again mesh with the controls if you need to. Lens blur it's there to help you create a kind of out of focus bokeh kind of effects more realistically than some of the standard included in the free version blur effects so rather than Gorsian blur which is kind of just like a murkiness lens blur would actually try and replicate real life lens blur characteristics and once again you can customize it as much as you like. So as before color page we're going to search for a lens blur there it is grab our lens blur pop it on our node give it a click and off we go now as you can see it's applied some blur to this footage you can of course combine this with masking power windows magic masks all those different effects and tracking tools and what not but for this example we're just don't forget on there. Over in the settings we've got things like creative real apertures and you can also use an external input so if you want to use a particular shape for your aperture you can but if we go to real apertures so we've got things like triangle so if you have a look now all of this bokeh is now triangular shaped we can go square we can go pentagon we can go hexagon we can go heptagon and octagon so you can change it as required. We've got speed controls so we can go full half or faster if it's running a bit slow and then we've got all of these customizations here so we can change the size the blade curvature so whether it's got like a harsh edge or it's a bit more round the rotation the anamorphism so you can make it a little bit squished if you're required chroma shift highlights appetization appetization I don't know what that is but you can oh there you go puts a hole in the middle like a cat's eye I think they usually call that there you go you can change that and the catadioctric there you go mess around with those to get the aperture looking however you want it to look with lens blur lens reflections in real life you get reflections when you're shooting usually late at night or there's a particularly bright kind of light source coming in if you're using a vintage lens or maybe an anamorphic lens you'll get these kind of smudges within your shot some people love them because it can have that cinematic sort of look whatever you want to call it you can replicate those using the lens reflection feature in studio lens reflections you know it already color page we're going to search for the lens reflections we're going to grab lens reflections drop it on our node now you can move this around so you grab this point on the preview window and move it to wherever you like but it is looking at the light source and will move in accordance to where the light source is going so if I put this over here you can see my little reflection we've got more coming in now as our subject is getting further away but if you wanted to kind of change the angle change the positioning of this we can do so we can move this where we want it we could track it if we wanted to because this is just an FX so we could use the FX tracker but I quite like it like that just moving around in the frame as per all the other things we've been talking about there's a bunch of controls within the FX area we've got things like the isolation controls which is looking at the individual elements and we can kind of change the brightness the gamma the smoothness the color filter all that sort of stuff we've got global controls so we can change the global brightness the blur the anamorphism and then we can also go through all these individual reflection elements so some of them have got colors like this blue one here if you wanted this to be green we can make that green we can change the defocus the stretch the optical path the brightness all those sorts of things change this to get it looking once again however you like similarly to lens reflections we've got lens flares now on the face of it some lens flares don't look particularly good but this tool in resolve actually has a bunch of different features so there's like a drop down you can choose loads of stuff which makes it really quite cool and quite useful especially if you're trying to replicate like an anamorphic sort of lens flare or you're going for like a 1970s sci-fi thing you can use this to do it sticking with this biker footage once again this time we're going to search for the lens flare and we're going to drop that on there like so on the preview window we've got our lens flare we can actually use these controls to adjust the sizing the strength and move the center point to wherever we want it so i would probably want it on this headlight like so and then we've got this lens flare going on over here now within the effects the settings area there is a lens flare preset and there's some cool ones in here so we can go with an m ir whatever that is don't know what that is some sort of light there is a late afternoon if this is a natural sunlit one there's a headlight which obviously would make sense for this example but we've also got things like 1970s sci-fi like an anamorphic look a modern sci-fi and an anamorphic handicap so you can just select these as you wish let's go 1970s sci-fi just because i like it and then you can also come in here and change the positioning the global corrections once again the global defocus the scaling the colorize result you can also change the aperture blades and the angle as well as changing the glare brightness and the glare color now because this is a lens flare you probably are going to want to track this as well so as we've done with some of the other examples if we go to our tracker turn it to the fx tracker we'll use intelatrack because it's been working well for me so far we'll grab our point let's just move that out the way we'll grab that put it on a headlight let's also attach a light to that like so and then we'll track this throughout the frame our flare will be attached to our headlight and will work pretty well i probably want to come in and keyframe the sizing for this example but you get the idea that's how it works aperture diffraction if you wear glasses like i do and you go out at night you'll know exactly what this is because this is probably how you see the world and it's when you get these kind of stars these star shapes around light sources it's usually caused by shooting with a small aperture at an intense light source and you get these star kind of light shape things within your footage you can replicate that using the aperture diffraction color page effects library we will search for aperture there it is aperture diffraction drop it on our node and again it will just instantly give us our star kind of effects over our lights there's actually tons of controls for this one you've got things like the brightness the gamma the smoothness the color filter for the actual isolated color areas and then you can also change your aperture controls so we've got a hexagonal aperture at the minute we can change that to be triangle we can change the aperture size the blade curvature the rotation the horizontal and vertical ratio if you wanted to go for a more of like an anamorphic sort of effect all that sort of stuff within here you can customize to get this looking however you want it remote monitor is an application it's a way of you kind of broadcasting your clean feed from your installation of DaVinci Resolve Studio to someone else so they can review it they can monitor it and they can have a look at your color grade and that sort of thing this is a professional application generally speaking because i can't imagine like people like me every day users really need this but it's a cool feature that's worth talking about it can be useful if you want to have a quick look at how your video is going to look on an iPad or on your phone or whatever so there are some practical uses and overall it's pretty easy so within DaVinci Resolve Studio i'm just going to click on workspace at the very top and i'm going to come down to remote monitoring that's going to open this remote monitor little window down here in the bottom right i can change the video codec this will depend on what sort of system you're using let's just go with 264 and we can change the bitrate i can also enable automatic accept connections if i want to and then i simply hit start session now you'll notice you've got this unique code at the top you just need to send that to your client so they can log in and see the feed so here i've got my iPad with the remote monitor app installed i've entered that session code i can simply hit join i would have to accept that if i hadn't ticked the automatic button but i did and there you go now we can see that on there anything i do on the timeline as i whip around go to different things i can jump over to the color page and start doing some grading on this and it's just going to appear on the remote monitor like so shot match shot match is like an automatic color grade stealer kind of thing you can point it at one clip and it'll try and figure out the grade and what's going on and apply it to another clip the downside is you don't see all of the controls it just kind of does it for you and then you have to carry on from there but it is a really clever tool that's worth mentioning so we're on the color page once again now none of these clips have been graded at all in DaVinci Resolve but i've got a pre-rendered clip which has got the grade on it so here's the original and here's the graded one what i can simply do is click our ungraded clip right click on our graded clip and there is an option shot match to this clip and what DaVinci Resolve will do is bake in a grade on this clip that's designed to look as close as it can to its original and as you can see it's done a pretty good job now Resolve never had the information from this original grade because it's been pre-rendered it's just looked at it and then decided to match the shot as best as it can we can then grab this one which is from the same series but hasn't yet been graded at all same thing we can right click shot match and it's going to change it to match the general tone from here we then need to come in and we'll change our offset and our gain and whatever to balance the rest of our shot oh we could have done the shot match at the end and balance before it you get the idea that's what it does noise reduction this does exactly what it says on the tin DaVinci Resolve studio has a bunch of different controls to help you eliminate noise from your footage grainy grainyness get rid of it so i've got this quite noisy footage in here like so we're on the color page at the moment we're going to click this icon bottom left to open up our motion effects and we've got temporal noise reduction and spatial noise reduction now the difference between these two temporal will look at multiple frames forwards and backwards and then try and kind of guesstimate and figure out which noise to get rid of while spatial looks at individual frames and looks at kind of neighboring pixels if in doubt start with temporal see how that goes and then you can start adding spatial spatial is much heavier to run temporal is a little bit easier all we do enable a couple of frames at how many frames you want to look at the less frames the faster this will run change a few options increase this a little bit and it will start to get rid of some noise like so there's also a new option within the spatial noise reduction if we change the mode to ultra nr that's ultra noise reduction and then hit analyze DaVinci Resolve will search the frame and then try and figure out how much luma and chroma to apply to get rid of that noise so that ultra nr is ai based it's very heavy to run as you can tell but it's a nice kind of one click attempt to get rid of some noise super scale another one that does exactly what it says on the tin super scale will use ai algorithms and fancy stuff to help you kind of blow up footage so if you've got some low resolution footage but you want to work with it on a 4k timeline you can use super scale to enhance that footage so it doesn't look all mushy and muddy and whatever so i've got this low resolution footage on a high resolution timeline we'll give it a click open the inspector come down to super scale toggle that on we've got a bunch of options the more is better but will be harder to run let's just go with 2x enhanced and let's just dump the sharpness and the noise reduction up a little bit and then if we toggle it off that's what it looked like before and if we toggle it on that's what it looks like now so it just helps to enhance that footage to a higher resolution super quick notes about super scale which have enabled it on a clip even if you delete it from the timeline and bring it back in it will still have that super scale on it's also worth knowing if we cut this up and then grab another one again it's all got super scale if we turn super scale off for this one it will turn it off for this one so even though you apply it on the timeline it will always affect that clip so it's kind of like you're baking it in to the actual clip within the media pool rather than on the timeline another way that you can apply it if that's a bit confusing is right clicking the footage within the media pool coming down to clip attributes and then from within the clip attributes there's a super scale option at the bottom and you can change it from there the downside is you can't see the preview quite as easily so you can choose whichever way you prefer voice isolation isolate voices within your footage enabling you to get rid of any background sounds and distracting noises with a simple slider so we're on the edit page i've got this footage here and i've baked in some background noise as well as me talking i was going to try and get in another run got a few bits to go so there's all sorts of stuff going on there if we simply give that footage a click in the inspector we go to the audio tab there is a voice isolation we toggle that on and then we simply get an amount slider 100 is max voice isolation i was going to try and get in another run and it's done a pretty good job but we can just scale this down to get it to be a little bit more natural if we start hearing some weird artifacts within our voice or if we just want some of that natural background noise but not quite as much of it now we can also apply this over an entire timeline track by clicking on our track down here bottom left hand side of the timeline itself then go into inspector audio we've got the voice isolation we toggle that on and off we go dialogue separator this is very very similar to the voice isolation but it just gives you a little bit more control now this one though can only be applied to an entire timeline track rather than individual clips so same place i've actually just disabled the voice isolation we need to click on our track down here so i'm going to use audio one make sure that's selected in the inspector audio we have a dialogue separator we toggle that on and it does a very similar thing except we can control the volume of the voices the backgrounds and the ambience ambience being things like echo and room tone so if we just bring these down and bring the voice up for example and then hit play i was going to try and get in another run a few with kind of balance that audio a little bit more but if we want to get rid of all of the background sounds we can just mute it i was going to try and get in another run and there you go so dialogue separator gives you a few more controls the voice isolation is kind of on or off and then you just use one master slider to figure it out music remixer if you don't have access to the stems so you don't have access to like the voice and the different elements of a music track but you do get stems if you've signed up for this video sponsors audio pro license that i talked about earlier link in description segue then you can use the music remixer to do that sort of stuff intervention resolve so you can basically mute voices mute guitar bring up the bass whatever you need very easy to apply once again we've got this music track on our timeline give it a click open up the inspector music remixer toggle that on then you've got some sliders for voice drums bass other than guitar and then you can also mute all of those so if we simply hit play at the moment nice obvious vocals let's just go back a little bit where we'll mute the voice and now this track has no vocals we want to mute the drums we can mute the drums we want to bring up the bass we can bring up the bass and then you can just customize that as you need to speed warp speed warp allows you to slow down footage to look like slow motion even if it wasn't shot with a high frame rate so usually when you try and do that you end up with janky footage kind of like this but speed warp will use kind of AI and stuff to fill in those gaps to make it look a lot nicer and a lot smoother edit page once again we've got this clip here of this skateboard guy so we're going to give it a click open up the inspector speed change let's knock this down to about 20% and it will of course look nice and janky then scroll down to retime and scaling open that up retime process you want this to be optical flow this tries to do the same thing but it just blends the frames together it can work quite well if you're not slowing things down massively but it's not perfect then in the motion estimation we've got speed warp faster and speed warp better so let's just go with speed warp faster for this demo and now if we hit play you can see it is filling in those blank frames for us and it's actually doing a pretty good job that looks pretty good you will get some artifacts you will get some slight strangeness here and there but overall it's not too bad surface tracker track surfaces obviously this allows you to kind of track surfaces like cloth or flags or clothing or whatever quite naturally and then you can pin things to it super useful for kind of replacing logos or even putting a logo on a piece of clothing or whatever so surface tracker we've got this guy's shirt and we want to track it so the first thing we need to do from the color page within effects simply search for the surface tracker and drop that on your node like so now there's a bunch of different controls within here you can do a lot to customize this but let's keep it nice and simple the first thing you need to do is draw a mesh on your preview window just by clicking around to create this mesh this is what's going to track the individual movements of your cloth or flags or whatever if we go to mesh we can actually increase the number of tracking points within here and mess with all of those settings and then if we go to track we can track this mesh so we click on this icon here to track forwards and backwards and it's just going to run through the clip tracking all the individual points within our mesh to create our surface tracker there are also additional tracking controls within here once that's done we just need to add the thing we want to put onto that surface tracker so i'm going to open up my media pool i've got this stupid png of my face so we're going to bring this in and then all we need to do is link this green box to the second green input of our surface tracker and it's going to put that on the mesh like so and as you can see it's kind of following and it's bending and it's warping and it actually looks pretty good we do need to make it look a little bit better so if we go back to our surface tracker we click on result at the top there's a bunch of things you can do from within here so if we zoom right in first off at the very top we can change the sizing of the mask we can change the softness and we can also add some motion blur if we want to in overlay placement click on go to reference and it'll take you to the reference frame from here we've got this sort of corner pinning so we can change the perspective warp this as much as we like and if we scroll down to compositing we can change the opacity which can make it look obviously a little bit more realistic and also change the composite mode i'm just going to leave mine looking something like that and if we hit play there's your surface tracker done with a new logo or whatever added on top pretty simple really relight relight is a fancy tool which allows you to put kind of artificial lights in scenes and it will try and do an almost kind of depth map but rather than looking at the depth it will look at where the light's coming from and then try and do kind of natural shadows and fall off you then control it using the standard controls within the color page so we're going to search once again for relight and we'll drop that on our node and then within our preview window we get this we can just drag this around and as you can see it's kind of trying to map where the shadows would be there's a bunch of controls within here you can change it to be a directional light source a point source or a spotlight and you can change the reach the contrast the glossiness and all that sort of stuff i'm going to leave that just there for now we'll turn off the relight mapping preview and then we can just go to our color wheels for example we can boost this up and maybe give it a bit of gain we could change the color we could do whatever and as you can see it's brightening this side of his face but leaving this side of his face as it is because that side is naturally in shade and that is the relight tool texture pop i know a lot of colorists are a big fan of this texture pop tool you need to be very careful when using it because you can go overboard with it so i'm not going to actually really tell you how to use it but i wanted to mention and kind of show you that it was there from the color page once again within the effects search for texture pop here it is drop that on there like so and again if you're familiar with photoshop or lightroom it's called clarity within there so if you bring this up let's zoom in you change the details we can get this sort of look so it's adding this texture to our footage we can change the operating mode to advanced and when we get loads of different controls we can add this texture to the rough areas the course the medium the small the fine the tiny but as mentioned you need to be careful otherwise you will ruin your footage go watch darren talk about this darren mason or another colorist that'll explain it far better than i will right this is a long video but hopefully you're finding it really really useful next up we've got a bunch of kind of smaller fixes these are color page effects which are only available within the studio version which you don't necessarily use for creative purposes but it can be super handy for fixing things and we're going to start off with patch replacer the patch replacer is like a clone tool if you've ever used photoshop you kind of know what this is and it's a really quick tool for getting rid of something from usually from like a static wall maybe you've got a plug socket or you've got a light on the wall and if you've got another area you want to kind of paint it over with super quick and easy to do that using the patch replacer tool so we've got this footage here and we've got this annoying light kind of ruining uh background whatever it's a relatively static shot which is how this patch replacer works best although you can track it but there's object removal for that which i'll show you in a second so if we search for the patch replacer we drop that on our node we simply get these two little kind of windows appear and it's got an arrow to show us which way it's going bunch of controls within here we can change the shape and the edges and whatever and we can just go i want that bit to be replaced by that bit over there so we move these to get these roughly lined up just turn off the overlay and that's done a pretty good job as mentioned there's not much movement in this if there was we'd have to go about tracking it but for a quick static shot like this super quick and easy object removal similar to patch replace but it kind of does it automatically and it's super useful for moving objects because that's all built into it and it's useful if you haven't got a nice area to copy from which the patch replacer does well this uses ai to kind of do it all for you so we've got this drone shot hovering around here and doing a patch replace wouldn't work all that well so the first thing we need to do we need to track our object so i'm going to go to my tracker tool i'm just going to grab a pen for this one we're going to use the pen tool and we're just going to do this super quick and rough to create a little window then we go to the tracker icon make sure we're on window and then we're going to track and it's going to do its best to track our drone which is done pretty well then we're going to search for object removal and drop that onto our node then we hit scene analysis and it's going to analyze the scene and do its best to get rid of the thing that we've been tracking now if you end up with a gray box like this all you need to do scroll down to the bottom and hit build clean plate and there you go it'll fill in the gap now there are a bunch of different options within here once again you kind of have to mess around with them to see which works best you may need to blur the edges of your window and all that sort of thing we can mess around with the analysis boundary and then do another scene analysis to see if that looks any better and then if we just turn off our window hit play we can see it obviously because we're looking directly at it but let's go and maybe soften the edge of this just a smidge something like that if you weren't looking for it it's not that easy to spot so there you go object removal beauty like beauty and the beast beauty beauty is a plug-in a tool and effects whatever you want to call it within DaVinci Resolve which allows you to control texture technically it will work on any footage you can put it on whatever you like and start messing around either adding texture or removing texture which also kind of means adding smoothness but it's kind of there it's kind of designed to be used on skin so you can beautify the skin a little bit by making it smoother and removing blemishes and that sort of thing it's kind of been replaced by the face refinement tool but it does have loads of additional controls so maybe some people that do lots of skin retouching still make use of this beauty tool got this footage and we want to smooth out the skin so the first thing we need to do in the effects area we're going to search for beauty on the color page once again we're going to grab this tool and drop it on our node now it's kind of hard to see but if we toggle this off and on it's just adding a bit of smoothing but it is adding it to everything within the frame it's not actually looking for skin it's just applying it to everything so it is recommended that when you're using the beauty tool you actually use like a qualifier to pick out the skin so I'm going to click on this icon up here in the top left highlight then grab my qualifier make sure that's turned on and then we can just sort of very roughly pick up the skin which we want to be affected using our beauty tool then within beauty there's a bunch of options the first thing at the very top there's this advanced option so you can actually change it to an automatic mode which if you just want to do something really quick is super quick and easy we've simply got an amount slider and then a scale slider so let's just turn this off so we can actually see a little bit better if we crank this all the way up this skin is getting really smooth and bring this all the way down to do the opposite so you can just mess with that and then you can mess with the scale which relates to the size of the details affected we can change this to go advanced which gives us more control we've got the smoothing threshold we can diffuse the lighting we can do texture recovery and feature recovery and then there's also an ultra beauty which gives us tons of additional options smoothing detail recovery texture recovery grain detail edge balance all this sort of stuff so you can really work on this beauty tool to get your subject looking beautiful and stuff so there you go beauty tool face refinement as mentioned in the last one face refinement i think kind of has replaced beauty in some regards but what it essentially does is it tracks faces within your footage and allows you to do loads of really specific face refinement you can add makeup you can change the color of people's cheeks you can wait in that teeth white on their eyes sharp on their eyes and retouch all of the skin and all that sort of thing without having to use a qualifier because all of the tracking is built in let's take a look you've guessed it color page we're going to search for the face refinement grab face refinement and put it on our node like so the first thing you need to do you click on detect faces in frame and it will search the frame for any faces so this does work even if you've got multiple people in the frame like this you get these boxes on the screen and then you just pick the one that you want to do the face refinement on if you need to do it for multiple you just need to use multiple nodes from here we then track using this icon to track forwards and backwards and it's just going to run through your footage and track the features of the face of the person you've highlighted so as you can see we've got the eyebrows the eyes the nose the mouth the chin all that sort of good stuff we can toggle the overlay by clicking on show overlay as required we can then come down to a bunch of different controls so the skin isolation here if we actually toggle this on this shows the face and the skin that's been tracked which I always find looks really funny look like an egg anyway and then we can change the range of the tin to the temple that sort of stuff underneath there we've got tons of controls so we've got skin texture skin grading side lighting eyes shadows eyes lips teeth blush forehead cheeks and chin so for each of these you just open them up and there's a bunch of options this skin texture is very similar to the beauty option you've got an automatic which if we slide that up it just smooths the skin we can change the scale or we can change this to advanced and we get a few more options we've got the grading so we can change the contrast the mid tone the color boost of the skin side lighting eye shadow I find this to be the most impressive we can drag the eye shadow up and then change the color of it and it just works really well and looks genuinely really natural I find that one really impressive for some reason then we've got the eyes sharpening brightening lips obviously we can add some lip color and this that and the other teeth blusher forehead and really mess around with it as you need to to refine the features of the faces within your frame de flicker if you ever shot something with an LED and it's flickering in the background or if you've shot a time lapse and your light sources are kind of flickering around the de flicker tool is there to kind of blur it all together and make it look a little bit nicer and a little bit less distracting super easy to apply color page as before search for the de flicker tool drop that on your footage there's not actually that many options within here there's a de flicker settings time lapse flora light or advanced this one I'm using a time lapse and if we just play this without this there's all these flickering lights on the left during this time lapse if we just enable this node what it's going to do is smooth those out so there's still changes it's just far less distracting same one with this footage here these lights are highlighting this tree it works but it's a bit too flashy we put the de flicker on there and it blends it together and makes it look much nicer if you've got a flora light and I haven't got an example for this but if you've got a flora light you can also limit the analysis area and rather than having to use a power window you can get this kind of on-screen prompt to put it in the area of the light so you're not smudging the whole footage together you're just picking the area where you want this de flicker to be applied de banding similar to de flicker but for banding so if you've ever shot anything maybe at a low bit rate or whatever and you've got banding in the colors or in my instance I actually use this one because it saved my bacon I was shooting something I knocked my shutter speed I had banding in the lights you can fix it all using the de banding tool so we've got this footage here we're on the color page and as you can see there's a bunch of color banding in the corner we've got these weird edges because it can't quite kind of gradually go between the colors nicely now I purposely ruined this footage and added this banding to it so apologies original creator to get rid of that we simply use the deband feature so within effects search for deband there it is drop it on your node and there you go and what it's basically going to do is look for the edges and then kind of blur the lines between them the controls are really simple there's only really three we've got the edge threshold which controls how strong must an edge be to be detected so we can increase that or lower that to adjust kind of the overall threshold we've got the radius which controls how wide is the debanding effect around an edge so again we can bring this up or lower this and then we've got a post refine so this is the smoothing process this one I find has the biggest impact if we bring this right down we do end up with some of this edging back so then we can maybe change the threshold mess with that and then just bring up the post refine to a point that we're happy let's go with something like that so it's a pretty simple one to use just to give you another quick example of the debanding I shot this footage and I knocked my shutter speed so we ended up with this banding within this light here it's not flickering we just ended up with these weird lines so all you need to do you can use the debanding for that as well drop the deband on there same thing it's got rid of those we may be coming in and just lower this because it's a bit harsh mess with it to get it looking about right and there we go we can use that to save this type of footage as well de haze haziness can be used for like an aesthetic choice sometimes I'm actually using a hazy filter at the moment but when you don't want it and it's in your shot you can get rid of it using the de haze feature now it's actually quite clever it does like a mini sort of depth map kind of thing and it controls both color and contrast to allow you to get rid of that annoying haze let's have a look so here we are color page once again we're going to open up effects and we're going to search for de haze there it is nice and easy drop it on your node give your node a click in the settings we only have a few to play with so first of all the obvious one strength so we can bring the de haze strength up and down we've also got haze color so if we need to change the color of this we can because obviously it's being affected by the color of the haze so we can counter that we can take this display depth which just shows us the kind of mini depth map which is being performed to help us de haze our footage and then we can control the shadows and the highlights so because it's hazy you probably want to bring your shadows down and you can maybe bring your highlights up and we've added much more contrast and whatnot to this footage so we've gone from that to that another quick example for you again really hazy here this is looking really low saturation and contrast and whatever because of this sun we dropped the de haze on there that starts to look a bit better already let's go crazy with it maybe bring the shadows down and the highlights up we're not going to mess with colors and again de hazing a sun pretty good job and it also works for kind of man-made haze as well so for this footage here it actually looks pretty good to be honest but obviously there's this smoke and it is making things look just maybe slightly low contrast so if we grab the de haze that's kind of trying to figure it out that's a bit strong so we'll knock the de haze strength down maybe drop the shadows a bit boost the highlights maybe have a play with the haze color make that look a little bit more natural and we've gone from that one to that one just using the de haze tool so there you go de haze dead pixel fixer if you've got a dead pixel on your camera or maybe you had a little bit of dust kind of on the sensor and it's in a particular spot it doesn't move it's static throughout all of your shots because obviously it's on your sensor or on your lens you can use the dead pixel fixer to fix it so this was the best example i could find there's all these specs of dust on this table during the shot now it's all static they don't move so it's similar to if you had a bit of dust on your sensor or a dead pixel or whatever we simply search for the dead pixel within effects on the color page we drop that on our node and then we've got a bunch of options so i want to draw an ellipse so on the preview we can just draw in a little ellipse and it's going to smudge that area together essentially getting rid of these pixels so we can just go through doing all of these do as many as we like we can change all of the options the edges the shape we can draw rectangles rather than ellipses if we need to and then if we just turn off the preview they've all kind of gone if we hit play it looks much nicer so if i just disable that there they are and there you go so get rid of dust bad pixels and other stuff next up dust buster and automatic dirt removal so if you've got any old school footage and maybe it's from a projector and there's kind of hairs in it and dust and all that sort of thing maybe cracks in film or whatever these two tools are designed to fix that so the first one dust buster so we're going to search for the dust buster within the effects on the color page and drop that on there now this is actually very similar to the dead pixel fixer because what you do you actually need to do this frame by frame so with that enabled i would cover up this area this area this area for example again there's a bunch of different controls which you're not going to jump into have a look at the manual for all of these and then you go to the next frame and you do the same thing so you come through and you do all of this frame by frame so that's how you get rid of all of these weird blemishes time consuming but you know the dust buster is there to do that there is an automated way though so let's remove that and instead we're going to search for the automatic dirt removal drop that on there and that does a similar thing but it's designed to try and do it automatically for you so if i show the repair mask it's trying to pick up all of this dust and cracks and other stuff and if we go let's increase the frames and maybe change the size that it's picking up and the repair strength we can go a bit crazy with this and it's doing this frame by frame trying to pick up any oddities there's a fine controls as well so you can change all of that and if we turn that off it's kind of trying to get rid of it now it will obviously blur the footage a little bit but there you go it's useful and it's probably a little bit faster than the dust buster. Motion trails you use motion trails to add motion trails to your footage there's exactly what it says on the tin it's designed to create kind of like a dragged shutter effect if you're trying to do like a drunken scene or you're trying to i don't know someone's on drugs something's going on someone's not very well you might use this motion trails you've guessed it color page search for motion trails drop that on your footage we're using these penguins because all these penguins have been into the meth or something i don't know and as you can see we've got these motion trails so it's kind of like motion blur but it's not designed to be smooth it's designed to just show multiple frames and then you can change the length and the drop off as well as a bunch of different controls within there so that is the motion trails motion blur similar to the motion trails but there is a singular motion blur that you can use now this is specifically designed for if you've shot with too high of a shutter speed for example you've shot to your footage it looks a little bit cranked and that wasn't the intention so you want to apply some motion blur in DaVinci Resolve this motion blur tool is there to do that same place you've guessed it we've got motion blur we're going to stick with the penguins because if you've got footage of penguins you might as well use it we're going to put the motion blur on there and if we hit play you can see it's just adding some motion blur if we toggle that off you can see this is kind of harsh looking and imagine just because of the light they had to crank the shutter up because this was probably very very bright and the motion blur just adds a bit of motion blur to it you can change the amount of motion blur the quality of it so you can go faster or better the motion range and you can also change the direction so at the moment what's happening is it's putting a bit of blur in front of the subject and behind it which isn't technically accurate so if we change that to be from previous frame and then hit play we're only going to get kind of the blur after the subject so if we look at this fellow here as he moves we're getting the blur afterwards like so and it looks pretty good abstraction pencil sketch watercolour and stylize i don't know how often you'll use these they seem they seem like an odd maybe they're doing something in the background which is not available in the free version but anyway these stylistic kind of effects are only in the studio version so let me show you them super quick now all of these exist obviously on the color page but we're going to find them on the edit page within open effects if we just search for watercolour we can drop that on our footage to get a watercolour effect and again in the inspector a bunch of controls within there pencil sketch very similar once again but obviously gives us a pencil kind of effect you can also animate this one from within the inspector so let's turn up the seed length on this and it will look you know take and me kind of like that and then we've also got abstraction drop that on there abstract kind of look going on mess with it until you happy quantize quant quantization do that if you want there you go and stylize now this one's kind of interesting because it has a bunch of styles first of all you can change the style scale so let's just crank this right the way up and then if we use these styles drop down we've got loads in here candy ashville whatever that is then as pronounced that we've got a chinese brush we've got dance feather illustrated portrait you can keep scrolling down lamuse cafe terrace stained glass scream proto cubist portrait great wave all this sort of stuff that you can come in and have a little play with but there you go there's some stuff for you to have a little play with and to finish off this rather long but hopefully very useful video let me know down below is some of the film emulation kind of things that you can create in the venture resolve these are some of my favorites well one of them is which we'll get to in a moment the first one though film grain i don't use it all that much but when i see film grain done well i always think it looks really really nice it wouldn't make any sense for a tutorial on youtube for example but when done right it looks really good and there is a dedicated film grain tool in resolve on the color page so we're just going to search for film grain grab that plunk it on a node and this comes with a bunch of presets we've got 16 mil 8 mil loaded different types of film and all this sort of stuff basically the smaller the mill then the bigger the noise is going to be and if we just crank the opacity and hit play you can see we've got this grain going on we lower this let's go 35 mil it's all a little bit smaller if we only want to see the grain we can toggle that on to have a look at what it's doing and then we can change the texture the size the strength offset symmetry softness saturation as well as all of the colors from within the options here halation halation is a it's a common technique at the moment and during film days you'd get this kind of bleed over high contrast edges that's called halation you can also get this using kind of mist filters that kind of replicates a similar ish not quite but similar enough sorts of effect there is a dedicated halation tool you've guessed it on the color page so this is most noticeable around high contrast kind of bright areas so if we find halation drop that on there we get all of this sort of bleed going on here toggle that on and off and you can see what's going on this little fella down here is a good example so with it on and with it off you get this kind of bleeding around and again there's tons of controls you can change the threshold so what's being affected the film saturation levels so the saturation of the colors the strength gamma if we come down to we can add a bit of grain we can also view the actual glow and then change the highlights we can change the color we can do all sorts of stuff within there and last but not least probably one of my favorites that I've added more recently the film look creator the film look creator kind of combines the halation and the analog damage we looked at earlier to a lesser degree and film grain and some other color grading stuff into one handy tool so that you can create film looks quickly and easily and it's super easy even a color grading idiot like me can create some nice looks with it you can do it on the color page or the edit page I'm going to do the color page and all we need to do is search for the film look creator grab it drop it on there like so that footage to me automatically looks better than it did that's got quite a nice kind of look to it and within the film look creator there's different presets 65 mil 35 mil cinematic we've got a bleach bypass look we've got a nostalgic look you just change them as you need to and then you've got a bunch of other controls if we go back to the default 35 mil there's a film look and there are these looks baked in so we've got cinematic Rochester Akersaka elated and vintage and then we've got some color controls as well so we've got things like exposure contrast highlights fade and then we've got vignette halation bloom grain flicker gateway film gate you just play with these to get the footage looking as you like you can use this within your current kind of node tree plonk it at the end to create a look and then you can grade underneath it use it however you like if you don't want to jump into the color page and mentioned you can even apply it directly from the edit page and then control it from within the inspector within there now there's probably some things I missed there's I think there are things that I haven't covered but I try to cover a whole bunch in this video because I know there's tons of you jumping over to DaVinci Resolve studio so hopefully this has given you loads of things to go and have a play with hopefully there was some things in here that you didn't know about and now you so you can go and get your money's worth of that DaVinci Resolve studio thanks once again to audio for sponsoring this video and for helping to keep Mr Alex Tech alive that's it for this video any thoughts feelings comments or whatever pop them down below thank you ever so much for watching take it easy I'll see you next time
