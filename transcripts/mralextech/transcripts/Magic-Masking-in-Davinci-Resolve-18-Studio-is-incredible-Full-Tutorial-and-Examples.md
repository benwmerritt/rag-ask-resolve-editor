Object tracking in DaVinci Resolve Studio 18 is finally here. That means you can now select and track things in a jiffy and apply some selective colour grading, some fun effects, or even mask things out. And it is very impressive, but it is limited to the paid studio version of DaVinci Resolve. It's not available within the free version. And that's because it's using the DaVinci Noro engine, which leads me nicely into this video sponsor. Nvidia Studio and Scan Computers. Nvidia Studio is a new software and hardware platform utilising technology to make creative work easier and more efficient. RTX Studio high performance systems are loaded with the world's most powerful Nvidia GeForce RTX GPUs. And it's those GPUs which not only drastically improve timeline and rendering performance, but also accelerate that DaVinci Noro engine. Ensuring that you can run all of the brand new DaVinci Resolve 18 effects like the depth map, surface tracker and of course object tracking within Magic Masks effortlessly. And Scan Computers are one of the biggest and most trusted resellers of Nvidia Studio certified products in Europe. So click the link below to check out their line of Nvidia Studio certified laptops, plus their own line of award-winning 3XS Nvidia Studio approved custom systems built specifically for creators. One of which I'm actually using right now. This is my very own Scan 3XS system rocking the Nvidia 3090 and I'm going to be using it to edit and record this entire video. Right with all that other way, Magic Masks is really really clever, but there are a few do's and don'ts when using it to make sure that you're using it correctly and you get the best results. Rather than me running through everything, instead open up DaVinci Resolve, go to Help and you've got the DaVinci Resolve reference manual. Give that a click, jump directly to page 2934 and there's a whole section on Magic Masks. We've got loads of do's and don'ts, how to deal with hair and even a whole section just about hats. So we're going to start with this super duper easy example. We've just got this cat chilling on the wall and we want to give him a little track. So we're going to give this footage a click and then hop into the color page. Now to open your Magic Mask controls, on the little menu right in the middle of the screen here, you want to come over to this icon, the little person with the checkerboard behind it, to open up your Magic Mask. Now it'll default to the Magic Mask Object Controls. If you're tracking a person, you'll want to use the Person Controls instead. Over to the right, you've got these two little icons. The one on the right is a person tracking. So you get your person options. The one on the left is for object tracking, which is the one we're going to use for this example. Now the first thing you want to do, use your play head to find what's called your reference frame. So you need to pick the point where your subject is really nice and clear, isn't being obstructed by anything, because this is the point where we're going to tell DaVinci Resolve the thing we wanted to track. So I'm just going to use this frame here. That will do. This is a nice, simple one. Now again, in your Magic Mask Controls, make sure you've got this little ink dropper with the plus selected. And then you just need to draw a line on your subject. You can do a little line or you can squiggle and try and select loads of it, like so, and release, and it'll pick up your subject. So just like that, it's picked up the cat like so. Now, if you don't see this overlay, there's a toggle mask overlay down here in the Magic Mask Controls. So if I was just to tick that, that would turn it off and we get no red highlighting, turn it back on, and we get our red highlight like so. Now, just to the left of that, while we're here, we've got an invert mask. So if you wanted the opposite to be selected, we could just toggle that. So now everything but our cat is selected, or we revert it back. Now our cat is selected, and everything else isn't. Now you can do as many lines as you need to. So that's done a really good job of picking up our cat, but you can actually see a little bit of the tail down here has been missed. So still with our dropper with the plus selected, we're just going to do this little line on the little tail here to get that picked up. But I actually went slightly too far and it's added some more down here. So what you can then do, you can either use the dropper with the little minus icon. So you give that a click, or what I prefer to do with the dropper with the plus, just hold the Alt key, and you'll see on your preview that the dropper will now have a little minus sign. I'm just going to do some squiggles down here. The lines will be red. And we're just telling DaVinci Resolve that I don't want those things highlighted. We'll do another one down here. And there we go. So the cat with our little tail, we don't want any of this wall, and we're good to go. Now before we start tracking, there's one last thing you've got this quality and you've got faster, and then you've got better. And it does exactly what you'd expect. Faster will give you a faster, but less accurate mask and track, whereas better will take longer, but will generally give you better results. I'm going to leave this as faster for this example. And then we just need to do our tracking. So that's where these tracking controls come in. And the main three that you're going to use, you've got this little play icon here to play forwards, you've got this little back icon to play backwards, and then you've got this left and right arrow to play forwards and backwards. So my reference frame is right here in the middle. So this is the exact point where we've selected everything. If I was to move my playhead, we would actually come off that reference frame. If you need to get back to it, you just use this little icon right here to go to the reference frame, and that will take you back to where you did your little squiggles. Now mine is right in the middle of my playhead. So I need to track forwards and backwards. So we're just going to use the little forwards and backwards icon. And the virtual resolve will do the rest. It's tracking the cat forwards of my reference frame. And once it's done that, it will then go back and track backwards of the reference frame to make sure the entire timeline is covered. And as you can see, done a pretty good job of tracking our cat like so. Now once that's done, there are some matte finesse controls down here where you can add some blur to the mask. You can clean up the black and the white. For reference, black is referring to everything that isn't selected. So in my case, the background was white is referring to the subject. So you can just use these controls to tidy up the mask as you need to. So I'm pretty happy with that. So I'm going to turn off my overlay and then I can start to do whatever I want to this mask. So I'm just going to come over to my primary wheels. And if we just move our offset, we can just change the color of our cat to get our cat whatever color we want. Let's actually get rid of the axe. We don't want to change the color of the cat. But something slightly more realistic, I'm going to bring him up with the offset lower the shadows a bit. So it's just a little bit brighter hit play. And we've just really quickly changed the exposure of our cat without changing anything else on a blue cat. I've got a blue cat job done. Now in this example, we've got a dude on a bike, which is a much more complicated mask. And I just want to show you really quickly how you use the strokes to isolate exactly what you want. So we're going to come down to our magic masks. I'm going to keep it as faster. We're going to find our reference frame. It's actually zoomed into our bike at the end. So obviously, we're not going to use this. We're going to use a point where we've got a really good shot of the bike. So I'm going to go with something like this. And I'm just going to first select a bit of the bike like so. And it's just going to select the front half like this. We then need to select the front sort of fender, the suspension, the wheels, the brakes, everything else. Same on the rear and then the back of the bike as well. So we're just going to pick up all these points like so. Now we're missing the handlebars. So we're going to grab those and something like that. So we've just done a few little strokes like so. Now it's picked up some random points in the road. So first thing's first, I'm going to hold Alt. So I'm on my Minus dropper. Get rid of those because we don't want them. Picked up some bits of his shirt. So we'll get rid of that. And it's picked up his shoes. So we're just going to get rid of those. And you just go through and you tidy up the mask, getting it looking exactly as you want it. Selected the glove. So we're going to get rid of that and try and get it roughly looking like so. So I'm pretty happy with that. So now what I'm going to do is just play backwards. And it's going to track just the things that we selected. You can see clearly here that the guy's leg hasn't been done. We can play this forwards as well. And as it zooms in, it's tracking the bike until it goes out of frame. And then we've just got our guy. So I'm just going to turn off my toggle. And again, we could come here and we could mess with our exposure. We could change the color. We could do whatever we want, increase the contrast, do any sort of grading we wanted purely on the bike rather than everything else. Now you can also apply effects. So I'm just going to open up my effects library. Let's just grab the mosaic blur so we can mosaic blur out the bike. We're going to drop that on the node. And now we've got our mosaic bike like so. But the driver is looking pretty good. Now sometimes you will need to make amendments to your mask either before or after your reference frame. So this here is my reference frame, because the car was nice and clear. But as we go backwards at the very beginning, you can see is obscured by this car here. And what actually happens if we zoom in a little bit, you can see a little bit of the mask is starting to come onto this car in front. So we just need to tidy that up. So what we're going to do, just move my player to the very point where it starts to appear on this other car. So it's right there and then right there. So anything to the left of that, we've got a mask, but right there, this car in front is perfectly clear. Now we're going to use our negative tool or I'm just going to hold alt on my keyboard and drag just to tell resolve not to touch any of this bit here, like so. Now in my magic masks, our little blue bar to the left of where my playhead is, there's now no blue bar. And that's telling us we need to just retract that section. So I'm not going to hit track forwards and back because everything after this point is absolutely fine. We just need to track this backwards. So I'm going to hit my play backwards button. That's just going to play backwards. It's going to mask our car, but it's making sure not to select any of this one. So now if we hit play, it's not coming on to this car in front at all. It's just masking our car behind perfectly. Like so easy peasy. Now you can actually use the multiple strokes to track multiple things within the same frame as well. Now this example I'm going to show you is a little bit crazy. So let's hop straight into it. So I've got this footage of this skier, and then he goes down to this helicopter down here. I'm going to do this essentially wrong. What you should do is find your reference point. So we'll find a point where they're both nicely in shot. So I'd probably go with something like this. But instead, I went with this. So we've got a little bit of their helicopter here, and we've got the guy. So first things first, let's select our dude. So we're just going to give him a little squiggle, select him like so. And then once we're going to select the helicopter, but it's only the side of it. So we're just going to come on down here, give it a real rough drawing like so, and then release. Now straight away, something interesting has happened, and it's automatically picked up this helicopter blade. I didn't draw anything over here, but it's picked it up. Only half of it though. So we just need to fill in the rest. I'm just going to tell it like so. Now I'm happy with that. Now we need to track this backwards. So we're going to start tracking and something magic is going to happen. It picks up the entire helicopter, or the blades, or the rotor, everything. And it keeps tracking it all the way up the mountain, while also still tracking the skier as well. How ridiculous is that? This thing really is magic. And I've got one last super quick example for you all. And that's how to use an alpha output to use magic masks to put titles, or whatever, behind things like this. So we've got this footage of this lady pouring some coffee here. And I just want to put something behind the mug, and the coffee, and the little flask. So let's give it a go. So the first thing I need to do, I'm going to duplicate this footage. So I'm just going to give it a click on my timeline, hold the Alt key, drag up two tracks. So we've got the footage, space, footage. Then I come down to this bottom one here, I'm going to hit D on my keyboard, just to disable it, because we don't actually need it for now. Then I'm going to grab a title, or I could grab a PNG or an image, whatever. And we're going to put this under here, like so. We'll come back to it and amend it in a moment. Then we're going to select our top footage and jump into our color page. And we're going to use our magic mask, and we're going to select our objects. So first things first, our reference frame, anything here looks pretty good. So we're just going to go, I want all of this arm and the flask. So we'll do that first. Make sure our overlays on. It's already picked up the actual drink. It's done a really good job there, actually. Then we're going to select the mug as well, and the hand. It's got the handle, but it's selected everything in the middle. So we're going to hold Alt, get rid of that, and we'll go with something like that. We're going to play this forwards and backwards to track, and let's see how it does. So that looked like it tracked pretty well indeed, and didn't take very long at all. So now what we need to do is to add our Alpha output so that we get rid of anything that isn't tracked. So first things first, I need to turn off my overlay. Then in my nose, just right click any empty space and come on down to the add Alpha output, and you'll get the little blue dot in the bottom right hand corner. Then from your node, which has got your magic mask on it, click the little blue box, drag it to the blue circle, and there we go. That will just get rid of everything that wasn't part of our magic mask, which gives us this. Now I'm not going to mess around with my finesse tools too much, but I'm just going to add a bit of a blur just to soften that edge, something like that. Then we're going to jump back into the edit page. I'm going to toggle my background back on. This one doesn't have the actual magic mask. So we're going to hit D on our keyboard just to turn this back on. So now basically our foreground is just the arm and the flask and the coffee, and then we've got our title and then we've got our background. So if I go to the title, I can make this as big as I like. Let's just call this coffee. And then if we hit play, it's not tracked or animated or anything, but you can see just how well of a job it's done at tracking this. The pour is perfectly going over the top of the coffee into the mug. Easy peasy. No time at all. Magic masks for the win. Now it was thanks to that NVIDIA 3090 GPU in my scan 3XS system, which allowed me to record this tutorial so quickly and so smoothly. So do check out Scan's lineup of NVIDIA Studio certified 3XS systems by clicking on the link down in the description below. Thanks for watching. Take it easy. I'll catch you next time.
