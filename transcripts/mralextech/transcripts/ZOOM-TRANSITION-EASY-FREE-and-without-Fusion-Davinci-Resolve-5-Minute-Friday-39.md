What up folks, I'm back with another transitions video. And in this one, I'm gonna show you how to do this zoom in and out. And very much like my last transitions video, the glitch transition, you can check out up here. This was made entirely in the edit tab using adjustment clips and without stepping foot into fusion. So without further ado, let's get to it. So the first thing you need to do is head into your effects library, click on this icon here, open up your toolbox, go down to effects, and then we're gonna use an adjustment clip. So we're gonna put that on our timeline just over the point where our two clips meet. Now you can change the length of this according to whatever you like, but I like to go with about 12 frames. So the easiest way to do that is put your playhead right in the center of the two, and then just using the arrow keys, we're gonna go left, one, two, three, four, five, six. We just cut that adjustment clip down to size, and then one, two, three, four, five, six. And adjust that down to size again, like so. Now while you've got the toolbox open, head into the open effects, and you wanna grab the zoom blur, and you wanna apply that to your adjustment clip. And again, with that open, head into your video transitions, grab a cross dissolve. You can use any, I find cross dissolve works well, and drop that onto the actual transition, like so. And then just make that nice and short. So now give your adjustment clip a click, so it's highlighted in red, and then open up the inspector by clicking on this icon in the top right hand corner. Go down to transform, and open up the transform area, like so. Now what we're gonna do is use keyframes to actually do the zoom in and the zoom out. If you don't really know what I'm talking about with keyframes, click on the video above where I talk about keyframes and what they do. So the easiest way again to do this, come right into the middle, so on this point with your playhead, and then click on this diamond here to add a keyframe in the center. So it goes red. And then in the zoom area, just select how much you want to be zoomed in. Three works really well for me. So we've got three in the center, and then drag your playhead to the very beginning of the adjustment clip, and then just double click on the word zoom, and it'll reset back to one. So the beginning of the transition, it won't be zoomed in at all, and then in the middle, it'll be zoomed in three. And then it goes to the end, and just do the same thing, double click, set that back to one. So it will zoom in and then zoom out. So if we hit play, we've got something happening. Now at the moment that zoom is linear, so it's the same speed. It works a little bit better if you ease it in and out. So you actually make it so it speeds up and then slows down. So to do that, click on the adjustment clip, and then you can either right click and go to the retime curve, or click on this little icon here, and this will pop open. Now you're looking for this sort of pyramid, this triangle. If it's not highlighted, it may just be in the background like so. You just need to give it a click so it's highlighted like that. And then you can see our three key frames. Now we're gonna leave the middle one. We're gonna come to this one on the left, give it a click so it's highlighted in red, and then give this icon here a click, the one on the left hand side, and it'll put that nice little curve in it so the zoom will start off slow and then start to speed up. Repeat the process for this one, so give it a click, but this time select this one here, and then we've got it all go slow and zoom in, and then it will change direction really quick at the top, and then come back out again. Once you're done, you can close that down, hit play on that, and that's starting to look a lot better. We just now need to adjust our zoom blur levels, and we're gonna do the same thing, we're gonna key frame that. So click the adjustment clip. In the inspector, which you should probably still have open, click on this open effects, and you've got the zoom blur. So again, pop your playhead right in the middle, and choose the amount of zoom that you want, either just a little bit or loads. I like to have a fair bit, point eight seems to work well for me. Now you'll also notice that you've got these sort of weird black edges at the minute, they don't look very nice, so just change the border type from black to reflect, and the vintage will sort of fill in the gaps for you, and that looks a lot nicer. Now again, we're gonna use key frames, so we're gonna click on the little diamond here, to add a key frame in the center, where it's at its fullest strength. We're gonna move our playhead to the beginning, and we're gonna drop that all the way down to zero, right to the end, drop that down to zero again. So again, at the beginning of the transition, there's no blur, and then as we start to zoom in, the blur starts to kick in, and then it's at full strength in the middle, and then it works its way out again, as we zoom back out. So now if we hit play on that, we've got a really nice zoom in and out with zoom blur. We can now grab a sound effect, just because you can't have a transition without a nice sound effect, and then if we hit play, there it is. And that's it folks, I hope that was useful. I apologize for my sore throats, I've got a slightly deeper voice than usual, so I hope that wasn't too off-putting. Now, if you've got any other transitions you'd like to see, pop them in the comments down below. Any other feedback as well, I'd love to hear it, so pop it down below. If you enjoyed it, thumbs up.
