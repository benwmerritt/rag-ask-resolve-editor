Tips and tricks for getting the most out of the AI generated subtitles within DaVinci Resolve Studio 20. Sponsored by scan.co.uk and Nvidia and for you guys in a rush, here's the quick version. From the edit page, click on Timeline at the very top, come down to AI Tools and then create subtitles from Audio. Customize as required, then hit Create. Your subtitles will appear on your timeline on a new Subtitle 1 track. Give that track a click, open up the Inspector, go to Caption and you can customize any of the additional captions. Go to Track and then you can format them. If you want fancy subtitles, open up the Effects Library, go to Titles, Subtitles, grab one of these and drop it on this subtitle track. From the Deliver page, scroll to the bottom, expand Subtitle Settings, tick the Export Subtitle box, Format. If you need this as a separate file for YouTube, as a separate file, if you want to burn them in, go to Burn into Video. Make sure the Export As setting is SRT without formatting if you do want these for social media. Make sure to tick the box, add to the Render Cube and job done. AI generated subtitles within DaVinci Resolve Studio 20. Yes, Studio paid version only. Now as mentioned, this video is sponsored by Nvidia and Scan.co.uk. Everything I show in this video is being run on this lovely 3XS system by Scan, which is being powered by this beastly Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti, which absolutely flies through these subtitles. Because Nvidia have gone big on AO processing for this generation of GPUs, you can check out Scan's lineup of Nvidia 50 Series graphics cards by simply clicking on the link down in the description below. Right, let's kick things off talking about those options, the customization options we skipped right past a second ago. So when you generate your subtitles, you'll see this box, Create Subtitles from Audio. The first thing to select, Language. Or you can just leave it as Auto, where it will automatically pick up the language and create the subtitles correctly for you. We've got Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese and then a couple more. If your language is missing from there, thanks to DaVinci Resolve Studio 20, you can now enable the extended language support by ticking this tick box. It will tell you you need to download the additional transcription language pack, which you can do so by clicking on Download. It'll take you to the Download Manager and download those additional languages. Once that's done, rerun that routine. And now from this language list, we've got a bunch more options. Caption preset, you can generally leave as it is unless you're doing something specifically for teletext or Netflix. Then you've got the minimum characters per line. If you want much shorter, punchier subtitles like this that are maybe a word or two, then you'll want to lower this number to something like 10, 15 around that range. If you want much longer, slower subtitles which show full sentences like these, then you may want to increase that number to 50 or 60. I'm going to leave that as 42. Then we've got lines, single or double. I generally recommend that you just leave it as single. Single just seems to work better. And if you're only doing simple formatting, you can actually amend it later on anyway. And if you want to do fancy punchy animated fusion based subtitles, that doesn't work anyway. So you might as well just leave it as single. Then we can add any gaps between the subtitles. But again, I generally leave that as zero. Then you hit Create and crack on from there. And then super quick before I forget, Subtitle one on the edit page, simply right click over here on the left. And then you can hit delete track to get rid of it. Next up, if you need to create them quicker, you can if you're using the cut page or the iPad version, this is dedicated button, or you can assign a keyboard shortcut just to make your life a little bit easier. So if you're on the cut page or on the iPad, if you click on this little icon down here to the left of your timeline, timeline actions at the very top, create subtitles from audio. It does the same thing. It's just in a different place. Or alternatively, what I've done, go to DaVinci Resolve in the very top left hand corner, come down to keyboard customization. In this search box over on the right, just type in subtitles, and it will take you to timeline, AI tools, create subtitles from audio, you get this little box over on the right hand side. This is where you can assign a keyboard shortcut. Give that a click. And I've gone for Alt or Option if you're on a Mac and S because that's not already taken. Then click Save. You may need to create a new preset. It'll ask for a name. Close that down and then from either the edit page or the cut page, you can simply hit Alt and S for subtitles and you're straight into this create subtitles window. Combine that shortcut with the honestly, ridiculously quick 5070ti means I can create subtitles even for this very video, which is nearly 20 minutes long in seconds. Now, so far, we've been looking at how to create subtitles for the entire timeline, but you can create subtitles for one particular clip or a section of clips on that timeline using the simple ins and outs. So this timeline, we've got no marking, so it will just generate the subtitles for the entire thing by default. But if we only wanted it for this particular clip here, come to the very beginning with your playhead, hit I on your keyboard, go to the end, hit O. Now if I use my keyboard shortcut, Alt and S, I can bring this box up, let's hit create. And it's just going to create the subtitles for that particular clip or any clips which are within that in and out range. If we extended that range over these couple of clips like so, let's do the same thing again, create. We've now got our subtitles across those individual clips. Now quick tip, hit Alt and X or Option and X to get rid of that in and out range so it doesn't do anything weird on your timeline. Now on a very similar note, if you are doing that, you're just running these for a particular clip because you want them on screen or whatever, you can actually link the subtitles to the clip. So if you move the clip around, the subtitles come with it. Now this doesn't work particularly well if you're trying to do kind of the entire timeline, it gets confused. This is best if you've just generated subtitles for one particular clip like I have here. We've got these subtitles for this clip here. All we need to do, I can just click and drag to do this, highlight all of those, select them all so they're all highlighted in red and then right click on the clip down here and there is an option to link clips and that will link the subtitles. So now if I move this clip around, the subtitles come with it, which is super duper handy. Okay, that's enough of all that. Let's talk about actually amending them if they make any errors and customizing them so they look a little bit fancier. So first up, let's just have a quick look at how you amend them if it's made any mistakes. All you need to do, you can either click on any of the individual subtitles or you can click on the track over here on the left. Open up the inspector, you've got all of your individual subtitles or the individual captions for each one and then you can either just click through the list or what I like to do is use this previous and next to just jump through each one, have a quick look for any typos or whatever and if it's made any, you just click in the box and you change it as required and then change in the timing is exactly as you'd expect. You click on the individual subtitles on the subtitle track and then you can move them along the timeline or change the lengths and adjust them to get the timing just right. Now we're going to start off with the simple customization, which does actually have some benefit and then we'll take a look at using the fusion generated ones, the animated ones, which look a bit fancier and I'm going to show you techniques to save both different types as your very own presets. From this same area in the inspector, go to track and then you've got all of the formatting for these subtitles. So we can change the font, they change it to overpass, we can change the size, the color, the line spacing, the kerning, the we can add a stroke, we can transform, move that position, drop shadow, background, whatever and this will affect every single subtitle on this track and here if you do want to change single to double scroll down to this subtitle settings, enable that, untick the use project settings and then reduce your max line length and then you can change the single line to double, triple, good ruble or whatever you need. Quick note, this box is super sensitive, so just be careful with it. If you go back to this caption, you can customize this individual caption, this individual subtitle. So I'm on this one here, number seven, if we go to customize caption, I can then change the font of just this caption. So everything now stays the same, except for this one. Now what's off the mist is you can do this for individual words as well. So if we go to this number one caption here, let's customize the caption, if we just highlight the word personally and then come to the font family, let's change this to something else, we can just change the font for that particular word. So it's cool if you're baking these in and you want to emphasize different words, which you can't do with the Fancy Fusion versions. Now if you want to save this simple customization, here's what you do. From the inspector, make sure you've got the subtitle options open, then click these three little dots in the top right hand corner and there is an option to save track as preset. We'll give this a name and then click okay. Now if I just delete this, we can run the routine once again. Once they've been generated, click on any of them to open up the subtitle settings, click on your three little dots, you'll see subs one or whatever you've called it. We can then load that preset in and it'll load in our settings. Next up, doing the Fusion version, the fancier, animatable subtitles and yes, you can save those as well, it's just slightly trickier. So with your standard subtitles created, I recommend you go through, make any amendments you need to to the individual captions, then open up the effects library and click on titles. If you scroll down, you can actually apply any of these standard Fusion titles to your subtitles. Now some of these work better than others, but even the animated ones will work. So if I grab something like Jitter and I drop it down here on this subtitle one track, that will apply a Jitter title to all of our subtitles. Once again, if we give one of them a click, click on track, we've got all of the options within here. So we'd need to change the size and the fonts and do whatever we wanted. But now we've got these Jitter subtitles. Now super quick note, you can't come into this text box and change the text, it will do weird things. What you need to do to change the individual captions, you jump back to captions. I could then make the change within here, go back to track and it will be reflected within this box. To get rid of this one, we simply click on that little bin icon to get rid of that. We can scroll down, we could try another one like Long Shadow, which kind of looks cool, it's a bit janky, but there you go. We can get rid of that one, or we could try something like Pow and there we go. Now if we keep scrolling down, or we expand the titles and click on subtitles, these are the dedicated subtitles. Now there are two options you've got animated, which we'll come back to in a second. And then we've got these new subtitles. Now you apply them in exactly the same way. So we've got black on white background, we give that a click, we drop it down here on subtitle one, I haven't actually deleted Pow, but if we add a new one, it will just overwrite it like so. And once again, we give it a click, go to track, we can't use the text box, we go to caption to amend it if we need to, but then we can come through and make any amendments to the sizing, the fonts, the layout, the transforms, the shading, all of this stuff within here to customize how all of these different subtitles look. The animated ones are very similar. So we've got Lollipop, Rotate, Slide In, Statement and Word Highlight. So if I grab Word Highlight, drop this on this subtitle one track, hit play, and we've got our Word for Word subtitles. Once again, to customize, you give it a click in the inspector, this will look slightly different because this is specifically for the animated ones. But we can tick right on words, we can do show the speaker, if there's multiple speakers, we can change the center, we can change the font, the color, the size, the tracking, the word spacing, we can enable the highlight fill. So when a spoken word is spoken, it goes red. If we wanted it to be a bit softer, we could soften it, add some glow, change the color, or turn that off entirely. We can enable a colored outline for the spoken word or even a colored background. So you can come in and just customize this as you like. If you want to get rid of this, you can just click on the little bin icon to revert it back to the simple customization, or we can grab another one from the effects library, drop it on our track, and we can use this one instead. Fancy customization in a nutshell. Now if you need to save these, you just need to jump into Fusion and save them like you would any other Fusion title. Now if you've never done this before, it looks complicated, it looks a bit tricky, it's not when you get used to it. It should be better, Blackmagic if you're watching, there should be a better process for this. But here's how you do it. So in the inspector, where you've got all of your customization options, click on this icon in the top right hand corner, the little magic wand, and it will take you to Fusion, and you should see this little macro tool down here. Quick note, if it's not one of the animated ones you're customizing, it's just a simple Fusion one, you'll see template rather than macro tool one, but the process is the same. Right click on this node, go to settings, and then go to save as. You want to save this in a location that's nice and easy to access. It doesn't actually matter where, just somewhere nice and easy. So I'm going to put this on my desktop, and we'll just call these fancy subs, and then click save. Now still within Fusion, open up the effects library, expand templates, expand edit, expand titles, and then click on subtitles. Open up that folder where you saved your fancy sub, so I've got my desktop folder here outside of the Venture Resolve, I've just opened it up in Windows, and then grab your fancy subs and drop it onto this subtitles folder. You should then see it will update with your fancy subs. So now we have that saved. Now if I jump back over to the edit page, open up the effects library, go to the same place, titles, subtitles, you should now see your new preset saved within there. If you don't see the preset, simply close the Venture Resolve completely, reopen it back up, and it should appear. Then you just treat them like any other preset, grab them, drop them on that subtitle track, and your fancy subs or whatever you've called them will load straight in. Right, to finish, just a couple more things. First up, exporting your subtitles. As mentioned in the very quick intro, from the deliver page, scroll right down to the bottom, you've got your subtitle settings, you tick your box, you select your format, either as a separate file, as embedded captions, or you can burn them into the video. If you need to provide a separate file like you do on YouTube, then obviously you select as a separate file. If you want the subtitles to actually be baked into the video, so they are part of the video file, therefore cannot be turned off, which is something you might do for Instagram, TikTok, those sort of really punchy social media videos, then you simply select burn into video. If you select burn into video, there are no other options. So then you just render out your video. As a separate file, you then select export as for YouTube, you want SRT without formatting, then you make sure you tick your box and you add to the render queue. Once it's rendered, you'll have your video file and then you'll have your separate subtitles SRT file, but you don't have to export the video every single time if you need the subtitles. So to export them from the edit page, you simply right click on the subtitle one track over here on the left hand side. There is an option to export subtitle, choose the location, give it a name, make sure to change the type from subtitles SRT to SRT without formatting. Again, if you're going on YouTube, then you simply hit save and they'll export all of those ready to go. Now if you're burning in your subtitles, here's a neat trick to combine different styles on the one subtitle track. Now on this subtitle one track, find an empty space. So I'm going to go over here, right click, and we're going to add a subtitle region. That'll give you this mini sort of additional track on your subtitle one track. Now I recommend you zoom in and make this nice and big. Otherwise, it will try and make an additional subtitle track and it can be very annoying to grab a handful of your subtitles and just drag up onto this mini new additional region. Now this second region can be formatted completely differently. So let's change this one to magneto, make this a bit bigger. Now all the subtitles on this additional region will have this font and everything on the original will have the original. Now you can also use the fusion subtitles either the standard ones or the animated ones, but they will only apply to this lower region. So if I grab word highlight, drop this on this subtitle one track. Anything on this original region down here will have the word for word fusion animation. Anything on this upper region will just have the standard formatting which we can amend within this track area. So you can't actually combine multiple different fusion types on this one subtitle track. If you want to do another one, you can still right click, add a subtitle region to add a third region, which we can then drag up to to do a third style as well. When you burn these in, it will combine all of the different regions. And lastly, if you need both an SRT and you want to burn them in, there's a few ways to do this. You could create your SRT subtitles first of all, then go to your subtitle one track, export them, then simply wipe this track and then start again. All what you can do is if you right click over here on this empty space above subtitle one, you can add a new subtitle track which will give you subtitle two, it'll be disabled by default. So click this icon to enable it, which will disable your subtitle one. If you're burn in subtitles are exactly the same as your SRT, you can just select them, hold alt or option drag up to make a copy on subtitle two. And then you can customize these however you like. And then when you go to the deliver page, because subtitle one is disabled, when you go to your subtitle track and do burn in, it will only be those on subtitle two, which will appear. Alternatively, if you want your burnt in subtitles to be different, you want them to be punchier, for example, we can do the same thing we did before, mark out in and out points or run our subtitles routine. But now we're going to make these nice and short and punchy. Click create. That's going to create a burn in on subtitle two with a completely different format. Then we can go to our effects library titles, subtitles, grab our fancy subs we made earlier, drop that onto subtitle two. And there you go. And that is everything I think you need to know about using these AI generated subtitles within DaVinci Resolve Studio 20. Thank you ever so much for watching subtitles at yeah. See you next time.
