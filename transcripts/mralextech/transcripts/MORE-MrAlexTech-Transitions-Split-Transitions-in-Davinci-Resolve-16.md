What up folks, it's Alex here. Now in my previous video, I showed you how to make some really simple but surprisingly effective camera movement style transitions. So you do need to watch that video before you watch this one, so it's linked up here. Go give that a click and give that one a watch and then come back. Right, now in this video, what we're gonna do is show you how to take those transitions and just tweak them a little bit, take them to the next level and make some transitions that look more like this. disappointments which I think look really, really cool. So we're gonna cover that in this video. Now, if you don't want to actually make these transitions yourself, I have made a pack available. It's available in 24, 30 and 60 frames per second. It's £3. It's the price of one coffee on my Buy Me A Coffee page. It's all linked down below. They are adjustment clips so they're really easy to use but that means there's no audio. You'll have to go and source some audio for the transitions yourself. And before you download, you do need to be on DaVinci Resolve 16.1.2 or newer because that's the version I used to make the transitions. In this video, I'm going to show you the general concept of how to make them. I'm not going to show you how to make every one of the transitions so you may still want to have a look at the pack anyway but we're going to cover the basics. I do generally recommend that you watch the video before you do anything because it's much better to get an understanding of how these work so then you can tweak them, maybe create some more yourself and just generally have a better knowledge of how they work. Right, with all that out of the way, let's blow it up in DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you how. So here we are in DaVinci Resolve and we're pretty much carrying on from exactly the point we left off in the last video so make sure you watch that one before this one. Now the same as before, make sure to check your project settings because it's going to be locked into these transitions and you won't be able to change it easily so make sure you set your timeline frame rate correctly before you do anything else. I'm going to be using 24 frames per second. Now as you can see, I've got the same clip on my timeline and in my media poll over here, I've got some of the transitions we made last time and we're actually going to use those as the base to start these ones so we don't have as much work to do. It makes life much easier. So I'm going to come over here and grab my whip left transition and just pop that on my timeline. If you didn't follow my previous tutorial but you want to have a go at creating these, what you can do is download my previous transitions pack, the link is down below if you want to grab it. Grab a whip transition and just grab a whip left or whip right from there and add it onto the timeline. We're going to shoot into fusion and then just make sure that you click on clips and select the adjustment clip. So you've got that one selected. You should see these nodes here. Then we can get rid of the clips and then the only things you'll need open are the effects library, the nodes and then from the right the inspector. And we're going to have a look at our nodes now. Now quick tip for you, if as you can see here I'm missing my media in, just use the middle mouse button click and hold and you can drag this area around and we can just move things around as needs be. Now if we hit play, we've got a real simple whip left transition and what we want to do is to make it so half the screen goes left or the other half goes right. We just need to copy a few bits and add a mask. So what we're going to do, click and hold your mouse and just drag over the transform and the directional blur nodes and then we're just going to hit control C on our keyboard to make a copy. Give anywhere we click to deselect those so nothing selected and then just hit control V to paste. And then we're just going to head over to our media in here, click on this little white square, hold your mouse and then you can drag up to the transform node. So we're linking the media into this new transform node. Again using the train track analogy, this is the station we've got two train lines, one's coming down here going to our media in, we're just setting up a new line which goes up here and does basically the same thing. So what I like to do here now is I'm just going to disconnect this one. So you can just do the easiest way, give it a click anywhere so it's loose like that and then just release your mouse and it'll get rid of it and then just drag this one here instead. So now we're looking at this line rather than this line so we can actually see what we're doing. So if we hit play we've still got a whip left. We want to just reverse this to be a whip right. So give the transform node a click, open up the inspector and then you've got transform center and you've got your key frames here. You're just going to go to the very beginning one like so. You should only have three. So the first one 0.5 that's centered so that's exactly as it is we can leave that be. So we'll go to the next one. Now as I mentioned in the previous video you always want to either subtract or plus one. So we went from 0.5 to minus 0.5 to whip left so we just need to change that from a minus 0.5 to 1.5 and we can leave everything else as it is. We'll go to the next one that's a minus 1.5 because it went from 0.5 minus 0.5 to minus 1.5. We've gone from 0.5 to 1.5 so this becomes 2.5. Now if we hit play we've got a whip transition going right. All the key frames, all the spliting is exactly the same, the animation looks pretty much identical it's just going the other way which is perfect. So now we need to merge these two things together. We've got our whip right here and we've got our whip left here. Now I'm lazy often I leave these as they are if you want to and I actually would recommend it. Right click on the node, go to rename and call this one say whip right and this one whip left. Just makes life a little easier so you can see what you're doing. So now we've got these two things, one's ripping to the right, one's ripping to the left and we need to bring them together. And we do that using what's called a merge node. Now you can use this little toolbar here and it's this icon, it's called merge or head into your effects library, open up the tools, go down to composite and you've got merge and we're just going to click and hold and drag that into our nodes here. Now what we want to do is just connect the directional blur, both the directional blur is to our merge and then connect our merge to our media out. So I'm just going to click here, disconnect this one and connect it to our merge node instead like so. And we're going to connect the directional blur here to our merge node as well and then we're going to connect our merge node to our media out. Now if we hit play you can see we're still only seeing one of these paths. So we've got our whip right going on at the moment and what it's actually doing is just stacking them both because they're both the same size, they're both identical, you're only seeing the top layer essentially. We can switch those by going to the merge one, right click and selecting swap inputs. So you can see it's going to the right now, if I select that, it's now going to the left and it'll just swap the inputs around. So that's nearly there, we're nearly done. What we want to do is mask off half of one so that everything within the mask goes right and everything else goes left. Then to do that we're just going to use a mask, they appear on this toolbar here so we've got this rectangle or again effects library, tools, mask and then you can grab any of these from here. So I'm just going to grab the rectangle and I'm going to pop it here and then we just connect the rectangle to our merge and straight away what you'll see is that will effectively act like a window. So everything within the rectangle is going left and everything outside of the rectangle is going to the right. Now we're nearly done. So if we click on the rectangle, we're going to open up the inspector and we're just going to put it where we want it. So I want half of this going to the right and half going to the left split right down the middle. So we can just move this down a little bit, you can actually just type in 0.25 to get in the right place. And the width is only 0.5 at the minute, we change that to 1. So we've got the bottom whipping left and the top whipping right and they're all coming together at the end. Now if you want to actually reverse these, there's a few ways to do it. If we head to the merge one, we can right click and we can swap the inputs and it will swap those round or an easier way I find, go to the rectangle one and you've actually got this invert tool here, give that a click and it will do the same thing. So we've got a top right bottom left or a top left bottom right. So now once we're happy, if we head to edit, give it a click on our timeline heading to the inspector, we've got width left, I'm going to call this split top left, something along those lines and then I can pop that either into a power bin so it's available from any project or just into my media pool so it's available for this project. Then we can just add that anywhere we like, hit play and there we go. Now we're just going to head back into fusion and we're going to show you some variations that are all built along this exact same principle. So we're going to head into fusion, clips, select our adjustment clip and here we go. So if we click on the rectangle, it's just along the bottom at the moment so I'm just going to reset everything by clicking on this icon here in the inspector, make it square back in the middle. Now we're going to change the height to be, let's just go with 0.4, we're going to keep it right in the center and we change the width to be 1 and now we've got this transition where it looks like there's three things going on. So we've got top and bottom going left, just the middle going right and again if we click on the rectangle and we invert that, we can swap that so everything in the middle goes left and everything else goes to the right. So let's head back into the edit tab, I'm going to remove this one and instead I'm going to get a spin clockwise. Again we made these in the last video, simple spin like so and we're just going to repeat the process. So we're going to head into fusion, do a copy, do a paste or link that up there like so. We're just going to get rid of that and do that so you can see what we're doing. I want to do the same thing, we're going to reverse this rotation so give the transformer click, open up the inspector, go to our angle and we can see our keyframes, we've got our first one, second and third. We did minus 180 and minus 360 so we're just going to get rid of the minus to make it 180 and 360 and now we've got a rotation in a different direction. Same thing, we're going to grab a merge node, put that there, we'll link that one to that one and then pop that down there. So now that's a rotation left, let's grab our rainbow blur from here and pop that into the merge. Now we've got a rotation right, we can swap those over if we want to, give that a click and hop between them. We want to do a very similar thing, we want to mask off half, we're going to grab a ellipse at this time rather than a rectangle mask, pop that down here, we're going to drag that up, pop it into our merge. Now everything within the circle will go one way and everything else will go a different way. So now I've got a really cool spin transition with this circle. Now if we give that a click, we can change the size of it, we can soften the edges if we want to so it's got a bit more of a blurred look. We can also move it so we can put it over here if we want to make it really big. Do whatever you want, have a play with it. Once you're done, go back into the edit tab, save it as a new transition and off you go. And that's it, relatively straightforward. If you still want to buy the pack, as I say you can do, links are in the description below but hopefully these videos have given you enough information so that you can go and create your own transitions and don't need to spend a penny.
