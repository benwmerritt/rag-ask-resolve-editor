This is the world's first 16 inch 4K OLED display and it's on a laptop and laptops are awesome especially for creators. A decent laptop can make sure you make the absolute most of any free time you have during the day to get stuff done. Laptops like this. This is the Azus VivoBook Pro 16x OLED. It's a 16 inch Nvidia Studio certified Windows laptop designed for creators like you and me. How so exactly? Well for one it's more powerful than your average notebook and giving you enough grunt to get you through those tough edits. All while being not quite as thick, heavy or aggressive as those full-on dedicated gaming laptops. It has this huge 16 inch color accurate 16x10 4K OLED display which is great for photo video editing, whether you're sitting at home on the sofa or smashing down a coffee at your local coffee shop. As an Nvidia Studio laptop it's packing a dedicated laptop GPU either in the form of the RTX 3050 or RTX 3050 Ti depending on which model you go for. Plus there's some neat touches like a slick thin design, a full-size backlit illuminated keyboard, a huge trackpad with Azus' own nifty little unique built-in dial pad, a giant 96Wh battery to get you through an entire day and a decent selection of ports so you can leave most of the dongles at home. Big thanks to Azus for supporting me, MrAlexTech, by sponsoring this video. But as this is a sponsored video this will be much more of a product showcase rather than a full-on review. So let's talk specs. The backbone of this laptop is that dedicated Nvidia RTX laptop GPU, the RTX 3050 or 3050 Ti. If you fancy the RTX 3050 model you can get that combined with an Intel Core i5-11300H, an Intel Core i7-11370H or an AMD Ryzen 5600H. If you fancy the extra oomph of that RTX 3050 Ti that's available with an AMD Ryzen 5800H or the top end Ryzen 9 5900HX. In terms of RAM and storage they can be specced with up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM and up to 1TB of NVMe SSD storage. This model I have right here is a top spec model. It's rocking that Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti, AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, 32GB of RAM and that 1TB NVMe SSD. But while that's all well and good it's actually this display which is the real star of the show. Now we all know the display can make or break a laptop device and that's especially true if you're trying to edit content. Fortunately that's not the case here because on the 16X OLED we of course find this big glossy 16 inch OLED display. It's not a touchscreen but it is a proper OLED display on a laptop. Having a 16 inch display gives you an almost desktop level experience. Now that obviously comes with the trade-off of some portability but there is a VivoBook Pro 14X OLED instead that also comes with an OLED display but it's just 14 inches so it's a little bit more portable. But why is an OLED such a big deal? Well OLED displays come with a handful of benefits over a standard LCD LED display. The first being that each pixel can be completely turned off rather than just dimmed which means the blacks are properly black. As that switched off they're not emitting any light at all and it's that that gives you crazy levels of contrast 1 million to 1 and dynamic range which means it's great for both consuming and creating content. The aspect ratio is a little that comes in at 16 by 10 rather than the more standard 16 by 9. It has a 60 hertz refresh rate and boasts a higher than standard 4k resolution of 3840 by 2400 which means you get a display which is as crisp and as sharp as a standard 4k display but you get about 10 percent additional vertical space. Open up your video editor of choice, might of course be eventually resolved and you get just that little bit more headroom. You can make your timeline just that little bit bigger making it easier to make those fine adjustments or you can make your preview window bigger so you can see exactly what you're doing. In adobe lightroom or photoshop you've just got that little bit more real estate for all of your preview windows and you don't need to scroll quite so far down to get access to all of your options in the toolbars on either side of the screen. It's accurate too reaching 100% of the DCI p3 color gamut covering 133% of the sRGB range and it's pan tone validated meaning you can be confident you'll get accurate colors straight out of the box plus being an OLED panel it can actually maintain that color accuracy all throughout its brightness range all 550 nits of it which is plenty bright enough whether you're editing at home down the pub or even out and about and it does all of that without burning your retinas out thanks to 70% less blue light when compared to your usual laptop. Now that also means I can continue editing late into the night and still get a good night's sleep because my high balls aren't on fire when I eventually do clock off for the night. Now if we take a quick look around the actual display you'll notice that the bezels are pretty small giving you an 86% screen to body ratio with the top bezel hiding a tiny 720p webcam with an integrated webcam shield. It is a little bit on the larger side coming in at 36cm by 25cm but it hides its heft relatively well it's less than 2cm thick at its thickest and weighs in at just a smidge under 2kg. Now while it probably won't fit into your favorite laptop sleeve or sling it should fit into most laptop bags or backpacks so you still can take it around with you to edit on the go. The design is actually quite understated with just a few bits of flare added here and there just to jazz things up a bit. The Ryzen models come in either 0 degrees black which is the model I have right here or Meteor white while the Intel models come in either Comet Gray or Cool Silver. The Comet Gray and Meteor white models have an aluminium weave coating which gives it a grippy almost matte look to it while the Zero degrees black and Cool Silver have a more standard glossy finish. All of the models have a chassis made of aluminium which does ensure that it feels premium and robust. Now this Zero degrees black is properly black even this emblem of the front is black with black writing so make sure you don't put this thing down in the dark anywhere because you might never find it again. Open it up and you'll find a full-size backlit illuminated chiclet style keyboard with three levels of brightness. It's nice to type on with its 1.35mm of travel, solid feedback and only a small amount of chassis flex. All the main keys are black with the control keys being a dark gray with the enter key having a few little white dashes just to spice things up a bit and then the escape key is a nice bright orange. The power button in the top right hand corner doubles off as a fingerprint reader. With the laptop completely turned off give the power button one single click and it'll boot up and log you into Windows in under 10 seconds in my experience so you can get working again in no time which is super useful if you're trying to open it up do a quick bit of editing in the 20 minutes that you've got in between meetings or on your lunch break. Underneath that of course you'll find this big slab of a trackpad. It's nice to see big useful trackpads making their way onto Windows laptops. It supports multi-touch and all the usual gestures you'd expect which is not just great for navigating windows and web browsing and all that sort of casual stuff it's also really handy when you're editing videos. You can use two fingers to swipe left or right to scrub back and forth on your timeline or use vertical swipes to zoom in and out which all helps just to make editing a little bit faster and easier meaning I don't need to carry a mouse with me when I go out and about but that's not all this big trackpad is hiding. Give the icon a click slide it diagonally down and you'll activate the integrated ASUS dial pad. This I think is actually really cool. Give it a click when in Windows the on-screen dial will appear and give you access to brightness and volume by default but this can actually be customized in the Pro Art Creator Hub to add other additional Windows controls the most useful I found being the vertical scroll. It's content aware too and can be customized when using other specific software. At the moment there's only support for Adobe Creative Apps specifically Lightroom Classic, Photoshop, Premiere Pro and After Effects but they are working with other developers to bring support to other applications. In Photoshop which is what I use to create my thumbnails you can set it to do common tasks like changing brush size, hardness, layer opacity, font size and more. In Lightroom Classic which is what I personally use for all of my photography work is actually even more useful as you can zoom in and out of your photos as well as control important settings like exposure, contrast, color temperature and more. And while there isn't yet direct support for DaVinci Resolve it is still surprisingly useful. Set the dial to vertical scroll and combined with a few shortcut keys you can use it to scroll the timeline up and down, zoom in and out of either the preview or the timeline itself and even scrub through your timeline. Once you're done another quick flick of the finger it's gone and that trackpad is all yours once again. Now in terms of ports there's a decent selection. On the right hand side we have one USB 3 type A port, one USB 3 type C port both of which are plenty fast enough to enable you to edit photos or videos directly off an external SSD. Continuing on that right side we've got a full-size HDMI 1.4 port, a 3.5 millimeter combo audio jack for headphones and microphone and a micro SD card reader. On the left hand side we then have two additional USB 2.0 type A ports for connecting any additional peripherals you might use like graphics tablets or speed editors which should be enough to leave most of your dongles at home with the exception of a full-size SD card reader which in my opinion is a bit of a shame. So what about performance? Well the Nvidia laptop graphics cards both the RTX 3050 and the 3050 Ti are the lower powered 35 watt variety with 50 watt dynamic boosts and 4 gigabytes of DDR6 video RAM and while those laptop GPUs might not be quite as powerful as some of them or power hungry siblings they should be enough to get you going and get you through most of your video editing and now the reason these laptops can stay as thin and as light as they are. As these are Nvidia Studio laptops with RTX laptop GPUs it means that creative apps can use hardware acceleration to run, edit and export much faster than a traditional ultrabook plus with Nvidia's tensor cores built in they can make light work of AI based tasks like object removal, face tracking and magic masks in video editors like DaVinci Resolve. Nowadays I generally edit with 4k 10-bit video files and this top spec RTX 3050 Ti model can handle those no problem at all without the need for practices or optimized media that's both plugged in and surprisingly even when running on battery although of course it does run a little bit slower. Knock that 4k timeline down to half res and it will have no problem playing footage with five frames of temporal noise reduction in real time. Even the entry level RTX 3050 with the Ryzen 5600h should be able to handle a decent amount of video editing tasks especially if you're using the more common 8-bit video files with lower resolutions for something like social media. But of course it's not all work and no play as while these aren't designed for gaming with those dedicated laptop GPUs they are capable of some light gaming and that 16 inch OLED display makes everything look very nice indeed. Connect a controller via bluetooth and chill back with some Forza Horizon 5 running the resolution of 2560x1600 using the high preset with the resolution scaling set to ultra quality the benchmark will return an average of 61 fps with a minimum of 54 but when actually just cruising around mexico you'll get a completely locked 60 fps or if you've had something a little bit more intense open up my personal favorite doom eternal with the medium presets running at the exact same resolution of 2560x1600 and you'll get a rock solid 60 plus fps not too shabby. All of that is powered by a monster 96 watt hour battery that should give you plenty of juice to keep working all throughout the day and probably long into the night as well. So it's a reasonably thin and light laptop with a giant 16 inch OLED display and a monster battery to boot. So what do you think of this the azuz viva book pro 16x OLED?
