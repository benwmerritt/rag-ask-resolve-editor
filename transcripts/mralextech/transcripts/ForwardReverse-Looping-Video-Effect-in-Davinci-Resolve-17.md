## Transcript
Ah, what a fact Alex here, welcome to this super quick two minute Tuesday DaVinci Resolve tutorial. And in this one I'm going to show you how to create that back and forth infinite loop style effect. Super quick, super easy, might be useful for you YouTubers out there. Now if you're new here don't forget to subscribe because in my next DaVinci Resolve tutorial I'm going to be showing you how to make these cinemagraphs. They're basically images with these infinite loop moving parts that look really cool for your social media, Instagram and that sort of thing. So enough of that, let me open up DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you how to do this infinite loop. Boom, so here we are in DaVinci Resolve and we're currently on the edit tab. I've got my footage just up on my timeline and as you can see I'm literally just using a second of this footage like so. Now one thing I have tried to do, make sure the beginning, if you look at my hands, roughly matches the end. So I've just tweaked it, I've just trimmed it so that they are roughly in the same place to make this effect look a little bit better. And now we just need to make a duplicate of this clip and the easiest way to do that, give it a click so it's highlighted on the timeline like so, then hold down the Alt key on your keyboard and click and drag and you can make a duplicate like so. Let go of the mouse and job done. Then we're going to give this second one a click. We're going to open up the inspector in the top right hand corner. We're going to come down to where it says speed change, just expand that if it's minimized and then in this top one you've got direction, it's currently playing forwards, change that to backwards and that's going to reverse this clip. And now if we hit play, this section will play forward and then that section will play backwards but because we've reversed it, it's a perfect cut. What we can then do is highlight both of these, again hold the Alt key on a keyboard, just drag to make another duplicate so now we've got four. If we keep doing that as many times as we like and job done. Now if you want to make it look just a little bit more realistic, open up the effects library, come down to the toolbox effects and then grab an adjustment clip and put it above everything on your timeline like so, so mine's on video track number two. And then still within the effects library, go to open effects, scroll down until you get to the resolve effects transform area, grab a camera shake and just apply that to your adjustment clip. If we then hit play, it looks something like this. Now that's a bit strong at the moment so we want to turn that down, give the adjustment clip a click, open up the inspector once again but this time we're going to the effects tab at the top and then within this camera shake area, just click to expand that if you need to, just reduce the motion scale and the speed scale to get it looking as you want it. I'm going to increase the motion just a little bit and there we go. Now we've got a little bit of faked camera shake to go along with it which just helps to hide that loop a little bit more and there you go, job done. And that's it for this one. Hope you enjoyed this video. If you did, thumbs up, comment down below if you're new here. Don't forget to subscribe. Thanks for watching. Take it easy. I'll see you next time. Bye. Bye.
