DaVinci Resolve 20.1 is here. It's available to download and install right now. It's actually been available for about a week and I'm a bit late. But never mind, I'm gonna show you what's new. Now to get hold of this update, either jump directly to the Blackmagic support website and you can download it from there or simply open up your version of DaVinci Resolve that you've got installed, click on DaVinci Resolve, check for updates and then you can download it and install it. So what exactly is new? Let's jump in and I'll show you. I'll highlight anything that's studio only with a studio only little label so you'll know it's not included within the free version. Now let's kick things off with something that is in all versions and that is the new SearchFX keyboard shortcut. So there's a brand new keyboard shortcut which you can use on the edit page and the cut page which allows you to search the effects library and insert all of the stuff from the effects library without actually opening up the effects library. It's super neat, I like this one, it's gonna save you a bunch of time. So here we are on the edit page and all I'm gonna do is give this clip a click, hit Shift and Space, I get this new window appear and if I search for something like my magic zoom, give that a click, that's an effect. So that's just gonna drop directly on that clip like so. If we just undo that a moment, Shift, Space, let's search for an adjustment clip, give that a click and that's gonna be placed on top. It's gonna be exactly 10 seconds long, that's because that's what I've got my settings set as within the preferences, user, editing, you've got this standard generator duration, you can change that if you need to change the length of the generators or the adjustment clips that drop onto your timeline. Now this works for audio effects, so if I give this audio a click, same thing, let's just search for something like Vocal Channel, drop that on there, that's gonna appear on that audio. It also works for transitions. So if I make a little cut here, I don't need my playhead on it, I just need to be near it, Shift, Space, we'll search for the smooth cut, give that a click and it's just gonna drop that transition on the nearest edit point. Now as you may have noticed, there is a history, so all of the things that you've searched for will appear here, so that's super handy to get hold of. Oh, and that also works on the color page. I said it was only edit and cut, I lied, it also works on color, handy. Now one thing which did catch me out is I use a custom keyboard layout, I've got my own one saved, and when I first opened DaVinci Resolve 20.1, this wasn't working. I think I'd already set something to be Shift and Space, so just in case you need to know, if yours isn't working, click on DaVinci Resolve, go to keyboard customization. If we do the search within here, it's literally called search effects. You can see it under the edit category, mine Shift and Space, mine was blank or it was something else, I can't remember. If we just give that box a click, Shift and Space, save that and then it will work. Next up, rulers and guides. This is something people have wanted for a long time. You can now set up your own custom guides within the preview window and the snapping, but you can bypass the snapping if you want to. So all you need to do in your preview window, you click on this little dropdown, which is all of your overlays and whatever else. There's some new ones at the bottom. We've got rulers and guides, so if we turn those both on, you see we get these rulers around the outsides of our preview. If we click on that ruler, we get a guide, so we can move these down. If we click over here and then drag, we can get another one just like so and you can do as many of these as you like. You can set up rule of thirds, you can set up safe zones, you can do all of those handy dandy little things. If you right click on one of the guides, you can edit it so you can be a bit more precise by entering the number in and you can delete it so we can remove the guide. Now, if I select this clip, we're gonna turn on our overlay, a transform overlay, and as we drag, it will snap. And as we snap to those grids, they will highlight in purple, which is super handy. If you don't want the snapping just temporarily, just hold Alt or Option and you can bypass it so you can drag it wherever you like and it won't snap in place. You want to get rid of those, you just toggle it off and job done. Mouse pointer, mouse to C, whatever you want to call it. There's a new handy shortcut so that your playhead will automatically go to wherever your mouse pointer is. So my playhead's over there, but I want it to be over here. Rather than just clicking the mouse, I can hit C on my keyboard and the playhead will jump to wherever my mouse was. C, C, C, C, C. Now this is also called, because if you hold C, it will just follow wherever your mouse pointer is, which I think is similar to how Final Cut works. So you've got this kind of magnetic pointer playhead thing. You can just put this wherever you like, you can click something and then we can drag it around and then move over here and it's always just going to follow wherever your cursor is. It's pretty neat. If you want to customize that, once again, go into the keyboard customizations, then click on C, that will show you mouse pointer, you can give that a click and you can see it down here. So you can change the shortcut or add an additional one if you want to. Sub clips on the timeline. So sub clips are really handy. Sub clips allow you to kind of create a section of a clip as a brand new clip. So usually this works on source, but now you can do them on the timeline and it will create a sub clip timeline. Now the easiest way to show you the benefit of this, well, it's just to show you. So let me do that, I'll show you. So let's mark in and out points with I's and O's and then we can right click on the bar at the top. There is an option to create a sub clip, or we've got the keyboard shortcuts of alt and B and it will create a new sub clip within our current bin. Now let me show you the actual benefit of that. Let's create a new bin so we can keep track of what we're doing. Let's say that this section here, I want to just mess around with, but I may want to revert back to the previous version if I want to. Or let's say that I'm really happy with this section and I may want to use it in a different timeline or a different location on the timeline, whatever it may be. So I'm just going to mark my ins and outs. I'm going to do alt and B, which has created this in the media pool. Now I can mess around with this, we can delete things, do whatever we like, yada yada yada. Let's mess around with it, we go for a different thing. I'm not entirely happy with it, so I can just delete all of that. Grab this back out of here, right click, decompose and now we're back to where we left off. Sticking with small but handy changes, there's now a consistent way to import only the audio or video from your source material. So if you're chopping something together and you only want to keep grabbing the video, you don't need the audio, you can do that consistently with this new dropdown rather than remembering to click in the right place or use the keyboard shortcuts. So I'm happy with this timeline, I don't want to mess up the audio, but I do want to drop in some new B-roll. So if I open up any of my source clips, there's this new little dropdown right here and I have the options to insert video and audio, which is default, insert video only or insert audio only. So if we insert video only, that will stay consistent. So then I can grab this clip and it's only going to import the video or this one or any of these, these all have audio attached, but we're only bringing in the video. If you want to do the opposite, we open one up, change it to insert audio only. Now if I grab this, it's only going to bring in the audio. So you can just set that accordingly. It is important to remember to come back in and just toggle it back if you want to get both. Because sometimes you just need your audio, which leads me nicely to this video's sponsor, Audio. Audio.com has a massive selection of music and sound effects which you can download and use in pretty much any project. The Audio Pro license gives you access to their entire music and sound effects catalogs plus access to some of their really smart AI features like my favorite, Hands AI. Simply describe the scene that you're working on or the music that you like. Hands AI will search the entire music catalog to find you the perfect tracks.

Nice. Right, DaVinci Resolve 20.1, what's next? Improvements to the Keyframe and Curves Editor. This is the new Curves Editor, which appears on both the Edit and Cut pages. They introduced in DaVinci Resolve 20. Now, I'm actually a big fan of this new editor. I really like it. Some people seem less enthusiastic about it, but they have made it better with various little improvements. We've got improved behavior, more consistent easing, improved Curved Editor for Active Curves, ease locked parameters, as well as a few others. So I'm just going to show you what I'm most pleased with. One, Curves within the Keyframe tray, the keyboard shortcuts switch between them, and better easing. Now, the first thing is this Keyframe tray on the timeline. So you click this Show Keyframe tray and it brings up all of your keyframes across the bottom. We now have the option to also have a look at the curves instead, which is super handy. Now, you switch between the two using these two little icons, but if you open up the keyboard customization, and we just search for toggle keyframe curve. So you can actually set a keyboard shortcut. I've set mine to Shift and C. So then from the Edit page, I can do Shift and C to jump between the keyframes and the curves. Now, let me just show you in practice how I actually use this. So I use this for my vertical videos. At this point, we'll add some keyframes, and then I need to move over a bit. So we'll do that on the preview like that. And then we play forward a bit more, and now we need to move to show something else. So then we'll just hit Keyframe, play forward a bit. We'll do this on the preview, move this over. And as you can see, as we're doing that, it's adding our keyframes and our curves across the bottom. Now, I do that really quickly, and then we get all these different keyframes. Now, what we can do is highlight them all, right click, you get the curves, editors. We just go to ease in and out, which didn't work before. It always got confused as to where the curve should be, and you ended up with curves in the middle, and it didn't really work. You had to do them individually. Now, I can do that really quickly. And now we've got nice curved keyframes that look like that. From here, we can come along, grab these, move them around if we want to, just adjust the timing for individual keyframes and curves, mess with the curves like this, or we can jump into the full curves editor up here, which we're accessed by clicking on keyframes, pop that out, put that on a separate window if we want to, while still having the curves down the bottom, jump between the two. It's just nice and handy and fast, and yeah, I like it. Right, this one's a deany one, but if you work online, you're always grabbing images and whatever else, you're gonna really like this one. There's now support for WebP images. So, I remember this was a big thing with GIFs, people wanted GIFs, then you could do GIFs, and then WebP's kind of came about, and it was really annoying to download an image and find out it's a WebP, and you wanted a JPEG or a PNG. It's now not a problem, mostly. So, I've imported this WebP image, you import it in exactly the same way as anything else. If I grab it and drop it on my timeline, it will come onto my timeline. Now, there's a bit of a bug, I think, at the moment, because they always come in onto your timeline as one single frame, which is not particularly handy. What you can do is just highlight it, control and D to bring up the duration, we'll go 15 seconds and change, and now it's actually usable. An alternative way to get this to work a bit better, grab your WebP, drag onto your preview, you get this little window appear, if we do place on top, it will place on top, and it won't be one frame long, it will actually come in properly. So, we don't know why it's only one frame, but that's a little workaround. Or, another alternative, use your keyboard shortcuts, so if I highlight it and then hit F12, it will appear properly. For some reason, just dragging it, it comes in teeny tiny, don't know why, there you go. Images automatically update. This one, again, is pretty handy if, like me, you do a lot of online content, because you may be creating some images in Photoshop or Affinity or whatever, then if you save it, you want that saved to be replicated within Resolve. Now, it works, and this also works really well when combined with our automatic synced folders, which they introduced in DaVinci Resolve 20. So, I've got this bin set up here, I've got my thumbnails, I imported this folder directly from this Thumbnails folder on my PC, and I have right clicked and set up the automatic Resync media files. So, anytime I add new files to that folder, they will appear within this bin. That was in 20, but it's just super handy. Now, I've got this image here, this is one of my thumbnails. I've got this open in Photoshop. If we just move things around, yes, I'm using Photoshop on this PC, not Infinity, at the moment, and then we're just going to export this image and overwrite the existing one. If we jump back into DaVinci Resolve, just give it a sec, there you go. That image has now updated. So, previously, it would have kind of cached that, you'd have had to get rid of it and do the whole thing again. Now, it will automatically update directly on the timeline. Next up, downscale to timeline resolution. This one to me isn't that interesting on its own, but it has interesting implications, which I'll come back to in a second. But it will be useful if you're running on slightly older hardware, which can sometimes struggle, especially in Fusion. So, currently, this is a 1080p timeline, but if I open this footage up, we're going to right click, open in the Fusion page. This is going to be the actual media source resolution. This is going to come in at 4K, because that's what the video is, even though we're on a 1080p timeline. If we open up the project settings, the little cog or gear in the bottom right-hand corner, we go to Fusion, there is an option to downscale to timeline resolution for timeline clip compositions. If we tick that and then save, do exactly the same thing, right click, open in the Fusion page, this is now going to be 1080p. So, it's automatically downscaling our media so that it matches our timeline resolution, which means everything within this Fusion composition will run that little bit smoother, because it's got less work to do. Again, it's useful, but it's not all that useful for me personally, but some people will really benefit from it. The main thing for me is they are looking at that stuff. One of the big issues I have with Magic Zoom, for example, which works in a slightly different way, is Magic Zoom will always use the timeline resolution. So, if you've got 4K clip on a 1080p timeline, when you zoom in, you're zooming into 1080p, not 4K, which is really annoying. This is a slightly different issue, but now we know they're looking at this sort of thing. Hopefully they give us the ability to work the other way so that my plugins can use the source resolution, not the timeline resolution. That sounds confusing, but the people that are using it and have this issue will know what I'm talking about. I'm excited, because hopefully it means they'll give us the ability to do it the other way around in the future. Anyway, talking about Fusion stuff, they've added something else, which is super handy, but only for a relatively small, kind of neat section of you. And that is it's easier to edit controls within Fusion. What do I mean by that? Well, when you're making macros, when you're making your own plugins or whatever, you have to often create your own user controls. It was always a pain to do, now it's just a little bit easier. For example, I've got this text plus within Fusion. If I wanted to amend any of these controls, I would have to right click on the heading name or on the node, come down to edit controls. There's a giant list of all the controls that have to find the one that I want, size one, and then amend it. Now what you can do is simply go to the control over in the inspector, right click, come down to edit control, and you'll jump straight to that correct one. A, it's faster, and B, you always know you're looking at the correct thing. And then we can change it, customize it, do what we want, click okay. And now we've created a custom control, which we can customize further if we need to. Hopefully they continue to do some more work to make making macros that little bit easier because there's still some oddities, like they always go to the very bottom. I'd like to be able to reorder them please. Anyway, stuff like that, hopefully continues to improve. Next up, we now have the ability to record voiceovers in 32-bit float. Audio stuff, fair lie. But basically 32-bit float is like a high dynamic ranged audio recording. So if you recorded with your volume too high, it doesn't all get clipped. You can still recover some of that information so the recording still sounds pretty good. Now you do need to make sure that everything else in the pipeline is set up to actually record 32-bit float. If you're using a microphone, which can't do 32-bit, then it's not really gonna make much of a difference. But providing everything else is set up, then it's really easy to actually enable this within DaVinci Resolve itself. All you need to do, click on the little cog or gear in the bottom right-hand corner to open up your project settings. Come down to this Fairlight tab in the middle, use 32-bit float recording, give that a tick, and then hit Save. Now whenever we go to our voiceover, which is this that I like on here, to open up our record voiceover window, we can select the name, select the microphone we want to use, and then when we actually record, it will be recorded in 32-bit float. Again, just make sure that everything else is set up to actually get 32-bits of goodness. Magic Mask 2, which is awesome by the way, is now available within Fusion. This is a studio-only feature, by the way, but you probably knew that already. Let me show you how it works. So all we need to do, I'm gonna open this clip up in the Fusion page. Here it is, we're gonna search for the Magic Mask. We'll drop that node on there, and if we have a look, it's all different. This is Magic Mask 2. It works in pretty much the same way, so if I click on this lady's face, it's just gonna pick up her face and get rid of everything else. If you need to be able to see what you're clicking on the easiest way, put Magic Mask over on this preview. I'm gonna put my media in on the left-hand preview, because we can still click over here, and we'll click on her hair as well. You click now rather than dragging. There's a few weird bits, so let's just give something else a click, and it's picked all of that up, and if we wanted to track, we would simply track. That's on faster, let's change it to better to see if it does a better job. Generally it does. Done a really good job here with the hair. We can refine the range, we can add and remove strokes, do all the things you'd usually do, and then if we hit track, it's just gonna do our Magic Mask tracking, just like that. We've got a little bit of weirdness going around the hair. That's the refined edge. We could tweak this, but overall, if you have a look, it's doing a pretty good job. Next up, we have a couple of studio-only color page additions for me to whip through really quick, and we're gonna start off with the Color Tone Diffuser. This is really nice. It's basically an effect which brings up the shadows, and it adds like a low contrast sort of diffused look. It's reminiscent of what you'd see in the old days with film, and it's a look lots of people kind of go for, especially in photos, people kind of bring up the shadows and go for this low contrast sort of look. You can now do it all using this single new effect on the color page. So I've got a new node here. Here's my base image. I'm gonna use my little shortcut, and we're gonna search for the Color Tone Diffuser, which I've already done. So we'll drop that on there like so. By default, it comes in as a clean plate. You've got a bunch of options, so you can come in and just start messing with these, or you can use one of the presets. So if we go for subtle, this just brings up the shadows and gives us this low contrast sort of look. We've got a low contrast one for lower contrast, strong start, teal soft, which adds a little bit of teal into those shadows, teal high contrast, comfy couch, warm dinner, or you can come along, go to custom and just customize as you like. Or you can start from one of these and then mess around with all the settings. So we've got color space controls, we've got diffusion settings, the soft clip, highlight clips, tone lights, fall off image adjustments, loads of fun stuff to have a play with in there to create different looks directly from this one tool. I haven't had enough time to really figure all of that out just yet, but I like it by the looks things, and I wanna have a little play with it, so stay tuned for a future video. On a similar note, split tone. So split toning is when you add different colors to the highlight and the shadows, effectively, they've added a dedicated tool to allow you to do exactly that with a little bit more control. So once again, let's just search for split tone, and we'll add that onto this node. Once again, we've got some different kind of presets, natural, strong or custom, let's go with strong, and then we've got the strength, the pivot, the hue angle. So if you want this to be really strong, then we've got the pivot, how much we want to be affecting the shadows versus the highlights, and then we've got the hue angle, which is basically which two contrasting colors that we want to use. One of them will go in the highlights, and one of them will go in the shadows. This is obviously too strong, but you know, you can come along, and you mess with this to get it looking however you like. This used to be only available to do within the Film Look Creator. Now there's a dedicated split tone tool instead. And talking of the Film Look Creator, they have added the strong and natural presets within the split toning, within the Film Look Creator as well. Now on the color page, there are some others as well, so let's run through these really quickly. The first, they've added the ability to add grain to skin when using face refinement. And lastly, they've also made some improvements to both the light rays and the glow effects. They've added some atmospheric controls that you can mess around with, and secondary glow within glow. So jump into those if you want to have a play. So I think that pretty much covers most of the things I wanted to cover. Of course, there are still things I haven't talked about. They've changed Smart Reframe, so you now have some additional options rather than just controlling everything, you can set it to either be pan only or tilt only. There's some shortcuts for enabling and disabling clips, some shortcuts for zooming in and out of your timeline. There's a bunch of stuff, so just have a little look to see if there's anything important that I missed. I think that's about it though. Let me know your favorite features, let me know your thoughts and feelings down in the comments section below. You'll be seeing a bit more of me on YouTube over the next coming weeks, so we're back to making more regular videos. So hopefully I'll see you around. Take it easy, I'll see you next time.
