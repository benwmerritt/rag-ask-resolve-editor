So here we are within DaVinci Resolve and we're currently on the edit tab. I've already got a clip set up on my timeline and as you can see It's already completely filling my frame like so, but let's say we want to move it around There's actually two ways to do it. You can either do it visually on the preview window or you can do it within the inspector I'm going to show you both. We'll start with the visual method first So underneath your preview window, you should see this little icon and this little drop down here Give the little drop down a click and you can see you've got a few options Now transform has this icon next to it's the square with the four little points. Just give them a click Now whenever you see that square down here You can just activate these transform controls by giving that button a click to activate or deactivate If you see any of the other icons, so let's say you've got the pen icon here for annotation You just need to use the drop down to then switch to the transform tools With these transform tools activated you can see all these points appearing on your preview window So if we want to resize it all we need to do is click on either the four corners We can just drag in and drag out without affecting our aspect ratio Now if we want to stretch our video you use these little dots on either the sides top or bottom And then we can stretch our video like so To actually move your video around just click anywhere within the frame and you can just drag it around with your mouse like so To rotate you can see you've got these two little points in the middle We just click on this top one hold our mouse and then we can just drag to the left to the right to rotate our image Now another quick tip for you here You can see there's this circle has appeared if I drag my mouse down I can make the circle smaller and if there's a smaller circle I can rotate faster like so If I drag my mouse up to make this circle bigger I can rotate slower which would gives me finer control over the rotation Now lastly you can see that we're rotating around the middle here We're actually rotating around this icon here If you give that a click and move that you can move that to wherever you want it So let me just put on this guy's face and then if I rotate you can see we're now rotating around that point instead That's called your anchor point Now that's the visual method using the preview window. There's another method using the inspector So still with your clip selected on the timeline open up the inspector in the top right hand corner And you should see the word transform Now I've got no options open here because my transforms closed So all I need to do is double click on the word transform to show these options Now these generally correlate to what we've just been doing so we've got zoom position rotation anchor point pitch your and then flip So to control them by the inspector all you do Hover your mouse over the actual numbers and you can see your cursor will change Click your mouse and then you can just drag so I can drag left to zoom out right to zoom in I'm not stretching it. It's maintaining the aspect ratio Which is the default setting if I want to stretch it I can just untick this little chain icon and then I control my x and y zooms independently Position is exactly the same so I can just click and drag to move the x and y's accordingly Rotation angle I can either use the little slider in the middle or again I can hold for my mouse click and drag on the number The anchor point is the same so I can move that left and right and then you've also got pitch Which changes the pitch you've got your and then you've got flip horizontally and then you've got vertically Now if you want to reset anything you've changed there's two ways to do it You can either double click on the actual word So I've got the word zoom here and just going to double click my mouse and It'll reset to my zoom to the default parameters Or we can use this little sort of refresh icon over the right-hand side So I'm going to do my position now. I'm going to give that a click and it'll reset the position If I want to reset everything within the transform area if I just move my mouse up a little bit We've got the same refresh icon, but this time it's next to the word transform You can give that a click and that reset everything to the default parameters So as a quick practical demonstration, I'm just going to grab my logo from my media pool Drag it onto my timeline above my video like so and then release my mouse I can give that logo a click. I still have my transform tools enabled So then I can just click on this bottom left hand corner Drag in and then I can just click and drag it over Put my logo in the bottom right hand corner as I want it Alternatively, I could have used the parameters within the inspector Now another example is for picture-in-picture So I'm just going to grab another video from my media pool drag that onto my timeline above this one And again, we can just give it a click on our timeline We've got our tools active or we can use the transform tools within the inspector We can just zoom that out make it a little bit smaller Drag it to wherever I want it and then if we hit play We've got the two videos running at once, which is exactly what we want I've made all these transform changes up here But let's say I want to see what it was like before and do maybe a quick before and after comparison All I need to do next to the word transform here within the inspector There's a little toggle switch if I just turn that off I can see what my clip would look like without any of the transform options applied And then I can just turn it on again To enable those so we can just flick it on and off to do a quick before and after comparison Now last quick tip It's really easy to copy and paste any of those transform attributes from one clip to another All we're going to do is right click on the clip we want to copy from on our timeline And then we're going to go to copy or we can use the keyboard shortcut of control and c And then we're going to click on the clip that we want to paste those attributes to Or right click again and this time we're going to go to paste attributes Or we could have used the keyboard shortcut of alt and v This a paste attributes window will appear and then we can just click the attributes we want to copy So I'm just going to have zoom ticked. I'm not going to bother with the scale or the rotation or anything like that Just zoom and then I can click on apply And as you can see it's copied those zoom attributes from our first clip onto our second clip And it's as easy as that to transform and copy and paste transform attributes within the edit tab And that's it.
