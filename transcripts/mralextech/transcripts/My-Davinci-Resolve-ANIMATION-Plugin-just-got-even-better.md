Hey what up folks it's Alex here I hope you're all well today I wanted to talk about Magic Toolkit and Magic Animate. Now if you didn't know at the end of last year I released my Magic Animate version 3 it's a little plug-in for DaVinci Resolve which allows you to create simple repeatable dynamic animations directly on the edit page within DaVinci Resolve without messing around with keyframes. It doesn't revolutionise the game it's just there to make doing those animations much quicker simpler and easier. Now there's a free version which is completely free you can download that right now without spending a penny and then there's also a paid premium version I've linked them both down below so if you want to go check them out you can do. So first of all thank you thank you to everyone that decided to pick Magic Animate version 3 up I've had loads of sales and I've had loads of really positive feedback so yeah first things first thank you thank you ever so much if you have purchased it or even if you're using the free version I'd love to know your thoughts please let me know any positive negative neutral comments thoughts feedback whatever down in the comments below it's always appreciated. So I wanted to jump on and give you two different types of updates first one I want to give you is what's next so originally I had planned to quite quickly and consecutively bring out a bunch more plugins and then sell it all as a big tool kit called the Magic Toolkit. Some things happened in my personal life and I've been really busy and I just haven't been able to keep up with that I am now months behind my original schedule. So I wanted to let you know firstly I apologise for that I had high hopes of being able to bring it all out really quickly and it all kind of fell apart but I am going to get back on that very soon I've got a few days off with my lovely wife because it's our anniversary and then I'm going to come back and my main priority is working on the next big thing for the Magic Toolkit so that's the goal don't hold me to it but I will do my absolute best and the original plan still stands I'm going to try and come out with a handful of them over the next weeks months whatever to build this up into this big toolkit which hopefully solves loads of your issues so that you can just work faster and work a little bit more efficiently in DaVinci Resolve to do those fancy animations so I haven't forgotten I haven't abandoned the project or anything like that it just stuff got in the way but we're going to pick that back up and my update number two is just about Magic Animate version three itself so the only video I haven't made about Magic Animate version three was the original one on this channel and that was when it first came out since then it has been updated and it's much nicer it's much more organized and it has some additional features now these features were introduced into Magic Animate like two months ago so quite a while ago so if you've downloaded it within the past couple of months you will have already had access to these features I just never got around to making a YouTube video telling everyone else what's new which is why we're here today so let's jump into the edit page and jump open so let's jump into it you know what I'm going to do I'm going to open resolve and I'm going to show you some stuff so let's do that so here we are edit page in DaVinci Resolve now first things first in the effects library tool box effects magic toolkit magic animate the first thing you'll notice if you've seen the original version is this is much better organized it has nicer folders and we've got thumbnails so we've got this number one magic animate folder which has our main two custom controls we then have creator tools which allow you to do some other simple stuff so they're kind of the same as the main controls but have some additional things enabled and then underneath there we've got presets and we've got loads of folders within here of all these different presets which do is do which do different things so you have access to all of this this is all the premium version by the way the free version just has access to this main magic animate v3 tool next new feature we added was zoom pivot so magic animate allows you to zoom out and of course zoom in and one of the things that a lot of people wanted was the ability to change the point that you're zooming in to now this ability kind of comes from my magic zoom tool which is completely free it's still available still works fine by the way that's linked down below but we've kind of incorporated some of that ability within magic animate I am still going to work on a new version of magic zoom as well but for now within magic animate you can do some nice pinpointing on your zooms you can do it via the magic animate saver or also made a zoom in's little creator tools so we're going to use the zoom in's and all this really does is it has the zoom in set by default so you don't have to go around changing the amount and it does also work slightly differently with the shake which I'll get back to in a moment so I'm going to just tick my zoom in's it's going to zoom in and then we can change the pivot like so and if we enable our little fusion overlay bad example it's kind of green on green but there it is you've got your little handle you can move this around and you can change the point that you're zooming in to you can then of course save this into user presets so you can customize them as you like but I also added right at the bottom of here a bunch of zoom presets so we've got a bottom left bottom right bottom center yada yada yada so let's get rid of this I've got one here called your center and it just adds a bit of your and zooms into the middle you could then customize that however you wish save it into your own user presets and again you get the idea custom zooms sorted now talking of saving your own things back into the venture resolve the downside to magic animate is it has all of these calculations going on in the background which can sometimes slow things down within the save at all which of course allows you to save these back in I added the ability to turn off things that you didn't want to use that both cleans up the user interface and it makes the performance much better because it's not doing unnecessarily unnecessary it's not doing unnecessary calculations in the background however I've sped up the whole process by adding an auto disable button so we've got a brand new saver on here and let's just toggle on zooms I don't know give it some spins and some dissolves let's change the zoom and spin amount whatever something like that it's going to go we like so now in the admin page there's an auto disable button at the very top we hit that we don't have to come through and disable everything like we used to go back to the controls page and we now only have access to zooms spins and dissolves and all of the other things are no longer doing the calculations in the background so the whole little plug-in little animation will run smoother of course you can come back to admin at any point and you can enable any of the things that you do want access to and then they will reappear simple now using the ins and outs is great it's super handy to be able to do that but one of the main things that people really like about this tool is the mid animations being able to do shakes and have things move around during the middle of the animation which is much harder to keyframe you have to go and use expressions or modifiers or whatever now my previous attempt at this was really fancy but it was a little bit complicated so you could do funky stuff but you would have to spend some time setting it up I've since added different shake ability now the shake ability is essentially the camera shake function within fusion but I've just tweaked it a bit changed some of its wording changed how it works ever so slightly and it allows you to do some shaky stuff really quickly and really easily so for this one we're going to use the resolve logo let's grab saver drop that on there let's do a zoom so it pops in like so let's turn everything off so it works nice and quickly and then we've just got this little zoom in like so now under mids we have shake and if we just turn that on we have all of these controls so if we hit play it's just going to do a little bit of a shake for us we can increase the motion scale the speed scale and we can add some super efficient motion blur as well we can change the in and out curves so kind of how quickly this shake ramps in and out and then in this shake movement we've got like the horizontal scale so if we increase that it's going to have loads of left and rightness we can knock the vertical down so it's just left and right we can add loads of rotation you can't see it let's do that right up and let's bring that up so it's having a little bit of a wobble we can also then add zoom as well so it zooms in and out like so we can change the zoom type to inwards and it's going to do a little bounce and a little shake like so that's a little bit crazy but you get the idea of how it works there's also randomness you can come in you can change all of this to get it looking however you want it have some fun with it mess around with it that's obviously a little bit crazy but you get the idea you have access to all these different types of shakes that are really quick simple and easy to customize next up masks so in the original one you could do a rectangular mask uh you could customize it to make it square if you wanted but it's rectangular by default and then you also had a circular and ellipse mask they all worked really well but i wanted to add some additional control so i added a polygon mask and that allows you to do a mask on the edit page of any shape and size that you like and the border still works as well so we're back to using this example we'll drop the saver on there in magic anime we're going to jump to masks and there's an option down here enable polygon we'll click that and our screen is going to go black what we need to do under our preview make sure you're on the fusion overlay and then you can simply click around make whatever shape you like do do do do complete it and there you go you've got your custom little mask you can adjust all these edges you can move them around you can smooth them you can do all the stuff that you'd expect then scroll down and enable the border and there you go we have a colored border change the color do whatever you want to that and job done something cool to mention here there's this filter so by default it's kind of hard to see let's zoom in you've got these kind of rough pointy edges if we change this filter to be circle you get nice circular edges and it just makes the whole thing look a little bit nicer the animations still work with this so within this mask area we can actually have this to be animated so now it's an animated mask so the mask pops in and of course you can then go and save this and it will save that custom polygon mask at the same time and talking of saving this isn't a new process but I wanted to just whip through it really quickly so we've got our little animated mask on here we've gone to admin and we'll do an auto disable to make sure it runs nice and smooth to save it into our effects library we simply click on save and as you can see there's some instructions in here we need to jump onto fusion and then do a control c so we click on this little icon in the top right hand corner open in fusion then from here we highlight the actual node down here and then do a control c or right click and copy whichever you prefer and then there's type we can change that if we need to although it should default to the correct one depending on what you're using you can set up a custom folder if you want to and then you give it a name so I'm going to call this squeagles and then simply hit save it'll give you a little status message down here to let you know if it's worked and hopefully if we jump back now over to the edit page within effects magic toolkit magic animate we now have a number four user presets and within there we have squiggles so you can delete this one grab squiggles drop it on there and it's always going to be in our effects library ready to go next up magic background one of my original magic animate version two tools had something in it called magic background I've adopted that kind of tweaked it made it I think better and it now exists within magic animate version three as well so for this one let's just grab this clip again for an example and then we're going to grab in this created tools we have generator background so we're going to drop that straight on our footage like so and it's going to look like nothing has happened in the inspector we have all of the same controls we usually would so we can zoom we can whip we could spin and all that is going to be applied to this footage however there's a bg little tab at the top and from here we can add a little background logo so we're going to get to browse because what you have to do is actually browse your system for the logo for the png so i'm going to go ahead and grab this png down here of just the resolve logo you need to make sure your png hasn't got loads of numbers at the end if it's in a big folder because that can mess things up but let's just grab this resolve logo png and if we go back to controls let's just move this out of the way and there you go so you've created this background with that logo which means if we were to animate this as a whip for example we've got it in the background or another example let's do a zoom let's make it zoom out a little bit so if we want to just demo something with my video clip to just zoom out but then show this funky background we can do now within the bg area we can change the size of the logo the separation the angle the stagger angle so that's kind of the the angle of the entire thing how much movement we have and even the movement angle itself there's also then a bunch of additional controls like we can add a drop shadow to the logo we can change the color of the background behind the logo we can change the brightness levels we can add a vignette we can add a blur which i really like so we can give this a bit of a blur like so and then there's also a fake kind of tilt shift effect which i've made as a fake effect because then it will work on both the free and studio versions of DaVinci resolve so now we've got this nice kind of tilt shift looking blur effect thing and then we've also got a tv effect which will put grid lines on it it will look weird on a small screen but if we make that big screen like so you can see it's working pretty well we've got noise we've got scan lines it looks pretty funky i think and then we've also got perspective so we can enable that and then start to tweak the perspective move that around full screen that hit play and there you go now obviously the more things you enable the chill gear it's going to run but it's not too bad and i think it looks pretty cool now one of the nice things about that is because you're picking that png up of your system rather than out of your effects library or media pool even rather than out of your media pool when you save this generator background effect it will always remember what image what png what logo you're looking to so i recommend that you just set a logo up on your system somewhere you know save it in a space a nice folder that's nice and secure and isn't going to get renamed or moved and then every time you use this effect it's always going to go and grab that logo for you so it's ready to go now i'll demonstrate how that works in the next new edition because i also made that background generator as a generator so an effect has to be applied to a clip so i applied that one to that droney shot of the beach and then you move that out the way and you can see the background underneath sometimes you may just want the background itself because you want to put a title over the top of it or whatever i made a couple of generators which do exactly that so these of sit under generators magic toolkit magic anime there's only two of them there's an image generator i'll come back to you in a second and then there's magic background so we'll put this on this doesn't need to be applied to anything because it's a generator it sits as its own thing on the timeline and then we go to browse so i'm being naughty and just using my downloads because i'm lazy we're going to grab that we can tweak this however we want let's just give it some perspective like so and then we've got this real simple little animated background do you think same as you usually would you go to save we have to jump on to the fusion page to get this to work so we're going to click on our little icon we're going to do a copy and then we're going to give it a name put res logo we can change where it saves and we can give it a custom folder if we want to and then we hit save and then if we jump back over to the edit page magic toolkit magic anime we now have a user preset res logo just delete that any time now we just grab that it's got all of our tweaks on it and it's automatically going to go to that folder and pick up that logo which is perfect for using your own logo handy right now sometimes you may want to use your own logo or a subscribe button or some other png some other image whatever it may be without using it as a background that's where the other little generator comes in the last thing i'm going to show you in this video and that is the image generator so creator tools in the generators image generator once again it sits as its very own thing on the timeline and we're going to go to browse same again let's grab the resolve logo we'll zoom this out and let's just pretend i want this to quite often pop in in the bottom left hand corner of my videos so i've put it down there bottom left and we can change the size we can change the aspect the angle all that sort of stuff we then have all of the usual magic animate controls so let's do a little zoom and dissolve as well keep it nice and simple so now when we hit play it's just going to zoom and dissolve in let's also do some little shaky jake on there there's a bit much but you know gives you the idea got a shake we've also got masks we can do loads of stuff with that we then go to admin auto disable to get rid of the stuff we don't want this to do and then we can go to save once again let's jump into fusion quick copy on that i'm going to call this one res logo again nice that makes sense doesn't it but there you go save that back to the edit page you can delete that now and within our effects library magic toolkit resolve logo again lengthen that out let's put some footage underneath so we can see what this is actually going to do and wherever that generator is the resolve logo it's just going to zoom in and do whatever we told it to do and again completely dynamic we can shorten that and it will just go away and we can cut it in half and then we've got two of them and if we wanted a second version to animate in a bit differently we just open up the controls within the inspector tweak it change it do whatever we want save it and then we have a second version within our user presets or we could even make a third folder and it's all good to go that's the updates i've already done to magic animates version three and that's a summary of what's coming up i apologize this video was so long hopefully you enjoyed it thanks for watching take it easy and i will see you all very very soon indeed see you
