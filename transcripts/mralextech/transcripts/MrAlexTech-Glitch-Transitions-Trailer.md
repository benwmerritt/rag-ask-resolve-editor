What up folks, I hope you're all well. As you may know, I've been working on a glitch transitions pack for you all, so I thought I'd give you all a quick demonstration. Now a few quick things before we do, they are proper drag and drop transitions, so they will appear as video transitions within DaVinci Resolve. You can drag them on to any project, so that's any resolution, any frame rate. They are completely scalable, so you can drag them as long and short as you like, and they are customizable to a point. Now the pack will be free as always, but I will be asking for donations, not to me this time, but it's actually to a charity of my choice. There's going to be another video on that coming to the channel very soon, so please do keep your eyes out for that. Now I hope you're doing well and staying safe and all that jazz, so yeah, that's all I have to say. Let me...show you these transitions.
