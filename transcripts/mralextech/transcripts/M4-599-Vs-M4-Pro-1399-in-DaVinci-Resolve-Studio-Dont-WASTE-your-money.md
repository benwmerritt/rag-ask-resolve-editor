## Transcript
In my previous video, we tested to see if the base model Mac Mini is any good at editing when using the free version of DaVinci Resolve. And it was. Definitely watch that video first if you want to see the general timeline performance of these Mac Minis. But a lot of you had questions. Is it good enough for DaVinci Resolve Studio? And how does it compare to the M4 Pro version Well, I've got one of those here. So we're going to do a bit of a comparison and see how they both perform in DaVinci Resolve Studio. Plus, I've thrown in my own M3 MacBook Pro just for a bit of a comparison as well. So I've set up a few demonstrations just to give you a rough idea of how all of this thing works. And we're going to do some render kind of timelines as well. So you've got some direct numbers to compare. So let's jump into DaVinci Resolve and start off with a nice simple comparison. Oh, and before I forget, all of the live demonstration stuff is being recorded on the base model M4. So let's open and resolve and get into it. And it is this is an eight minute vlog. All of this footage right here is 264 10 bit 422 25 and it's 4k. The timeline is 4k. We're not using any proxies. And let's just make sure the playback is set to full resolution. And generally the timeline performance for this is really quite nice. It's quite a simple project. We haven't done too much. We've just cut things up. There's no color grading because I actually shot it with a lot to kind of baked in. We are using a small amount of studio features because I have this nice track here, but I wanted to get rid of the vocals. So this has no voice. So we're using the music remixer. And anyone that's ever used the music remixer, it can start to chug things up a little bit. But this is working really quite nicely. Now there's a tiny amount of delay when moving the playhead like the tiniest amount. But that is being caused by this. If we delete that, it's actually much, much snappier and we can come in and we can delete things. And it's all quite nice. If we undo all of that, it is still is pretty snappy. This is just a tiny, tiny difference, but it's it's pretty solid. And the performance on the pro is not noticeably better. To be honest, they're pretty much identical in that regard. Now I ran off some export of this project. The M4, the bass model did that project in two minutes and 11 seconds. The M4 Pro two minutes and six seconds and the M3 MacBook Pro two minutes and 29 seconds. So all of them were basically identical. Now as mentioned, there's not a huge amount going on in that one, but it's still an eight minute 4k project with some decent footage and a little bit of AI stuff going on. So that's not too bad. Now just sticking in this project for a second, let me just give you another quick demonstration of some of the AI based audio stuff. So on this timeline here, we've got audio one, this has got my vocals. Let's just go and enable the dialogue separator, which allows you to knock down the background and the ambience and bring up the voices and mute different things. And this historically has caused a bit of delay. Let's just see how that plays. There's a tiny pause now when you move your playhead as it's kind of rethinking, but we're still getting 25 frames. We can still move around this timeline pretty quickly. We can start to ripple delete things and it'll close those gaps without too much of an issue. Slight delay, but nothing too major. And it's not doing too bad of a job. In a lot of these areas, we do have the music remix on. And of course, now we have that dialogue separator over the entire track. If we select some audio here as well, and then let's turn on the voice isolation as well. So we've got all three going on, hit play. It's still doing 25. There's that tiny pause as we move our playhead. But overall, still pretty solid. And here's doing the exact same thing on the M4 Pro version. And it's pretty much the same. All of these devices, the M4 line, they all actually have the same size neural engine. It's a 16 core neural engine. So a lot of these kind of AI based effects, which use those neural engine stuff will probably be very similar. There may be some differences, but it's mostly going to be down to the CPU and the GPU, rather than the neural engine itself, because they're all the same. Right, let's open a slightly bigger project. This is my DaVinci Resolve 19.1 update video. And once again, everything's 4K. I've got some 4K screen capture stuff. And my main footage is 4K. Once again, it's all 264, 10 bit, 4234K, yada, yada, yada. No proxies, nothing else going on there. And this project, I actually edited and cut and published on that base model M4. And again, really snappy. I had no issues putting this together. It's really quite good. It doesn't use a huge amount of studio only effects. Once again, there's a tiny bit of magic mass going on at the beginning. Now, the reason we're looking at this project though, is because I used lots. That fell down. So the reason we're looking at this project though is because it does have a lot of titles going on. So this bit here, for example, we've got this new generator, fusion generator going on. And we've also got some nice titles by MotionVFX. Now this does run. It will get through. But you'll get about double the FPS running this on the M4 Mac Pro. So the Pro is faster when it starts to do this kind of fusion-y stuff. And there's quite a lot of that over this timeline. So this is about a 20-minute timeline. The M4 base model did this in 17 minutes and 18 seconds. The M4 Pro model did this in 10 minutes and 22 seconds. So seven minutes faster, but it still got through it. It just meant you had to wait an extra seven minutes. So a lot of this video is going to be me saying, it really depends how important that is to you. Because how important is that seven minutes to you? I mean, that's up for you to decide, really. Something else I'm going to say a lot in this video is this. If we go to playback timeline playback resolution, just change this to half. Now this doesn't generate any proxies. It just lowers the resolution of this preview. And then if we hit play, we get much faster FPS. It almost plays at real time. It kind of skips a few. But it's not too bad at all. And if you do that on both, they both almost have real-time playback. And there's a very, very little difference between the actual timeline performance again between the M4 and the M4 Pro. When you render, you'll still have that seven-minute difference. But on the actual editing side of things on the timeline, not much in it, really. Right. Now, before we jump into the next one, I just need to let you know that this video's sponsor, Motion VFX, are having a site-wide 30% off sale. But it's for a limited time only. This is only available up to the 4th of December. All of the Fusion titles you've seen in any of these demo projects are, of course, from Motion VFX. And all of the split screens, graphs, transitions, and titles in this very video are also from Motion VFX. And they've got a wide range of plugins available for DaVinci Resolve, like this M presentation plugin, which contains everything you need to create top quality presentations in no time. Or if you're into the clean Apple aesthetic, why not check out the M Keynote plugin, which contains over 100 simple, essential assets. To check out the range of Motion VFX plugins for DaVinci Resolve, simply click on that link down in the description below. And then to get that 30% off, just use the code BW30 at checkout. BW30, 30% off. You've got until the 4th of December. Job done. Right. Let's crack on. Now, sticking with titles and Fusion-y stuff, Fusion does start to step ahead. Now, I downloaded the Fusion spaceship example you can actually get from Blackmagic. I didn't know this existed until someone tagged me on Twitter. And this is an entire project. So you have to run this in the standalone version of Fusion rather than within Fusion within DaVinci Resolve itself. But it's a good indicator just to show you how Fusion works on these different devices. It also uses very, very little memory. I checked this. It was only using a couple of gigs worth of RAM, unified memory. So that isn't a limiting factor in this test. The M4 base model came out at 45 minutes and 50 seconds. The M4 Pro, 27 minutes and 28 seconds. The M3 MacBook, 50 minutes and 45 seconds. Obviously, that's over a big extended render. If it's just a few titles on the timeline, you're not going to notice that much of a difference. Right. Now, let's jump into some of the individual smaller sort of studio-only effects. I've set up a really simple timeline. We're just going to apply some of these effects and see how they play back in real time. Now, the footage I've used for this is just standard 4K stuff I found on the internet. Now, the reason I'm doing that is so you can download it for yourself. So in the description below, there are a handful of links to all of the footage I'm about to use for this real-time demonstration. So if you've got studio installed, you can create your own timeline that looks very similar to this and apply the same effects and do some comparisons for yourself. We're going to kick things off with Magic Masks. So I've got this simple footage here. It is 4K. Don't know what the codec is. H.L.T.S.T. for something or other. 4K. Yada, yada, yada. We are not using any proxies and just to make sure. Let's put this back to full. That's good to go. Now, if we jump onto the color page, we're just going to jump straight down to the Magic Masks. No messing around. Give this a bit of a squiggle. We're going to keep it on faster. Just gives it a bit easier. Put the overlay on. That's picked that up already. And we're going to track. And we'll see what this gets. And so far, after a couple of seconds, we're getting about 9 FPS. It jumps. Sometimes it drops to 8. Then it sits at 9. Maybe it'll hit 10 in a second. Then it comes back to 9. But it seems to kind of average out at about 9 FPS. Running the same thing on the M4 Pro does generally net you a few additional frames. Not many, but a couple. Now, once that's done, let's just toggle that off. And we'll give it something really silly. Once that is done, if we jump back onto the edit page, it will play back nicely in real time. So once the tracking's done, you can still then come in here and it'll all delete and you can do all the stuff. Playback is pretty solid. Next up, we've got this footage here and we want to de-noise it. Now, using the noise reduction is very, very heavy. And that does prove the case when trying to do it on the M4. So we've got this footage here. We're going to jump into the noise reduction. We'll do one frame faster. We'll do 10, 10, and 10, and hit play. And it's going to struggle. It's going to drop frames. Noise reduction, as mentioned, is very, very difficult to do in the Vintage Resolve. It always needs lots of horsepower. And this base model M4 just doesn't quite cut it. Now, the M4 Pro does fare better. We can get one frame in real time. We can go all the way up to three frames and still get real time. But then when we go to five frames, we end up at about 20 FPS. So we do then start to lose some frames, but it is better than the base model M4. The same thing applies if you're using the spatial noise reduction as well. This is all just a little bit heavy for the GPU within this base model M4. And it does start to stretch the Pro version as well. But once again, like I mentioned previously, there is kind of a solution. So if this was me, let's leave it on five. Why not? I would zoom in. This is not a great example because this footage is not really good. It's all compressed and horrible, but I wanted to so you could download it as well. And let's say that we tweaked this just a small amount and we said, yes, we're happy with this. But obviously, we only get a few frames per second. But we've done all this at the full resolution of the playback. We're happy with it. We can then just come down and go right half. And now we're back up to 25 frames. We're back into real time. And we're going to the edit page. We can wiggle around and this plays back. Absolutely fine. We can copy. We can cut. So we can do all sorts of stuff. And it's good to go. So when you're trying to preview it back at the full resolution, it really drops the frames. You can then set it and change it to half and then playback and it's not too bad. So again, that kind of comes down to you and how much of a priority that sort of thing is. There's a very quick and easy solution to get it to playback so you can cut things together nicely on the timeline. Just bear in mind when you do render that, it is going to be at that less than real time frame rates. So it's going to be considerably slower. Super scaling is very, very similar. So this is the 2x enhanced. And we're getting about six frames. This is at the full resolution. We can go to 2x and we get real time. If we go to 3x, we're back up to real time. And if we go to 4x, these are the non-enhanced versions. We drop frames. It says 25, but it looks slightly janky. I think it's dropping a couple even though it says 25. Well, you know, it's close. Now the M4 Pro does fair a little bit better. The standard 2 and 3 are absolutely fine in real time. 4 is pretty good. It's very, very close. Again, it looks slightly choppy even though it's saying it's real time. And the 2x enhanced drops us to about 11 FPS. On to the film look creator. Just dropping that on there, leaving it as the default 65mm. Hit play and we're going to drop some frames. So this is running about 10 FPS. It says it's caught up to 25. If we go to the color page, we can usually get a more accurate reading. Yeah, it's not. We're running at about 12-ish FPS. On the M4 Pro, I'll do a little side by side here. You can see it is quicker, but it's still not real time in this example. Now a lot of this is simply caused by the grain. We toggle that off. We will get more frames. Still not real time. Always having to think close to real time, but not quite. And then halation. We disable that and we're back up to real time. So you can use everything with the exception of those two. Those two starts to kind of trip it up and that's when you start to lose some frames. Whereas on the M4 Pro, once you've disabled grain, you do jump back up to the real time playback. But of course on either, you could change that playback resolution to half once again and get real time on both. And last but not least, speed warp. So this clip here has been slowed down to 20 and it's got optical flow on there at the moment. And that'll play back with no issues. If we go to the motion estimation, speed warp faster, hit play and we're going to drop a lot of frames. So we're only going to be sitting at a couple 2.5, 3 ish FPS on that one. The M4 Pro, not much better. It's double. So technically it is better, but it's still only four FPS. Now changing this to B speed warp better, which is better, but it's obviously considerably harder to run. We hit play on this one. And we're going to be sitting one, one and a half, two FPS on that one. Once again, the M4 Pro being twice as fast, but still only getting us about two or three frames. Now all of those, especially the denies, super scale, the speed warps, that sort of thing, a super GPU heavy. It was only kind of recently with the 40 series and when DaVinci Resolve got a little bit faster, that you could do a lot of those things in real time with a big fat, chunky, powerful GPU. And the Mac mini is about the same size as a side salad. So there you go. But anyway, that's using those sorts of things over really short clips. Let's give you a real world example as well. So this is one of the videos I created for my YouTube channel. There's quite a bit of effects. There's quite a bit of fusion going on in here. We do lots of sort of cutaways with backgrounds and poppins and arrows and titles and all that sort of stuff. But there's two versions of this. So what I quite often like to do is to apply a bit of halation to my videos just to make my sign and my lights kind of pop. So this version doesn't have the halation enabled. Whereas this version does. And as you would imagine, we struggle to get real time playback. The solution when it falls editing this would be to set it to half and then it would be absolutely fine. But that is going to have an impact when it comes to the render times. And indeed it does with the halation enabled, the M4 mini jumps up another 10 minutes. That took 25 minutes and three seconds. The M4 Pro 14 minutes and one second. And the M3 MacBook Pro 19 minutes and 26 seconds. Right, moving on. Let's talk subtitles and transcriptions. So we're back on this big long 19.1 video. And we're simply going to go to timeline, create subtitles from audio. We'll leave those as they are and hit create. It's going to blast through this timeline and create us some subtitles. And this is going to create these at about 12 and a half. I got about 12.5 12.7 ish times real speed. So it's going to do this 20 minute timeline in just over a minute a minute and a half ish the M4 Pro marginally quicker, but kind of within margin of error, to be honest, 13 times, so a teeny bit quicker. And the M3 MacBook Pro slower at about 10 10.7. Now running the transcriptions, this is quite a long clip here. Let's just go to the transcriptions, clear it to make sure there's not already there. And we will transcribe this. Now the transcriptions usually a little bit quicker than the subtitles. And I've got about 14.5 at this minute. It generally kind of jumps up a little bit in the tests I've done. I averaged it out at about 14.9, somewhere between 14 and 15 times real speed. The M4 Pro again, just slightly quicker. I got that about 15.5 to 16 ish and the M3 MacBook Pro 13.5 to 14 ish. Nice and specific ish ish. If you're worrying about a point five in terms of transcriptions, yeah. Now to finish this rather long nerdy video out, we've got a benchmark, a big juicy benchmark by our lovely friends over at team two films. So if you're not following team two films and you like DaVinci Resolve, head over there, give them a like and a subscribe because they do some really good stuff. And this is the big chunky project. Now there's actually three timelines. This is the CPU one. This is all red footage, 24 varying resolutions. Some of it's 8K, some of it's 6K. There's kind of bits in between, but it's all really high resolution red footage. Playback is at full. We're not using any proxies and we can scrub through this timeline really quite nicely. We can hit play, we can come through and we can delete things and it'll close the gaps. Once again, all nice and quick. The timeline itself is 4K. Yeah, this is all on the base model. It whips through nicely. There's a mixed timeline as well, which has just a different video codex of different resolutions. So we've got pro-res, we've got red on here, we've got something else. I don't know why that one was. Loads of stuff. And again, we can whip through this quite nicely. It's a little bit slower. But then there's also a really heavy GPU timeline. Now this, things start to slow down quite a lot on this because this is some 8K, no 6K black magic raw with a depth map on it. And if we try to play that, it's really going to struggle as you can imagine. And over here, we've got sort of speed warps and we've got some 6K pro-res and we've got 8K, whatever that is, all with different sorts of effects going on. The base M4 did the GPU timeline in 14 minutes and 22. The M4 Pro taking just 10 minutes and 3. The M3 MacBook Pro 11 minutes and 35. And for some additional context, Leon from Team 2 Films gave us his results from his M1 Max, which ran that one out in 7 minutes and 9. The CPU timeline, the base M4, 7 minutes and 16. The M4 Pro, 4 minutes and 38. The M3 MacBook Pro, 5 minutes and 33. And the M1 Max, 6 minutes and 23. And finally, the mixed timeline, the base M4, 10 minutes and 47. The Pro, 5 minutes and 39. The M3 MacBook Pro, 7 minutes and 27. And the M1 Max, 6 minutes and 15. So that kind of sums it up nicely. The M4 Pro is considerably faster in certain areas, being twice as fast in some of those benchmarks. But at the end of the day, the base model M4 is probably enough for a lot of people and it will chug through pretty much anything you throw at it. You might just have to wait an extra few minutes when it comes to the rendering times. In terms of actual timeline performance, there's very little between them. You can use a lot of those AI kind of audio effects with no real issues. The M4 Pro will only really start to jump ahead when you're doing lots of heavy fusion stuff or you're using lots of GPU heavy features, like noise reduction, super scaling and speed warps and that sort of thing. But it's also more than twice the price. You are getting more unified memory and more storage as well. But still, you're spending £1400 rather than £600. So you just need to decide whether that additional cost is worth it or whether you're quite happy with the performance of the base model and you'll just go and have an extra cup of tea while it renders. It's kind of entirely up to you. Now neither the M4 nor the M4 Pro are going to win in a horsepower race against a decent modern GPU. The kind of the benefit of these, the real place where they shine, is just their ability to decode footage, which is why you get such buttery smooth playback and performance on the timeline. But when it comes to those GPU enabled effects, a big chunky GPU is going to be more efficient at doing those. My PC, for example, can run real time noise reduction and real time speed warps and all that sort of thing without really breaking a sweat. But it's also a 4080, which is twice the size of this thing and probably uses twice the power on its own. So there you go. That kind of summarizes these little Mac minis. They're really nice devices. They are good enough for DaVinci Resolve Studio. The M4 Pro is a little bit better in certain areas. So it depends exactly what features of studio you wish to use. The GPU is the weaker element. The CPU is really, really impressive. I still think the £599 version is a really nice entry point. And it's really small. And it's quite nice to just have on your desk making no noise at all, whipping through your edits. So there you go. That kind of summarizes it all in a nutshell, I think. I apologize if this ending was a bit waffly, but hopefully it's given you enough food for thought. Let me know any comments, feelings and whatever else down in the comments below. Like and subscribe if you are new here. Thank you for watching. I'll see you next time. Bye.
