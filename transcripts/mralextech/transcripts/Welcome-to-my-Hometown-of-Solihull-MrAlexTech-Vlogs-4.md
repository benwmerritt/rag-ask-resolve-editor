What up folks? It's Alex here. Because the lockdown has been stuck we're doing lots of tutorials but I haven't really been out and just messed about for quite a while. So today I've got nothing else much to do so I'm going to get the bike out, go for a bit of a bike ride and I figured I'd just bring you along with me. But first, let's get the bike out. Music And while we're here, as I'm out on the bike, as I'm riding around anyway, I forgot to give you a quick tour of my hometown because I've noticed quite a few comments recently about this accent of mine. Music This is quite bad. Music Music So welcome to my hometown. This little place where I live is called Solil. Music So Solil is next to Birmingham. Solil is a little town. It's got population of about 250,000 I think. That's how my look on Google. So it's not a massive place but it's really quite nice. I certainly can't complain anyway. I've lived here all my life and that's where I get the accent from. We live near Birmingham but not actually in Birmingham. Music Birmingham is regarded as having one of the worst accents in the UK. People hate the Bromley accent. Fortunately, I don't have a thick Bromley accent. This is sort of Birmingham-ish but not really. I do get a few comments on YouTube about something like Michael Cain. You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off. You're only meant to blow the bloody doors. Oh, that's Australian. That's terrible. That's Cockney. That's Londoner. And we're right in the middle of England in the West Midlands. So nice little town, really. The one time I decided to do a vlog on the bike and my front brake decides to start squeaking. Typical, isn't it? Music Authentic English postbox. Caffeineero. Great coffee. Costa. Averiless coffee. Our best. Better than Starbucks, though. Yeah, I need to sort that brake so I don't get back from doing my head in. It'll almost certainly just be the pads. Making contact with the disc as we go. Music Woo! But this is noll. Tiny little place. It's all there is. With one exception. She's over going to go now. This is noll Lux. Come out, mate. Come out. Music Music Whoa. It's not good luck. So this, hey some gents. This is noll Lux. I don't really know anything about him. Music Whoa, there goes my helmet. So this is the noll Lux flight on the Grand Union Canal in the English Midlands. Originally the noll Lux were a series of six narrow Lux but one Lux was removed and the remaining five were modernized into wide Lux during the 1930 Grand Union Canal improvement. Yeah, all I know is it's a really nice little spot to come. It's a really good scenery. You can chill out, have a sandwich, have a drink, take some photos, take some videos, just chill out, whatever. It's a nice little spot. I was going to get the drone up but there's a lot of people here. Quite a lot of them. Quite a few people just chilling out, relaxing with their families and stuff so I'm not going to get the drone up just yet. I don't want to pee everyone off too much and the fact it's a bit windy and I haven't flown my drone in months so I don't want to lose it in a canal because that would be bad. Let me know what you think of my accent. I'm really intrigued. There's some people that have mentioned it. It's getting more common that people mention the accent. I've been speaking to some other YouTubers more on that to come in a separate video and they've all pointed out the accent and how I have a bit of an advantage having a British accent in this Da Vinci Resolve space because I'm the only one. Literally the only British YouTuber unless there's other one out there. Let me know if you find them. All one of one actually. Ben Mills. What's up Ben if you're watching. Ben Mills is a videographer and he talks about Da Vinci Resolve. He's an up and coming guy. I'm actually going to do a podcast with him as well so we can have a chat and get to know each other. So again more information on that. But generally speaking I'm the only dude doing this so yeah apparently my advantage is because of this weird accent and the way that I talk outside of my mouth. I never know I did that. I always talk outside of my mouth until I started making videos and then I realised I'd do it. I'm just waffling now. I apologise. These vlogs I'm not very good at vlogs. One last thing. I used to feel super self conscious doing vlogs and doing videos but I actually don't feel too bad. Hey yesterday. Maybe I'm getting used to it. I can't really because I haven't been on stage but yeah I don't feel like a complete pleb. I'm a little self conscious so keep looking around to see who's watching me but overall not too bad. That's a good thing. I am shooting on the Sony for the A7III and I'm using a little mirror. Hang on a minute. Which I'm going to do a video on because I'm actually going to be seeing myself. I can check my exposure. I can see my levels and it's actually working really well. It's only plastic so I think it's probably 3D printed but it does a really really good job because I've got no flippy out screen on this Sony so you can't see what you're doing. Now I can get my exposure doled in. I can have a play and actually try hopefully. Do more of these. I can actually see that I'm recording. The amount of times before I sat here talking to myself and weren't even bloody recording is yeah. It's not fun when that happens. Anyway onwards. We're heading out now to a place called Borsal Cump. Another nice little village just around the corner from Noel. Out in the sticks again. Proper British pub. Oh I thought they were open. They're family. They'd be rude not to wouldn't it. Alright hang on. Proper old school traditional phone box. Always going to get in it and jump out but it's locked which is really annoying. Now it was worth it. So this road here we're coming up to. It's a funny old road because it's a proper, it's a real distinguishing line between the countryside and the built up. So cross over this. And we've gone really quite rural and now we're straight back into Solihull. Built barriers. There's a couple of new housing estates just up there. Schools. You know we're fully back into built up town area now. This is the Land Rover plant. It's massive. It's miles and miles long. If you've seen a Land Rover any of the modern or the old Land Rovers. Pretty much area in the world. Chances are it was probably built here and shipped over which is really cool. So again in our little town of 250,000 people we've got this giant manufacturing plant right next to farms and cows and rural and all sorts. We've got an airport which is mad. It's called Birmingham Airport but it's technically in Solihull. So yeah there you go. This is my hometown. Anyway looks like it might rain soon so we need to get back on the bike and get back home. So I'll see you there. Finished on the bike. Went home. Had a shower. Met up with this one here. This is Becky my wife. Still sounds weird. So we're now officially back in Solihull. So all of the Solihull that you saw earlier. We're back again. We decided to walk in. How far is it? Two miles. Yeah so we've had a bit of a stroll. We're back in. Get some food and hopefully a beer. Really want a beer. Now that everything's starting to open again we should hopefully be able to get a brew. What are you going to have? Everything. What are pizza dumplings? Handmade dumplings. Stuffed with pizza toppings. The Nutella one. Is it a dessert one of a kind? Well yeah. I reckon Nutella and banana might be a good dessert. Shut up. There's no meat? This is a lid. I'm sorry. It's hammering it now. I'm properly hammering it now. We've got a two mile walk to get home. Welcome to the great British summer. We've got a beer though so it's not all of that. So we've gone from just lots and lots of rain. There's lots of rain, thunder, lightning and a rainbow. We're a bit scared really. What? Lightning. You
