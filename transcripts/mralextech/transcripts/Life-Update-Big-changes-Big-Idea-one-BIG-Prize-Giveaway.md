Hey, what's going on folks? So you OG Mistralix tech subscribers will remember the times when I used to creep around the woods looking like a bit of a pervert. I haven't done one of those videos in a while so I figured I'd come out today. I've actually got a really busy day. I've got things on but I had a few spare hours and they decided to get out of the house because it's a really nice day and I figured I'd do a bit of an update because there are some things going on which I haven't told you guys about. I wanted to come in, fill you in, say a quick thank you to everyone that's subscribed and is sticking around and supporting the channel and all that sort of thing. Stretch my legs, get some air. So here we are. I'm also filming on a wildly inappropriate lens to be doing this sort of thing. It's a 100mm SURE anamorphic lens. So this might be wildly out of focus but we shall see. OK, this bench isn't actually that much of a bench. But never mind. So yeah, I think it's been. It's been well over a year since I did one of these update-y style videos. I think it was when I went full time. I've been doing this full time YouTube thing for quite some time now. Haven't done an update video so here we are. And the first thing we want to say, first of all, is thanks. Thanks to everyone. I always say this when I do these sorts of things. Thanks to everyone that's been following along. Thank you to everyone that shares the videos, likes the videos, comments on the videos, whether it be good or bad. I don't mind a bit of abuse every now and again. It's all good. It's part of life on YouTube and especially everyone that's been supporting the magic plugins, magic anime and magic zoom. Obviously, that's massive for me. It's really been helping out with kind of the transition to go in full time and keeping me ticking over and all of that sort of thing. So yeah, it's all good. So thank you all very, very much. Indeed, this is all unscripted, by the way. So if it sounds nothing like my tutorials, because it's just mostly waffle and me saying, um, yeah. And so that would be why. But let's go find somewhere else to go and set up a fancy shop for no reason whatsoever. Tree for focus. Focus on the tree. Stand next to the tree. Camera conspiracies is going to have an absolute field day with this video. Not that I don't think you watch this, but if you did. It would be taking the piss, which is fair. So anyway, first thing Friday, this Friday, we're going to be doing a live stream. I did a live stream the other week and people seem to enjoy it. So we're going to do another one. So please do join in if you fancy some more live shenanigans. And we've got a special guest. Mr. Darren Mustard is going to be joining us and he's going to be giving away a big prize. Hmm. So if you fancy winning a big prize, do join in. Darren is going to be running his online colorist masterclass. So it's a four day masterclass with Darren, where he shows all of his secrets to grading professional projects, running it as a business, all of the inside stuff, and he's giving away a ticket. So it's worth about £500. I was on his live stream the other day and I offered to buy one of his subscribers a ticket. So he's coming on to my live stream and he's going to be buying one of my subscribers, one of you lucky luck, a ticket to his masterclass. Now this was completely on prompt to I randomly just thought this is a really nice thing to do. So he messaged me today and said, you fancy doing a live stream and I'll give away a ticket to one of your subscribers as well. So that's what we're doing. So if you fancy that, join in. I'll leave you some instructions down in the comments below. So check the comments, check the link down there somewhere, find the live stream, come along, potentially win a ticket to a masterclass. Yeah. I'm in the center of the frame this time. I bet you thought I was going to be over there. No, in the middle. So the next thing I want to talk about real quick is this idea. I should have really scripted this bit because I don't really know how to explain it, but let's not go into all the details. I just want to throw out a question, essentially, and I want to get some feelers and I want your feedback and opinion. So do let me know down in the comments section below. But essentially it's this. I know DaVinci Resolve relatively well now. I've been doing this for a while. What I lack is experience because I've never put myself forward as like a real world professional editor because I'm in that rock and a hard place situation where I know I kind of know what I'm doing, but I don't feel confident enough because I lack the experience to put myself forward in that professional capacity and charge for it and all that sort of thing. So if that's you, if you feel very similar, stick around for a second. Alternatively, if you just want to get stuck into more editing, but you don't have the footage to play with, and that's really where your stumbling block is. Again, this might be for you. So what am I talking about? I'm thinking about starting a subscription kind of thing. Now it is going to be subscription. It's not going to be the cheapest thing in the world. I'll let you know that straight away. But the idea is essentially if we get a bunch of us together, we all chip in a certain amount per month and we pay to go and have real world shoots done. So we essentially crowdfund a videographer to go and shoot something with a caveat that all of us in the group get the files. So we'll get real world experience. We get a brief and then we get a videographer to go out and shoot the thing. The business or whoever it may be that we're shooting for gets a free video. So they win the videographer. They get paid, which is always good. It helps the whole kind of circle of life thing. The videographer gets paid. We get all of these project files to mess around with and to do a real world edit. You can use it in your show real. You get real world experience and you're in a collective group of people all going through the same thing. So you can all sort of chat and ask each other questions and give each other ideas. It becomes a bit of a community that's all kind of held together by yours truly. Mr. Alex Tech, me. And then we'll also if we get stuck, we'll get some professionals in. We can speak to Darren, for example, and go, we're trying to grade this. What would you do? And he can come in and do a bit of a live stream. So it's kind of like a. It's like I'm going to call it like an academy kind of thing. You sign up, you join, you become part of this community where you can all chat and mingle with each other, bounce off each other, learn from each other. But you've also got some real world projects to edit. That's the idea. That's all it is at the minute is an idea. So I want to know what you think. If that sounds like something you might be interested in, let me know. As mentioned, it would be a subscription. It wouldn't be like a $3 thing. It would be a 30, 40, 50, $60 thing a month because paying for it, getting all the storage, hosting it, bandwidth, all that sort of thing. It's not going to be the cheapest thing in the world. So, but if that sounds cool, please do let me know. Pretending to walk into frame that the camera wasn't set up. But I didn't just walk over there to then walk back. Last update. Next thing I wanted to talk about. Vlogs, man. They're not my thing, generally, but I'm trying. Leave me alone. Again, abuse of the comments if you want to. So the next big thing anyway is I'm getting an office. So we are finally moving out of the little spare room in my house, which is where I've been making all my YouTube videos for the past however many years, a long time now, and we've officially got an office. So we're getting a decent sized office space where we can set things up. I will do all my editing from there. I'll do all the boring stuff from there and we'll set up some dedicated filming spaces so that I can film my talking head videos and we'll make some spaces to do some other sorts of videos as well. Part of the problem I have at home is if I want to film anything, I have to kind of rearrange the entire room every time it's a bit of a nightmare. In a dedicated space, I'll have loads more space. So it's kind of taking everything, all this stuff I've been doing full time for a while, just kind of knocking it up a notch, really, going to the next level of things. And I'm really excited about it. It wasn't something I ever kind of planned to do. Something I always wanted, but it didn't necessarily make sense. But me and Becky, my wife are looking to move house this year. So then there'd be a massive period where I wouldn't be able to make my videos, you know, as we were taking the room down and searching for a new house and then moving in and then having to decorate, blah, blah, blah. By doing this, I'll have a fixed place so I can continue working, continue making Mr. Alex Tech videos and just doing all of that fun stuff. So it's really exciting time. Let's go on the right this time. So that's it, really. That's the update. I'm super chilled video. Just wanted to come out and talk to you guys, give you a bit of an update and let you know what's going on with me, basically. So let me know your thoughts, feelings, comments, all of that stuff down below. Always interested to hear from you. And let me know your feedback. Anything you'd like to see on the channel as well. I'm always ears, so do let me know. Thanks for watching. Join us on Friday for the live stream. Take it easy. See ya.
