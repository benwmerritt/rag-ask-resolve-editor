## Transcript
What up folks, it's Alex here. Welcome to Five Minute Friday, and today we're gonna talk about the ever-popular 18 by 9 or 2 by 1 aspect ratio. Now this video has been edited and exported in 18 by 9. You're watching on a modern phone, which a lot of you do, you'll notice that this video fully fills your screen. That's because modern phones nowadays, especially flagship or big ones like this, is the Pixel 2 XL, they all have the 18 by 9 aspect ratio. Now this is a great tip, it's something really useful to know, but you need to keep your viewers in mind. I generally export my videos at 16 by 9, and that's because only about 30% of my audience actually watch on the mobile phone. Because I do tutorials, most people sit down and watch them on their PC. However, if you do a lot of vlogs, you're probably gonna have a higher percentage of people watching on their phone, then this is definitely something you may want to consider. Now something else to bear in mind is because cameras all record at 16 by 9, you're gonna have to crop some of the bottom and the top of your video in order to get it to work. Make sure you leave enough room. Now up here, you'll see four common resolutions you'll use to get that 18 by 9 aspect ratio. There's two for 1080p and two for 4K. Now there are two options for each, because you have a choice, you can either upscale or stretch your footage to that little bit, or you can just bring it down and downscale. Honestly, for YouTube, it doesn't really make that much of a difference. My preferred method, filming 4K, take it down to the 2,880 by 1440, which is what you're watching now, because it looks really good. But if you can only film at 1080p, don't be afraid to upscale that 2160 by 1080, because it'll still look great, especially on YouTube. Right, anyway, with all that out of the way, let's boot up the DaVinci Resolve. Now we'll have a look. So here we are, folks, we're in the DaVinci Resolve and we're on the Edit tab. Now this is a nice, quick, easy one. We just need to open up our project settings, which you do so by clicking on this cog down in the bottom right-hand corner. Then we need to go to the Master settings, so select Master settings from the left, and you should see this screen. Now in this timeline format box at the top, you'll see the timeline resolution, and you're probably set to the same as me, 1920 by 1080. If you click on the dropdown, you'll see a selection of standard resolutions like so. But what's not immediately clear is if you scroll right to the top, you've got an option to select Custom. Give that a click, and then in these two boxes here, is where you can type your custom resolution. Now if you've shot at 1080p and you don't want to upscale anything, you want to actually just bring the resolution down, leave it as 1920, and then change the 1080 to 960. 960 is half of 1920, so that'll give you the two by one or 18 by nine aspect ratio. If you don't mind upscaling a little bit, change that to 2160 by 1080. If you shot up 4K, a really nice one to use is 2880 by 1440, and that's actually what this video has been produced at. Wouldn't you happy? You've set that custom resolution, simply click on Save, and it'll be taken back to this screen. Now it does look any different at the moment because we've got nothing in the preview window, but if I just import some media, this clip will shot up 4K, and it's in the standard 16 by nine aspect ratio. And that's why, usually when I put this on the timeline, it would fill the preview completely. But because we're at this wider aspect ratio, we've got these black bars on the left and right hand side. So all we need to do is zoom in so that our image fits the entire preview window, and there's a few ways you can do that. Click the link above if you don't know how to transform. There's a video where I'll show you this in more detail, but simply open your inspector, go to transform, and then you've got the option here to zoom. So I'm just gonna zoom in. It's about there. And then I can also reposition it on the X or Y axis. Alternatively, click on this little icon here, and I bring the box up and you can just drag it, move it, resize it, do whatever you need to do. Wouldn't you happy? Edit your video as you usually would. Head to deliver, and you'll notice straight away it's pulled through the custom resolution into the resolution box. Then you can just enter your export settings as normal with that custom resolution, and it'll export at the resolution that you've set it. Now, another quick tip before we go, go back into the cog, head to presets, and you've got a list of presets here. Let's say, for example, I don't wanna have to set this to 280 by 1440 every time. I do this quite often. I can head to this preset screen. Got the current project selected. I can see to 80 by 1440. I'll hit save. Put this as 4K, 18 by nine. Okay, that. And that becomes a preset. So now whenever I open DaVinci Resolve, I can go to my project settings, presets, 4K, 18 by nine, and then load it in. Now, alternatively, if you only edit and you only have a shoot with this aspect ratio in mind, you can right click, and then you should save it as the user default config. So whenever you open DaVinci Resolve, that's the aspect ratio that will automatically be used. And that's it, folks. Easy as that. Hope you enjoyed this video.
