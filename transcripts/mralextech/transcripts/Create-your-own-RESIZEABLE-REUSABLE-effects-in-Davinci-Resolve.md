Check out this crazy looking expression. I'm going to show you how to use it from start to finish to create your own scalable, resizable animation effects which sit on your edit page and you can just drop onto whatever you like. Now, there's loads of different uses for this, but the example we're going to use is this. Now, you may have seen this in my magic animation tool, and this is actually the secret source that makes all of that work. If you did miss my magic animation tool, click up here to go check it out. And talking of secret source, this video is sponsored by Squarespace, but more on those in a short while. Now, for this video, I'm not actually going to explain in detail what that expression does or how it works, because that kind of needs its own video, but instead, I'm just going to show you how to use it, how to combine it with the anim curves to create these reusable effects. Now, you don't need to remember it. The expression plus another one is down in the description below. Now, this will work under which resolve 17, to which resolve 18, as well as the free and studio versions. So, let's open it up and take a look. So, here we are on the edit page of the virtual resolve. Now, all you need to do, grab a PNG, if you want to follow along, drop it on your timeline like so. So, I'm just going to use this logo, and then we're going to right click, and we're going to open in the Fusion page. Now, for this one, we're just going to do that zoom effect. So, all we need is our transform node. So, make sure you've got your nodes open down here. If you don't see those, just click on nodes up here in the top left to open those up. From this little menu bar right in the middle, you want this one. This is your transform node. Just drag that onto your line and release so it's in there like so. Give it a click in the inspector. You've got all of your transform options within here. Now, you can actually apply the same thing to anything as mentioned, but we're just going to stick with the size attribute for this video. So, size obviously makes this smaller and bigger like so. Now, this is where we start to use our anim curves. So, what we need to do, simply right click on the word size, go to modify width, and then the top option is anim curves. Give that a click, and by default, what this will simply do is go from zero to five. So, as you can see, size at the very end of our clip is at five, whereas the very beginning, it's at zero, and if we hit play, it's just going to animate through like so. Now, if you stick on the Fusion page, I'm just going to hop onto the edit page as second for a quick demo. You'll notice that this is always going zero to five, and if I make this longer, it's still going to go zero to five. This is the joy of anim curves. It'll just rescale it so no matter how long your composition is, the actual animation will be the same. It'll always go from zero to five. This is why anim curves are so cool. So, let me hop back into the Fusion page to modify the anim curves, which we obviously need to do. In the inspector, the very top, you've got modifiers. Give that a click. And then you've got these anim curves on transform one. Now, for this video, we're not going to go through every single thing within the anim curves. I have talked about anim curves in slightly more detail in the past when I actually made a transitions video showing you how to use anim curves for that. That's linked up above and down in the description if you want to go check that one out. But we're going to stick with the core stuff, the core stuff that you need to really make this process work. Now, you want to start off in the middle here where you've got scaling and you've got scale and it says five at the moment. Now, what this is doing is telling the anim curves how much you want the attribute to be changed. So, if we were to change this to two, animation would now simply go from zero to two. So, this would get two times bigger, zero to two. We actually want this to be one because we want it to start at zero and then end at one. So, it basically goes from not existing and just flies in and then stops like so. Underneath that, you've got the offset. Now, the offset is worth knowing because what this does basically sets the start point. So, if I change offset to one, for example, it's now going to start at one and then end at what would be two. So, if we go back to tools, you can see size is two. It starts off at one because our offset is set to one and our scale is set to one. Combine them, you get two. For this example, we want zero and we want one. So, it just flies in like so. Now, we're not going to talk about the time scale or the clips because you're not going to use those for this example. Above that, you've got curve shape. Now, this is another reason why the anim curves are so cool. Now, this at the moment is just going from zero to one in a straight line. It's linear. So, there's no acceleration. It's just slowly coming in like so. There's no curve to the animation. Anim curves allow you to add curves. So, the curve option here is currently set to linear. If we just change the dropdown to easing, we then get these in and out options. Now, this one on the left, this refers to the first half of your animation. So, this bit essentially. And the second one, this one on the right over here, refers to the second half of your animation, the out. Now, what I recommend you do with these curves, just play with them. Five minutes, go through each one. Just have a little look. They're all the same thing. They're all just different curves. They just accelerate and slow down in different parts. As a rule of thumb, they get sort of more aggressive as you go further down the list. But yeah, have a play with them. See what works for you. I'm a sucker for just going to expo. It's quite a quick, aggressive one, but it kind of works. So, I'm just going to stick it on expo for this default. You can see it's quite quick in the middle, but then it has a really mellow sort of end to it. So, we're going to go with something like that. But as mentioned, feel free to have a play and see what works best for you. Now, the last thing I need to show you here before we have a look at this expression is this mirror tick box. If I give that a tick, what it's going to do, rather than going from zero to one, as it was before, it's going to go from zero to one right in the middle, and then it's going to go from one back to zero. We've just mirrored the entire thing. But rather than just mirroring it, we've actually sort of condensed it. So, as you can see, the animation is much quicker because it's only needing to go to one in the middle, rather than going to one at the end. And if we hit play, it's just going to pop in, and then pop straight back out. Now, again, because it's an anim curve, we could make this as long or as short as we like, and it's just going to fly in and then fly straight back out, which, if that's what you want, that's a really nice, simple way of doing that, pop in and pop out animation. But we want ads to actually pop in in the first sort of second, then hold itself and then pop out at the end. So, we need to start customizing it just a little bit more. I'm going to jump back onto the Fusion page right here. So, this is now when we start to use our expression. A real quick message from this video sponsor, Squarespace.

As mentioned, the expression is down below. We're just going to copy and paste it for now. If you want to know more, you want me to do a really nerdy video where we probably geek out about expressions. Let me know because I'd quite happily do that and bore you to death with it. But let me just copy and paste it now and show you how it works. Now, at the very top here, we've got source and it currently says transition because that's the default. We want to change that to custom. And then we get this little input box underneath. Now, if I move from play here, you'll see that actually nothing is happening. Now we've got no animation and that's because the animation is controlled by this input. So this basically controls the anim curve. So you can see I'm moving that and our animation is playing through. Now this simply runs from a zero to one scale. So the animation will be complete at one and it will be nothing at zero. Now we can control this with an expression, which is where our expression comes in. So I'm going to right click on input and then go to expression and then I'm just going to paste my expression within there. Now, if we simply hit play, it's going to animate in. It's going to hold all the way and then right towards the end, it's going to animate out like so. Bing. Now we can go to edit and we can make this as long or as short as we like. The in animation will always take one second and the out will always take one second. So we've created this reusable, completely scalable effect really quickly and easily. You can knock this up really fast when you've got that expression to hand. And that's it. Pretty much done. You could then save that, import it into DaVinci Resolve and use it as a reusable effect, which I am going to show you how to do in a moment. But if you want to be able to adjust the speed, there's a trick to be able to do that and give you a little slider as well. So I'm going to show you that if you're not bothered about the speed, you're happy for it always just to be one second in and one second out. Then just skip ahead to the macro section that should be listed in the chapters below. But if you want to be able to control the speed, stick around. Now, as mentioned, I'm not getting into the expression all that much, but you do need to know this. Now, within this expression, you can see there's two points where we do a divided by two. That's really key. Dividing it by two, ignoring all the masks for now, basically makes the whole animation last for one second. Now we can actually make that a variable so that you can adjust that divided by, so be whatever you want, which allows you to adjust the length of the animation. Sounds really fancy. Sounds complicated. It's actually relatively easy to set up. You can either change the expression manually, which I'll do as we go, or you can simply copy the other expression that's listed down below and use that one instead. So let's take a look at that. So what we want is one of these, one of these little wheels, which allows us to scrub back and forth and changes the speed of our animation. And to do that, we're going to use what's called a custom control. So we're going to come on down to our transform down here on our nodes. We're going to right click and we're going to go to this option here, Edit controls. And this Edit control box will appear. Now, this is a bit of a nightmare, honestly, to learn. So we're just going to skip through it with the basics. In the name, we're going to put AnimSpeed with a capital A and a capital S. We're essentially just naming our control here. Now, it does need to be case sensitive. So make sure you put your capital A and your capital S. We can skip ID, come on down to type. We're going to click number and then page. Page just refers to the little tabs where it's going to appear. So we want this to be on the controls tab. And then we come over to the right and we've got these options. These little scrolly wheels are called screw controls. So we're just going to use input control, screw control, and then we can leave view control and these as it is. The only last thing you want to do in the default, simply put the number two in there because that's what we want our default to be. And then simply click on OK. Now, if we were to shoot back to our tools, we now have this AnimSpeed control at the bottom. We can just scroll it up and down. So this is what we're going to use to control our animation. So all we now need to do is to change our expression rather than having a two in it, just to refer to this AnimSpeed. So we're going to go to modifiers. In that input, we're just going to scroll through. To find our divided by two. So I'm going to delete my number two and then we're just going to refer it back to that AnimSpeed. So all you need to do, you type in the name of the node. So the node here is called transform one with the capital T. So we've got transform one dot anim speed. So the node name dot then the control name. We're going to go to our other number two, delete that. Transform one dot anim speed. And we're done. If we hit play one second, one second, if we go to our tools now, we've got this anim speed. If we increase that, it actually means that animation is going to be slower. It's going to take longer. So we hit play. And now we've got much slower animation. If we bring this down a bit, we've got a much quicker animation. And then in the modifiers, we can still go and change the animation curve to be whatever we want it to be. We still have complete control over the scale and everything else, but we can now have an additional control to control the speed. I know that probably looks really complicated and fiddly, but once you get used to it, once you just get used to copying that expression in, if you want to do just the one second one, use the divided by two one, or you want to use the other one, add your control anim speed. And then you've got that speed control as well. It's actually relatively quick to do. And then you can save it as a preset. So it always sits on your edit page. You actually only need to do this once to create everything and then you're good to go. So how then do you save this as a macro so it's accessible all the time whenever you want it? Well, let me show you that. So all you need to do on your nose down here, simply right click, go to macro, and then we're going to create a macro. And this macro editor window will appear. Now, the very first thing you need to do at the top here, give it a name. This is a name as it will appear once you're back on the edit page. So I'm just going to go with something like zoomie. Now you can say I've got transform one here. This is referring to our transform one node. And then down here we've got our anim curves. Now for each of these, all you need to do is to open them up and then you tick the boxes of the things that you want access to once you're back editing on the edit page. So you can see here, I've got center, pivot, size, and this tallies with all of our controls that are in the inspector. So I'm going to want access to the center to pivot. I'm not bothered about the size because that's going to be easy to access once you're actually on the edit page. So I'm going to take aspect and then probably angle and let's take the flips as well. Why not if you've made the anim speed, you're going to want to take that, which is right at the bottom as well. Now we do want some of our controls from our anim curve. So I'm going to expand anim curves. We've got controls here and I've got all of these options within here. Again, you can move around still with this box open. So I'm just going to go to my modifier. So we're going to have a quick look source. Don't need that input. Don't need that curves. I do want to get a tick that in and out out lookup. That gives us that custom graph. So we're going to take that one mirror, invert, scale and offset. Now you can take as many as you want, but I think that should give us all the controls that we're going to need. When you happy, simply click on file at the top and then save as now when the little window appears, all you need to do is to find a location on your PC. That's really easy to access. So I've simply created a new folder on my desktop and I'm going to create and save this zoomie dot setting. So I'm just simply going to hit save right here. Now it doesn't matter as I say where it is. It just needs to be easily accessible because we now just need to reimport that back into DaVinci Resolve. So to do that, we're just going to close this macro editor. We're simply going to go to the effects library still on fusion, expand templates, expand edit and then click on effects. And that'll give you your full list of all of your effects within here. Now open up that folder outside of DaVinci Resolve. So I've got my folder right here just in a Windows Explorer and I've got my zoomie dot setting. What we're going to do, click, hold drag and we're just going to drop it on this list here. DaVinci Resolve will have a quick think and then I'm going to scroll right to the bottom until you get to this effects category. And within there, we should now see a zoomie, which we do. Now you shouldn't need to restart DaVinci Resolve. Sometimes you may have to special and older versions, but hopefully that's come straight through. So now we can go back to the edit page and take a look at it. So back on the edit page, I'm just going to delete this one off my timeline and we'll start completely from scratch. Bring a new PNG down in my effects library. We're going to open up effects within the fusion effects area, which should be near the top. You should have your new effect within there. So I've got my zoomie. We're just going to drop it onto this PNG, hit play, and it's going to pop in and pop out. And we can make this as long or as short as we need it to be. If I give it a click in the inspector, we're going to go to effects and I've got all of my controls within there. So everything that we ticked so I can move the center, the pivot, the aspect, the angle to get it looking exactly as we want it. If we want to adjust the size, we actually just use the scale. We can adjust the anim speed if you want, and we can even change the easing so we can go to a different curve or even create our own using custom and then using the custom lookup. I'm going to leave it as easing. Just hit play and boom. There we are. Job done. Easy as you like. Tada. That's it. Hopefully that made sense. It's a great technique you can actually use to create loads of other stuff. If you want to see me create more stuff with this, you want more ideas, let me know down in the comment section below. Thanks for watching. Take it easy. I'll see you next time.
