This is the brand new Asus ZenBook S16. It's thin, it's lightweight, it's got a lovely 16 inch OLED display, it's rocking the latest AMD StrixPoint APU and a dedicated NPU for some AI goodness. And I'm Alex, DaVinci Resolve and technology YouTuber who is neither thin nor lightweight, really. Thanks to Asus for partnering with me to bring you this sponsored first look at the Asus ZenBook S16. Now this one I've got here is actually an early engineering sample. So some minor things, visual things may change when it actually makes it to its proper release. Now this funky looking thing was announced at the recent Compitex Taipei Expo alongside some more creator focused pro art laptops. There's the traditional 16 inch workhorse pro art P16, the foldable 13 inch pro art PX13 for creating on the move. And the one that really caught my eye, the 13 inch creator focused tablet pro art PZ13, running the Snapdragon Elite, which I was briefly allowed to look at but wasn't allowed to turn on or really play with much at all. But I should be getting my hands on all of those in the very near future. So make sure to subscribe for those. But for now, we're gonna talk about this one. And let's kick things off talking about the design because it is pretty unique. I actually really liked the way it looks. It's got a proper matte finish to it, which I think looks pretty cool. And it's really, really great at hiding fingerprints and smudges. Asus calls it seroluminum. It's an aluminium seromization process through plasma electrolytic oxidation. Which sounds well fancy. And I have no idea what it means. But Asus describe it as being lightweight, enduring, everlasting and unique. Combined with the chrome etching, showing the usual Asus geometric shapes, it gives it this really professional, modern interior design kind of look, which I really like. Time will tell if it's actually as hard-lasting as they say, but it does make for a pretty striking, pretty unique looking laptop. Now it's available in two colors. You've got this one, which is the Zumaia gray. And then you've got a white one, which is Scandinavian white. As mentioned, this is that ultra portable, ultra lightweight kind of range. And it is, wow, it's lightweight and it's thin. It weighs in at just 1.5 kilos and it's thin at 1.1 centimetres. And despite it's super lightweight, super thin chassis, they've actually not skimped out on ports. We've got one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port, two USB 4 Type-C ports, a HDMI 2.1 port, a full-size SD card reader, hooray and an audio combo jack. Now because they can't actually squeeze an ethernet port onto this device, it would make it thicker. They actually include a Type-A ethernet adapter in the box as well, which is pretty handy. Now talking of those two Type-C ports, they're both capable of up to 40 gigabits of transfer speeds and of course, power deliveries. The included charger is Type-C. And of course you can use any of your existing Type-C chargers as well. Oh, and before I forget, it's Wi-Fi 7 certified. Pop it open and on the inside, the screen in typical ASUS fashion is a lovely, vibrant, colour-accurate HDR Lumina OLED panel. This one is 16 inches, 16 by 10, 3K and 120 hertz. It's touchscreen too, and of course works with the ASUS pen 2.0. Now fitting that 16 inch display into an ultra portable like this, does result in some teeny tiny bezels and a 90% screen to body ratio. Yes, they have still managed to squeeze in the AISense IR webcam, which is good for some 1080p video calls, and of course, Windows Hello. Audio on the other hand is provided by Harman Kardon. There are six speakers in total, four subs, two tweeters, and it does indeed feature Dolby Atmos. Next up, the keyboard, which is a fairly standard Chick-Lit style affair with a nice layout. There's ample backlighting, there's plenty of travel, and there's minimal flex. There is also a new shortcut key down here on the bottom right, which you're going to start to see a lot of on Windows devices in the future. We'll talk about that a little bit more in a moment. Underneath that is this giant 16 by 10 touchpad. There's multi-touch and it has some smart gestures. So you can actually scroll the right-hand side to adjust the brightness, scroll up and down on the left-hand side to adjust the volume, and scroll across the top to scrub backwards and forwards through video, which is pretty handy actually. But what's inside? Because it's what's inside that matters, at least that's what my mother tells me. Well, this one is powered by the latest AMD StrixPoint APU with its 12-core Zen 5 architecture, featuring the latest RDNA 3.5 GPU cores in the integrated AMD graphics and a TDP of 28 watts. And all of that is combined with up to 32 gigabytes of LPDDR5X memory and up to two terabytes of NVMe SSD storage. And while I'm not allowed to benchmark it, so I can't give you any facts and figures, what I can tell you is that it feels nice and zippy and quick in day-to-day use, doing the kind of tasks you would do on an ultrabook like this. Browsing the web with tons of tabs open, messing around in Photoshop, and even surprisingly, whipping around in a basic timeline in DaVinci Resolve, everything feels quick, snappy, and nice to use. Hopefully in the future, when it's properly released, I'll get another one to hand. We can do some testing and we can do some benchmarks in a proper full review. Now, as mentioned, this is one of the new generation of Windows laptops, which is running with integrated AI. This latest AMD Ryzen APU comes with a dedicated NPU. And these third generation AMD Ryzen AI CPUs with that NPU are capable of 50 tops of AI performance. But none of that really means anything unless we have an idea of what an NPU is designed to do. Essentially, it's just there to help accelerate artificial intelligence and machine learning tasks, which means you can take these generally cloud-based AI features and run them locally instead, which means more speed, more availability, less latency, and more security. There are things like AI adaptive dimming and adaptive lock, which will dim the screen and lock the device automatically when you leave your desk, which makes sure that no little spies can come in and get access to all of your juicy little details. There's Microsoft Copilot integrated, so that's gonna run locally at some point in the future. So think chat GPT, but running locally instead of having to fetch it over the internet, which also explains why there is now that dedicated Copilot key. AI image and video generation, again locally, and real-time captions. Now this one I can show you. So this will generate captions in real-time, either using the content you're watching on screen or using the microphone to caption everything that's happening around you, which is pretty cool. Plus, it will help to accelerate AI enhanced features within your favorite software like DaVinci Resolve. So they'll be able to use that MPU to accelerate things like magic masks, speed warps, super scaling, transcriptions, and all that other fun stuff. And on top of all that AI goodness, they've also added some additional security and privacy with Microsoft Pluton encryption and core isolation to help you keep your secrets secret. For calling, we've got buy layer graphite sheets, dual fans with a vapor chamber, and loads of these teeny tiny little vent holes in this snazzy looking grill design, which all should combine to help keep this thing cool and quiet. ASUS are actually reporting up to 50% increased performance in its low power whisper mode compared to the previous gen ZenBook S13. And keeping this whole thing running is a sizeable 78 watt hour battery, reportedly capable of running this thing for up to 12 hours. And that just about covers everything in this first look at the brand spanking new ASUS ZenBook S16. Let me know your thoughts and feedback down in the comments below. Thanks ever so much for watching. Take it easy. I'll see you next time.
