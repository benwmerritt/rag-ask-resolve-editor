What up folks, it's Ali's here. So you've been using your camera for a little while now and you feel like you've sort of outgrown the kit lens So it's time for an upgrade, but you've never really been lens shopping before So all these weird stupid acronyms don't really make much sense and your little bit is Confused as to what you should be looking for. Well in this video We're going to go through some of the key things you need to look out for when upgrading from the kit lens So let's crack on shall we? Now as obvious as this may sound the first thing you need to do is to make sure you know which lens mount you're looking for Now whether your camera is a Sony a Canon or a Nikon You need to know whether you're shooting with a crop sensor camera or a full frame camera If you're unsure just put your camera model name into Google and it should be relatively easy to find out whether it's a crop sensor camera or some known as APS-C Sensor camera or a full frame camera the reason you need to do this is because there are different lenses for full frame cameras and For crop sensor cameras now a full frame lens will fit on both a full frame camera and a crop sensor camera However a crop sensor lens will fit on a crop sensor camera But won't necessarily fit on a full frame camera So you don't want to end up buying a lens which doesn't fit if you're shooting on a Canon crop Sensor camera you need to look out for lenses that are marked either EF or EF-S EFS means it's a crop sensor lens If you've got a full frame Canon then you need to make sure that you're just looking for EF lenses because the EFS Lenses won't fit the same applies for Nikon, but the Nikon crop sensor lenses are labeled DX the Sony crop sensor lenses are marked E mount while the full frame Lenses are marked FE so full frame E mount If you're looking at picking up a third-party lens i.e a Sigma or a Tamron They need to know that the Sigma crop sensor lenses are marked DC and the Tamron crop sensor lenses are marked DI2 So I've got a few examples here. Here's a Tamron full frame lens It's marked DI we know that's a full frame lens So it'll work on a full frame or crop sensor cameras if it was a DI2 it would only work on crop sensor cameras This is a Sony zoom lens. It's marked FE so we know this is a full frame lens So it'll work on both a full frame Sony camera as well as an APS-C sensor camera This is a Sigma DC lens the DC means that it's made for crop sensor cameras and not full frame cameras Once you know the lens mount you're looking for you then need to figure out which focal length you want Now the focal length is one of the most important aspects of any lens Because the focal length dictates the field of view that you'll actually see when you're taking your images So the lower the focal length numerically i.e an 8mm or a 12mm or a 16mm The wider the lens will be the more things will be in the shot As the number increases say a 35mm or a 55mm it'll be a little bit more zoomed in And then at the longer end they really tell a photo that the really zoomed in lens are things like 200 and 300mm So you need to decide on which sort of focal length you want Something else really important to remember is that crop sensor cameras actually have something that's called the crop factor What that means is crop sensor cameras are actually More zoomed in by default than that full frame equivalent So for example if you take a 30mm lens and put it on a full frame camera You have a field of view that is equivalent to 30mm Now if you put that exact same lens on a crop sensor camera The field of view will be slightly more zoomed in and it'll be more equivalent to 45mm Canon crop sensor cameras have a crop factor of 1.6 Nikon's is 1.5 and Sony is 1.5 So you have to take 30mm and times it by 1.5 which is 45mm You just need to be aware that all the lenses will actually be more zoomed in If you put them on a crop factor camera then you're well on a full frame camera Now again, this sounds really obvious But you need to decide on what you want to be shooting With your new lens if you have an interest in landscapes Then there's no point in looking for a really zoomed in lens Because it won't do landscapes particularly well On the flip side to that if you want to shoot loads of sports Then there's no point looking at a really wide lens You want a telephoto lens because you'll be further away from your subject So you need to be able to zoom in and capture the action So make sure you know in your head the purpose for buying this lens Don't be wrong. I love buying lenses. I love buying camera equipment But you need to know the reason you're buying it before you actually go out and buy it Otherwise you'll just make a silly decision and regret your purchase So the Tamron This is a 35mm It says on the box 35mm. That's your focal length This lens 16mm This one here is a 70 to 200mm Now what that means is this is a zoom lens The other two lenses were prime lenses What does prime lens mean? A prime lens is a lens that doesn't zoom It has a constant focal length The only way to zoom in on your subject is to walk towards them yourself You have to get closer to your subject because you physically can't zoom in with your lens If you see a variable focal length on the box i.e. 70-200mm or 18-55mm for example That means it's a zoom lens That means you can rotate the lens to zoom out Rotate it again to zoom in to get closer to your subject Zoom lenses are inherently more flexible than prime lenses Because you don't have to physically move to get closer to your subject You can just zoom in So they have more flexibility and they can be useful when you physically can't get closer to your subject If you're shooting wildlife for example You don't want to get in the lines then You get how much happier, stunninger you are and zooming in Prime lenses on the other hand are generally Generally a little bit sharper So you get slightly better image quality And they have wider maximum apertures So aperture, what is aperture for starters? Well aperture is the size of the hole The size of the opening within your lens A larger maximum aperture i.e. a smaller f number I'll show you that in a second Means more light is able to get into your camera A larger aperture means that the lens is better in low light conditions And it also means that you get more of that Boca, and what I mean by Boca is This out of focus blurry background So you can see the area behind me is all silky smooth and out of focus And that's because the lens I'm using is an f 1.4 lens So I've got it cranked I've put wide to f 1.4 to give me that silky smooth background The aperture is marked on the lens with an f number So this is an f 4 lens This is a 70 to 200mm zoom lens f 4 So this the widest this lens can go at any given point is an f 4 You can always stop it down so you can stop it to an f 5.6 or an f 8 But the widest you can get this lens to go is an f 4 These two lenses these two prime lenses are considerably faster This lens is an f 1.8 While this lens which is the lens I'm actually shooting on at the moment Is an f 1.4 Both lenses let in about four times more light Than the f 4 at the widest aperture This means that you can have a faster shutter speed in low light conditions Now generally speaking the wider the aperture the lower the f number The bigger and heavier the lens will actually be Because to have a bigger opening the lens has to be physically bigger Which means there has to be physically more glass in there Which is always going to increase the weight of the lens for example Now we've got the fact that these are different mounts One's a mirrorless and one's a digital SLR lens This tiny little lens here is a 35mm This lens is considerably bigger considerably heavier This is also a 35mm they have the exact same focal length However this is an f 2.8 this is an f 1.8 And if we look at the front element the size difference is significant The weight is significant and the physical attributes of both lenses are very very different So the faster the aperture the bigger and heavier the lens is going to be You need to decide whether you want the flexibility of a zoom Or the fast maximum aperture of a prime lens Next is this one OSS or bear with me Maybe it's called VC is it OSS is it VC maybe it's called IS or it could be VR who knows What all these acronyms actually mean is image stabilization So some lenses have what's called image stabilization where there's others don't Image stabilization means that the lens will actually work with you to help stabilize your image Which will allow you to use a slightly slower shutter speed while still getting a sharp image Now Tamron's using acronym VC Nikon's using acronym VR Sony's is OSS and Canon is IS they all essentially do the same thing Lenses with image stabilization are probably going to be slightly bigger slightly heavier And slightly more expensive than the counterparts that don't have image stabilization I personally really like image stabilization It's very very useful especially if you're doing any low light shooting or if you're doing video Because it can help smooth out your video footage as well Again, this is a decision you need to make is image stabilization worth the extra money And last but not least we have this one USD on Canon. It's called USM on Sony It's called SSM and on Nikon. It's called AF-S What this all means is they use an ultrasonic type motor for the autofocus That means the autofocus should really simply be faster, more accurate and silent So some of the cheaper lenses will use ultrasonic motors and you'll actually hear them focusing Whereas a lens with an ultrasonic motor should be near silent and should be pretty accurate most of the time Again, those that use ultrasonic motors will be slightly more expensive So to recap, number one make sure you know the type of lens that you're looking for and the lens mount That's the most important thing because you don't want to get home with a brand new lens and realize it doesn't fit on your camera And then you need to decide whether you want a prime lens or a zoom lens and what focal length you want The next thing to think about is your maximum aperture. Are you happy shooting f2.8 or are there something really really wide like an f1.8 or a 1.4 Number four image stabilization. Do you need it or not? And then lastly ultrasonic motors Do you want slash need the fastest silent autofocus motors? If you're out doing landscapes, realistically, you probably don't. If you're at a wedding ceremony, you probably do And the last thing to mention is all brands will put random crap on there Which really you don't need to pay a huge amount of attention to. This one says sp That means special performance. This lens is labeled contemporary. This Sony lens is marked g For g-mouth stare doesn't actually make any difference to you Hopefully that information is useful and you guys can now go out there and find yourself a bloody awesome kit lens upgrade Don't forget to like and subscribe if this video is useful Hit the little bell if you want to see more and if there's anything else you want to know Please do pop a comment below and i'll see what i can do
