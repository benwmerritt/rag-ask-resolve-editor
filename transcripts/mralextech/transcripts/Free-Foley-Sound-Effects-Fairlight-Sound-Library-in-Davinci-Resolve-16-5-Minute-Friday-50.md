They sound a little something like this But what would you want to use those in your project Let's say you recorded a project in slow motion and you didn't record much audio You can use these sound effects to just add that audio back in and really build up the sound design So in this video, I'm going to show you where to download the pack how to install it and then how to access these sound effects within DaVinci resolve so let's get to it So first thing you need to do head over to this website here It's black magic design dot com forward slash support now There is a link down in the description below you can click that instead and then from this screen here If you scroll down you should see latest downloads and there's a list of all the latest downloads within there Scroll down depending on when you're viewing this the original version was released on the 6th of March 2020 There's the black magic fair light sounds library version 1.0 Available for Mac windows and Linux.

So we're just gonna click on next now. This is important This is asking you for the location for where you want the sound library to be installed It's gonna take about 1.5 gig initially and it may expand in the future So make sure you save it to a driver as plenty of space. We'll go next accept the license Next again, it's just gonna warn you that's gonna use 1.5 gigabyte of space and then install And when that's all done hop into DaVinci resolve now I'm on the edit tab at the moment. You can do this either within edit or within fairlight itself We're just gonna head up to the top here.
