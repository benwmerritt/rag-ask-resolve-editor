You know those tiny little gaps you get in between clips on your timeline, sometimes you miss them or you've just been making some changes and you get all those little spaces, you want to tidy them up really quickly, well there's a few ways you can do it in DaVinci Resolve. It's a fundamental skill you need to know but it's actually kind of easily missed. So give me a minute in your time and I'll show you the different ways that you can do it. So here we are in DaVinci Resolve and you can see I've got a couple of gaps on my timeline here in between these different clips. Now the first way, really simple one but sometimes it's missed, if you actually click on this empty space you can see it's highlighted like so. And then all you need to do is hit the ripple delete key. If you're on Windows that's the delete key and then if you're on Mac it's just the backspace key. So if we hit that, that will just delete that empty space bringing all of our clips together. Now that's great if you've just got one gap or a couple of gaps on your timeline but what you do when you've got a whole bunch of gaps and you want to close them all together, well that's easy too. All you need to do, shoot up to the very top where you've got edit, come right down and there's a button here that just says delete gaps. So we're going to give that a click and that's going to delete all of the gaps on our timeline bringing all of our clips together like so. So that's awesome but you have to go into edit. So is there an even quicker way? There is. Let me just undo that and then we're just going to click on the word DaVinci Resolve in the top left hand corner. We're going to go to keyboard customization. The keyboard customization window will appear. From the center list here you're going to go to application and then edit and then from this list on the right hand side just scroll down until you find delete gaps. I can see it right here. Now by default there isn't a keyboard shortcut assigned so we're just going to assign one. So what we need to do, click on this empty space here so it's highlighted in red and then you can assign a keyboard shortcut to delete gaps. Now I'm on Mac so I'm going to do command, shift and backspace. You can choose whatever you want, just pick something that's easy to remember and then we're going to hit save. It'll ask us to create a preset name. I'm just going to call this DaVinci Resolve 1 for now because I'm lazy and click on OK and then we can close this down. Now we've got these gaps on our timeline. If I just hit my command, shift and backspace it will delete all of those gaps and that's it. That's how you delete gaps quickly and easily in DaVinci Resolve.
