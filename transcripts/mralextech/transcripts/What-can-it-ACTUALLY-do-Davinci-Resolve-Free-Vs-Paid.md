Da Vinci Resolve, you've probably heard of it by now and you've probably heard that there's a free version and a paid version, but which version is right for you and is the free version even any good? Well let's find out, but before we do this is a Razer Blade 17 with an Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti laptop GPU. Now this was sent to me to play with by this video's sponsor Nvidia and Box.co.uk. Nvidia Studio is an initiative to use the RTX GPU to accelerate creative applications like Da Vinci Resolve and design laptops and desktop systems that expect to a creative professional's needs and Da Vinci Resolve uses that RTX GPU to deliver enhanced timeline performance, incredible GPU and AI based effects and improve rendering times and Box.co.uk have over one million customers, an excellent rating on trust pilots and 26 years of experience selling laptops, TVs, gaming PCs, components and now Nvidia Studio validated laptops. So head over to box.co.uk to browse that range of Nvidia Studio validated laptops plus you get free delivery on select products and the ability to select your own delivery window. Winner, first probably one of the most common questions is it really free? Yes it really is free, there isn't a catch, it's free, it's been free for a long time and I don't think that's going to change anytime soon. Yes it does need a relatively decent system to run well, if you're on windows you absolutely need a device with a dedicated graphics card. Ideally something powerful like that Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti but I actually ran Da Vinci Resolve for years on a 6 gig Nvidia GTX 1060 and honestly it ran okay, just adjust your expectations depending on your system. Now you can utilize that GPU when rendering your videos as hardware accelerated encoding is now included within the free version of Da Vinci Resolve. Now if that sounds like jargon to you basically graphics cards are really good at actually creating the video files so being able to use the GPU to deliver the video just means faster rendering but only one. The free version allows the use of just one GPU whereas the paid studio version allows for multiple GPUs. Now those graphics cards are also really good at unpacking video files also known as hardware accelerated decoding but unfortunately this is still limited to the paid studio version. This basically means that certain video files like the most common H.264 video files you're probably getting from your regular consumer level video camera digital SLR that sort of thing will run slower on the free version than on the paid version. For some that's reason enough to upgrade there's no limit on the free version you can use it as often and for as long as you want to. All of the future upgrades and updates are included up until now anyway I don't think they're going to change their mind they could but I don't think they will and resolve will alert you when there's an update so that you can go and download it and install it right away or you can ignore it it's totally up to you the old versions will continue to run and you can use it offline. The free version doesn't call back it's there's no always online DRM nonsense none of that you can just use it whenever and wherever you want to. Are there any watermarks? There are watermarks within DaVinci Resolve but only when you use hair. There are watermarks but only when you use studio only features but you'll know straight away as the watermark will appear on the edit page as soon as you drop anything on there which is limited to the studio version. You won't get stung after you've exported the video with a sneaky little watermark it's always really nice clear and obvious. Yes there's a resolution limit both the timeline and the export quality has a maximum resolution of ultra HD also known as 3840 by 2160 or 4k ish but you can import footage with a higher resolution than ultra HD so you can import whatever you like you just can't work with a timeline or export video that's higher than that ultra HD you can create custom aspect ratio timelines so you can create landscape, portrait, square, ultra wide whatever you want to do within DaVinci Resolve for free which means you can create really cool looking super wide content or you can make content that's perfect for TikTok, Instagram that sort of thing. Quick note on that though you can't do that ultra HD resolution in portrait as it won't allow you to enter 3840 vertically as well as that resolution limit there is also a timeline and export limit of 60 frames per second again you can import and use higher frame rate footage but your export is capped at 60 now that means if you've recorded some gameplay 120 frames or you've gone out and shot 120 frames on your camera you can still import that you can still use that but you'll be working on a 60 frames per second timeline that does mean that you can slow things down if you're working on a 24 frames per second timeline you can still import 120 frames so that you can slow it right down and get some nice cool sly mo in your free version of Resolve. Now we're going to get into the really complicated subject of bit depth and codecs and formats and all that sort of stuff now because there's so many variations it is really difficult to provide a simple answer my honest advice if you've got a camera which you think i'm not sure this will work just download DaVinci Resolve it's free try it and then let me know down below just give it a whirl basically it's free you won't lose anything that's easier than me trying to answer all the questions of all the different formats and stuff down below but to give you a real rough idea the free version doesn't particularly like 10 bits or above footage it's primarily designed for consumer level 8 bit footage so you can't import any really fancy 10 bit 422 footage it does however accept a huge array of formats and codecs black magic as far as i can tell doesn't really limit the actual codecs you can import into the free version versus the studio version now obviously i can't run through all of those and discuss every single one so instead check out the description there's a link to a handy dandy document by black magic themselves which details all of the formats that are accepted in DaVinci Resolve now onto some of the fun stuff transitions and titles are all basically the same in both versions there's a fair few inbuilt ones some of them are great some of them not so much they're a little bit hit and miss honestly but you can create your own because fusion which is black magic's visual effects suite that also exists within the free version of DaVinci Resolve and again there is a studio version of fusion but the free version gives you pretty much everything you need at least to get started unless you're trying to do anything really really fancy now that means you can create all of your own transitions create your own titles if you really want to but that also means that any presets that are made by people like me or the other youtube creators like patrick sterling hey they will work on the free version of resolve as well unless we include a studio only effect which generally we try not to so you should be good to go now that all leads me really nicely into effects there are a lot of fun effects within the free version of DaVinci Resolve too many for me to go through essentially i've actually just made a video very recently about some of the effects within DaVinci Resolve so i've linked that up here somewhere go check that out if you're really interested in the effects now some of the key effects which you can do in the free version are things like masking slow motion mirroring blanking film which is really great for vertical videos slideshows that sort of stuff speed ramping although it's a bit cumbersome at times you can play things in reverse fast forward all that sort of stuff you can freeze frame so you can pause things have them as a still image you can do green screening also known as chroma king you can do tracking stabilization shake reduction and more there's loads that you can actually do in the free version so what effects aren't included well resolve studio does have some really clever effects which are limited to the studio version some of the key sort of film maker tools which are limited to the studio version are things like lens correction so if you want to de-fish eye a lens or whatever noise reduction that's limited motion blur all that sort of stuff are limited to the studio versions of DaVinci Resolve the noise reduction is very good and there's a really smart AI engine built in to DaVinci Resolve which allows for some other really cool effects so what are they what are some of those effects well we've got things like speed warp which allows you to slow things down even if you haven't shot in high frame rate footage face refinement picks up faces allows you to do some grading on them object removal will automatically pick up on objects and replace them so you can get rid of stuff out of your scene magic mask is literally black magic it's really clever you can just do a little keystroke on something it will automatically pick it up and track it throughout the entire scene so you don't need to do any rotoscoping or manually cutting things out super clever and then we've got things like smart reframe which will pick out subjects and also actually keep them in the center i've made videos for a lot of those so if you're really interested in seeing some in-depth tutorials on how to use those GPU accelerated effects i've linked some of them down below or just check out the backlog on my channel now some of the other things there's some blurs which are limited some missed effects lens flares lens halation and reflection effects and there's one called analog damage which allows you to create sort of a vintage vhs and cctv look like this plus the tools for editing and grading stereoscopic 3d they're all limited to the studio version next up color grading davinci resolve was originally known mostly for its color grading abilities and again black magic haven't skimped on this you think they probably would to be honest but they haven't you get like 90 95 percent of the color grading abilities within the free version so yeah it's great basically it means that you can do most of the things you probably want to do you can adjust your highlights shadows contrast levels colors saturation you can apply lurch you can create lurch you can do all sorts of stuff all the things that you'd expect from a color grading package you can pretty much do multi-cammed and audio sync i don't really know what other categories to put these in but you can do multi-cammed you can sync footage up it will automatically use the waveform to link them up you've got multiple cameras that's in the free version and if you've recorded your audio separately you can really quickly sync that up to your video footage as well it's like one click audio sync done works pretty reliably for me anyway in this environment maybe a bit further when you're out and about but generally it's pretty good that's there as well now all of the other common controls and stuff you'd expect are also present and accounted for that means transforms animated zooms crops key framing that's to do basic animations for anyone that doesn't know picture-in-picture colored backgrounds all that sort of stuff it's all there and it's good to go the same can be said for audio controls there's a system called fairlight that's built in as well this contains loads of handy dandy audio effects like noise reduction not like background noise reduction not noise video noise different it's a different noise noise reduction compression pitch adjustments you get the gist you could have loads of audio tracks and balance them all accordingly for some nice juicy audio design now as i say it's most of the stuff within fairlight some of the really high-end things like dolby atmos mastering and really fancy stuff is limited to the studio version but again for day to day for most people you're good with the free version what about exporting you can export in a bunch of different format and you can control the quality by adjusting things like the bitrate you have plenty of control in the free version you can export your projects pretty much however you want there's built-in templates for popular platforms like youtube and twitter and you can create your own export presets so that you don't have to create them every single time you can even stack multiple projects into a render queue so that you hit render it'll go through 20 projects however many you've set rendering them out one by one so you can go put the kettle on come back and they're all ready to go recently they also made the collaboration features free in the free version of the adventure resolve which is crazy which means for about five pound a month to be able to use the cloud software which is really really cheap you can work remotely across multiple devices i'm going to make a video on that next because it's amazingly useful for the five-quid it costs and you can even work with other editors other colorists from anywhere in the world on the same project just using the free version of the venture resolve it's ridiculous now one last thing people do ask quite a lot is why is it free there's lots of information out there i've linked a few articles down below some conversations with the CEO of black magic a guy called grant petty he's always very forward and very honest about it but the simple fact is they want you to get stuck into the venture resolve they want you to start learning it progress with it become a better video editor or a video creator so that you can eventually start making money from your work you can build a career in video and at that point you're probably going to come back and buy studio you're going to buy one of that black magic cameras or one of their keyboards or one of their panels or whatever it may be it's a really cool business model really rare to see and i'm really really thankful because i wouldn't be here if there wasn't a free version of dementia resolve because that's how i started as well big thanks once again to this video sponsor of nvidia unboxed dot code at uk make sure to check out nvidia studio and if you've already got an nvidia gpu make sure that you're using the nvidia studio drivers that actually make drivers that are specific for creative applications like dementia resolve and they can make things run way smoother so there's a game ready version and there's a studio ready version i always run the studio version so make sure to check it out so there you go i think i've covered everything thanks for watching take it easy i'll catch you next time
