Hello it's Alex here from Alex from 12th Photography with another video. This one is going to be a quick review of this. It's the Tamron 35mm f1.8 VC. It's my go-to lens for my Canon 60. I've had it a couple of weeks now so I thought it was about time I did a little bit of a review. So yeah let's get cracking with the review shall we? The first thing I'm going to talk about is the build quality. So the SP sounds for special performance. It's a new range by Tamron and the build qualities are better than it used to be. Tamron build quality used to be a little bit ropey. This is really well put together. It weighs just under 500 grams so half a kilo so it's actually quite light for this sort of lens. The Sigma 35mm is quite a bit heavier. It balances well on this camera. I have no issues with it. It balances well. It doesn't feel front heavy. It's nice to hold, nice to use that sort of thing. It's a metal construction. It's got a metal barrel. Feels really nice. The filter thread is metal as is the actual mount itself. It's also weather sealed. There's a rubber gasket under here which is always nice to have. It does come with this plastic lens hood which I say is plastic but it feels decent. It feels well made. It clips on, it's reassuring. So yeah no complaints. It doesn't come with a bag so if you like them to come with a bag it does not and it comes with the clasp style lens cap which I much prefer over the old school style which actually most people go with the clasp nowadays. Two switches. The only two things on the lens are VC on and off which I'll talk about in a minute and AF some manual focus. AF and MF focus switches. Really showing a little click. Really quite a nice switches on there. At the top you've got a distance meter. Nice to have. I don't really use one myself but it's always nice to be there. And then the only bit of detailing you've got here is this little SP logo on the side. It's a really nice construction actually. It's a nice design. I think it looks really good. It looks quite stylish. The rebranding, this SP rebranding so far looks really good. Far better than they used to be the Tamarons. It's stylish. It's sort of on-intrusive. It goes well with the camera. Build quality feels good. It feels hefty. Oh one thing I forgot to mention. Manual focus. It's obviously got full-time manual focus override which is handy to have in this price range. You sort of expect that. It's rubber. It's got a rubber texture to it. It's quite light. It turns quite freely but it's got a little bit of dampening to it. There's little bumps up to the end you can feel but it will continue to turn. So no complaints there. I don't really use manual focus at all that much to be honest with you. Not on this anywhere I did on my Sony but not so much in the camera. But there you go. So yeah overall build quality. Quite pleased with that. Not bad at all. Image quality is good. I've been pleased with it. It's sharp at 1.8. The depth of field is obviously really narrow so you do have to be quite precise with it but when you get it sharp it's sharp. It looks quite good at 1.8. As soon as you start dialing it down to f2 to f.8 for it just continues to get sharper. So from a sharpness point of view, from an image quality point of quite happy with that. I am a bit of a pixel peeper so I do like to make sure things are crisp so yeah I have no complaints with it. I'll happily shoot this at 1.8 when I can. It does have some vignetting especially wide open. It doesn't bother me at all. Honestly I couldn't care less because it's so easy to get rid of in post but I actually quite like a bit of a vignette anyway. I usually add it in post. I like a vignette. That's just me. If you don't like a vignette you will have to remove it but it's not that bad. Colour fringing. There's a bit of that as well. A bit of colour fringing. A bit of chromatic aberration. That's the thing when you're shooting into the light again. It's really easy to get rid of in post but if that's a deal that could break it for you you may want to look elsewhere because there's a fair bit of it in there. Flaring. Not bad. I did a little fitness shoot not too long ago and I'll shoot directly into the sun. It handled the flare quite well. There was a little bit of it but it wasn't too bad so I was quite happy with that. Contrast. It's good. Colour has come out quite natural. It looked quite good. I'm quite happy there. The bokeh is smooth. It's spherical. It melts away nicely. It's not distracting as it can be on some lenses. It's good. It looks really good. I have no complaints about that. Image quality wise it's really good. It's spot on. So here we go. I went to the park earlier with the Tamron. There's a couple of test shots I've got for you guys. This one was shot directly into the sun. It was shot at f2.2 and the reason I took this shot is for all this. You can see there's a lot of purple fringing and a lot of colour. Ran the colours going along all these branches when you shoot directly into the sun. Admittedly that's quite a hard thing to shoot for the lens but there's a lot of aberrations there. So as I say that's an issue for you. Maybe skip this lens. It's dead easy to solve so it's not an issue for me but it does exist within this lens. So this one was shot at f1.8 and you can see the bokeh is super smooth. It just melts away. Really nice and focus was on this right here and you can see that's pretty sharp. It's certainly sharp enough for me. The depth of field is tiny because I was pretty close to this but yeah centre sharpness is absolutely fine. This shot here this was at f1.8 and you can see the fence and you can see there's a little bit of a vignette going on. Not a huge amount but a little bit. So if I compare that to this shot here which is at f11 you can see a bit of a vignette but as I say if I can just get rid of that in no time at all and there you go it's gone. So as I say it's not an issue for me. This one here this was at I think it was 2.8 this was pretty much minimum focus distance. This thing was tiny tiny little plant and yeah you can just say this is a 2.8. It's dead sharp perfectly sharp and all the out focus all the bokeh is lovely and creamy. This last one again shooting into the light contrast still there centre sharpness it's still there raise the sharp right in the middle this one was at 2.2 I said 200 and yeah it looks absolutely fine. So I can't complain about any of that. Focus it's accurate enough and it's fast enough it's not the fastest lens I've ever shot with it's certainly not as fast as say my Sony 70-200 f4 which is really quick. It does focus fast enough on my usage but if you want something rapid you might want to look elsewhere but it hits most of the time I've not really had any misses. When I first got it it was front focus in a little bit so I've had to put some micro adjustments in there but nothing too major now it seems pretty spot on. If I minimum to infinity let's do that again. It's not too bad. It's certainly not loud but it's also not silent I've used quieter lenses again but realistically no one's going to complain no one's going to notice it when you're out shooting but it's probably this lens's weakest aspect is it's a little bit louder than some modern lenses and it's probably a little bit slower than some modern lenses so if you have to the fastest focusing lens around this isn't the one to buy but for my usage for everyday usage it's perfectly fine to be honest with you. On the point of focusing the minimum focus systems real selling point for me it's really really close so you can get it's 20 centimeters from the sensor to the subject which means you can get really really close to the point where it's almost almost a macro lens not quite but close that makes it really versatile you can be out and about shooting landscapes and you can get really close and do some details for me car shows I do a lot of general car portrait stuff but then you get really close and do some of the details and the logos and the emblems and stuff without having to fathom around changing lenses. One of the big selling points for me was that close focusing so definitely have a look at that it works really really well that's also probably one of the reasons why it's a little bit slow to focus because it's got such a long range to go through and unfortunately there isn't a limiter if they put a focus limiter from 3 minutes to infinity that'll probably you'll spend it up but there isn't so swing's around about it'll just depend whether you want the absolute speed in which case this isn't the best lens but if you want the versatility have a look at this one. The vibe I'm actually going to call it is the Tamron's equivalent to IS if you shoot canner which is the image stabilisation. I think I've got quite good technique because I can get quite steady shots anyway in terms of we don't need to rely on the VC that much but it's working the way it does seem to make a bit of a difference I've shot this down to 1 tenth of a second perfectly fine and with quite a high keeper rate with the VC on so yeah it's there it's working the way you can't hear it do anything the viewfinder doesn't shake away and then you know sometimes with VC or with IS you'll see it engage and it'll shake and then the viewfinder will lock in you don't see any of that with this so it's quite nice it just works away but it doesn't let you know it's doing anything it's just doing it in the background like a silent little helper so that's really handy to have wouldn't necessarily buy it purely for the VC it's a 35mm you probably manage without it to be honest with you but it's a nice addition certainly not going to be a complaint that it's there anyway. So this is a real quick video test I've got the misses she's holding the camera this is handheld with the 35mm and VC is on so it should be relatively steady you can get an idea of how the VC is working bear with me am I still in focus? Yes of course and that's with the VC off so you may notice a little bit of camera shake as I said at 35mm you know I don't know it's a huge amount not compared to say a 200 but you may notice a little bit of a difference. Price and value that's a bit of a sore one a bit of an iffy one. In America this out for 599 US dollars which is not a bad price but over here in the UK it also retails for 599 pounds which to me is a little bit annoying the pound isn't that strong as the dollar at the minute but you would expect it to sell for a little bit less to be honest with you again the Sigma 1.4 35mm that sells in the US for 850 I believe 850 dollars over here the sales the the Sigma sales for 599 so the Sigma over here is the same price as the Tamron. Now that's a little bit frustrating if the Sigma's valued more which is why it's selling was you know more expensive in America it feels like you're getting a bit of a sore end of a deal over here buying this one instead of the Sigma so weigh that up. I didn't pay 599 pounds for this I've mentioned it in another video I used e-infinity or e-infinity Dane Port from Hong Kong but much cheaper I paid 440 I think it was 430 for this so I saved 170 quid which is quite a lot of money you know it's over 20% of the actual cost so definitely have a look at them if you're interested. Why did I buy this over the Sigma? A I could get it for cheaper as I say I got it for a good 100 or so quid cheaper which was nice and the versatility for me I didn't want to have to be messing around changing lenses to go closer up and to do all this sort of thing I didn't want the faff so that minimum focus distance for me was a massive selling point and the fact that it's smaller and lighter than the Sigma so it's easier to look around so you're not going to put as much pressure on your shoulders on your neck or however you have it so for me they were the two big reasons why I went for it. The VC is nice to have but I wouldn't necessarily buy it over the Sigma per se the Sigma is obviously faster at 1.4 this has the VC so you weigh up what you're going to shoot if you're shooting moving subjects in low light the VC is going to be ever absolutely no use at all so that extra third of a stock for the Sigma may help if you're shooting stationary stuff in the dark the VC will be really useful so maybe have a look at this one. So that's it that's my review of the 35mm it's only in this review I've had it a few weeks I've done a fair few shots with it now so I have an opinion of it that may change over the coming months as I do a bit more I may do another six months review and six months time but initially yeah I'm pleased with it I really am it's a good lens so if this video was useful for you please give it a like give my channel a subscribe if you want to see any more I think I've got about 13-14 subscribers now thanks so we'll get in there yeah thank you very much any comments pop them down below I will definitely read them and I'll see you next time ciao
