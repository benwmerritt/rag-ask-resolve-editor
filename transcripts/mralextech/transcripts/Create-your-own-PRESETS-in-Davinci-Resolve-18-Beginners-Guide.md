This video is sponsored by Squarespace. Hey, what up, folks? It's Alex here. Now, I've got a real quick tutorial for you today, and all I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how to create really simple, basic presets for the edit page within Fusion. Now, if the word Fusion is scarce, you don't worry. We're going to keep it really, really simple. All I'm going to do is show you how to save a text plus as a title and then make them accessible on the edit page. So you don't need to worry about using power bins that will just appear within the effects load tree. You drop them on your timeline and you're good to go. Now, we're also going to do the exact same thing using the open effect. So if you ever use anything from the open effects category, so let's say drop shadows or any of the blur or mirrors or JPEG damage, whatever any of those, I'm going to show you how to create a template using those. And again, it will sit in your effects library. You can customize it, do what you like with it. And then it's always there ready to drop on whatever you like. So grab yourself a drink. This won't take too long. It's going to be a really chilled out old school style tutorial. And yeah, get to it. So the first one we're going to do is the text plus because this is the easiest one. This honestly is incredibly easy. All we need to do, go to titles, grab your text plus and drop it on your timeline. I've got a solid color. Let's just get rid of that. We don't actually need it. So here's my custom title. Now, the reason we're using text plus is because text plus is the fusion based title. A standard text isn't fusion based text plus is built within fusion. Anyway, which is why this method is super simple. Plus the text plus just gives you more customization options than the standard text anyway. So we've got our text plus here and let's just put in Mr. Alex Tech, whatever, put in the thing that you want. So if you use this for a title for an intro for whatever, during your videos, something you do often, pop it in here and then change all of the settings as you usually would. So let's just grab any font. I'm not going to mess around too much with this. Let's change the color. Oh, I don't know. Make it green. Change all of the things within here. We can even go to shading. Let's pop on the red outline and do all the things that we usually do. We'll pop the black shadow on there as well. Once you're done, at the very top right hand corner, you've got this sort of magic wand, Harry Potter icon. This will take you into fusion. So we're going to give that a click and all that's going to do is going to drop us in fusion with our text plus. It's labeled as a template on our nodes area. But if you look in the inspector, all of these controls are exactly the same. So this shouldn't be anything too weird. Now you can customize any more options in here if you need to. I'm happy with that. I'm not happy with that. It's horrible, but let's pretend I am. And we just need to export this. So we're going to come down to our nodes. All we need to do right click on the word template on this node down here, right click, go to settings and then save as. We need to save this in a very specific folder so that it pulls through onto the edit page. Now the problem is, for each result, it likes to open random files. I don't think it always opens the same folder every time. So yours might be a little bit different. So I'm going to show you a real quick way of just dropping it in a standard location and then making sure it's in the right place because trying to navigate the files. Yeah, it's a pain. So yeah, let's do that. So what I'm going to do, I'm just going to go to my desktop and I'm going to create a folder. This just needs to be in literally any location that's easy to access. So I've got a folder on my desktop. I'm going to call it macro. We'll open that up and I'm going to call this ugly green title because that's exactly what it is. And then we're just going to hit save. Now stick with infusion, open up the effects library by clicking on effects top left hand corner and then open up templates, edit titles. Now if you actually click on the word titles, you can either right click and then show folder or just highlight titles. Click on the three little dots in the right hand corner and then show folder. Either way will work. And then this will open up this template edit titles folder. So this is where all of the titles sit that are available on the edit page. Now at this point, you can create custom folders. So you can see I've actually got a few for different reasons. If I want to create one, I simply right click new folder. I'm going to call this one ugly titles, whatever. Call this whatever you want. This will appear as a drop down within your effects library. So you can stay organized. Let's open this up and there we go. Now I'm going to open up my macros folder, ugly green title. We're just going to copy this and paste this into here. So now we've got our ugly green title into our ugly titles folder. Come up with better names. Don't use those styles, but you know what I mean. You know what I do. Now we can close those down back within fusion. If we expand titles, we can now see we've got my ugly titles folder. And within there, I've got ugly green title. So now if we go back to the edit page, that should have updated within here too. Sometimes it doesn't. If you don't see your folder, don't panic. Just basically closed of inch resolve. Open it back up and it should be there. So let's delete that text. Ugly titles. And now I've got my ugly green title. We can just pop it on there. And it's good to go. Done. Create as many of these as you like. Create as many folders as you like to stay organized. Now you can do the exact same thing for effects. So anything that appears within the open effects area. It's marginally more complicated, but it's essentially the same process. So let's take a quick look at that. So let's get rid of my title. I'm going to turn on my solid color so we can see what we're doing. So when I refer to open effects, I'm referring to these. So this is back on the edit page within the effects library. All of these effects. So you've almost certainly used some in the past. You've maybe used some of the blurs or probably the drop shadow or blanking fill edge detects. Anything from within here, even multiples of them, you can save as your own little template. So what I'm going to do, just going to grab a PNG. Put it on there. We'll use the resolve logo. So we don't actually apply the effect though from the edit page. So we don't want to do that. What we want to do is open up this PNG within fusion. So I'm going to right click and I'm going to open in the fusion page. We're essentially just using this image as a template so we can create the thing. It doesn't actually matter what it is really. And then from the effects library once again, you've got open effects. Now, if you have a look, all of these are exactly the same as you'd see on the edit page. So if you've used the open effects, you'll know what you're doing with this. So if we just scroll up, let's find the drop shadow. And we're going to put this on here. What we need to do, we click, we drag, and then we just put our cursor until this yellow line turns to yellow and blue and then release like so. So it's attached. If you miss, so you just drop it here, just hold shift on your keyboard, click drag, and then you'll be able to pop it on there. On our preview, you can see we've got our drop shadow and within the inspector, again, we've got all of the controls you'll be used to. So then you can just customize this. Let's, I don't know, let's make this really harsh and obvious so we can see it. Let's say that I want this drop shadow within my effects library. So I can just grab it whenever I want. Once you're done, all you need to do right click the drop shadow node, but this time we're going to macro and then create macro and this window will appear. Give you a macro name. This is important because this is the name that's going to appear on the edit page. So I'm just going to call this hard shadow or whatever. And then on the left here, you can see we've got drop shadow one. And then under controls, you may need to expand them. You'll see all of these tally with all of these things you've been amending within the inspector. So what we're doing here is we're ticking the things we want to be available to us within the inspector on the edit page. So I'm going to tick shadow strength, drop angles, blurs, and then all of the colors. Legacy comp and blends, I probably don't need those, so I'll leave them as they are. So I'm just going to tick all of those. Once we're happy with that, we simply click file at the top. And then you can do a save as or do a savers group. It doesn't really matter unless you're going to be sharing it. So I'm just going to do a save as for now. And I'm going to do the exact same thing. I'm going to get to desktop and I'm going to open up this macros, this easy to access macros folder. I've got my hard shadow dot setting. So we're going to hit save. Now we'll close that down. Now what we want to do at the same thing again, we're going to expand templates. But this time we're going to edit and then effects. I'm going to click on effects. And then I could right click show folder. And once again, I could create my own folder within here. Now I've actually already got a folder. As you can see, it's called Mr. Alex Tech. So another way to import these, I'm just simply going to grab my hard shadow. I've got my Mr. Alex Tech folder open within Fusion. We're just going to drag this over here. It will change to say copy. We'll release that. And it'll just install this hard shadow into my effects area. Again, as mentioned, if you wanted to go and create some folders, you're more than welcome to do that. So let's hop back onto the edit page. Let's delete that or grab a new PNG down. And now within the effects area, so it won't be an open effects. It's an effect under the folder. If you've called it something, I've got my Mr. Alex Tech within here. I've now got my hard shadow. We're going to drop that on my PNG and job done. We have our hard shadow ready to go whenever we want it. If we give it a click in the inspector, go to effects. We have all of the same controls as we had before. But obviously if we reset them, it's going to default to that template that we created. Super duper simple. Now you can do this as well for more than one thing. It does start to get a little bit more convoluted, a little bit more complicated if you're using loads of different nodes and you're trying to create the macro. But it's essentially the same process. Let me show you really quick. But as mentioned, it does start to get a bit fiddlier around this point. So we're going to do the same thing. I'm going to right click. We'll use this PNG again just for the example. And we're going to open in the fusion page. Now what's really cool about this, if I go to templates, edit and effects, Mr. Alex Tech, I can use that template I've created to create new templates as well. So I'm going to drop the drop shadow on there. So we've got a hard shadow. And then I'm going to go to open effects. Now quick note, it doesn't have to be open effects. You can use anything within fusion. I designed this tutorial around using open effects because it's what you're familiar with from using on the edit page. But yeah, go to down explore experiment, pick whatever you like from the fusion page if you're feeling brave. I'm going to go JPEG damage. So I'm going to grab that and I'm just going to plunk it down here. I'll put it before the hard shadow. Again, if you miss it, hold shift and drag. In the inspector, we've got all of our controls. So we're going to adjust the quality, do whatever we want with this. And again, we do the same thing. But this time what we need to do, click your mouse into like an empty area of the nodes, hold, highlight both the things. So both of our nodes, then we're going to right click macro and create macro. Give it a name. I'm going to call this one JPEG shadow. And you'll see this time we have two column headings. We've got JPEG and hard shadow. So we just do the same thing from my JPEG. What do we want access to another quick tip? You can leave this window open and then still click around fusion. So I can go to my JPEG damage and go, I need quality and res block aspect frequency. Don't care about the scale component. So I want quality, resolution, block frequency from the hard shadow. I want shadow strength, drop angle, all of these things. Take all of those file, save as pop it in my macro folder, save. Close this down. We'll go to templates, edit effects, Mr. Alex Tech. Open my folder. I've got my JPEG shadow. We've dropped that in there. Let's use something completely different this time. Got another JPEG within here. This is just a pretty JPEG. So let's make this a bit smaller. Now within my Mr. Alex Tech folder, I don't have the JPEG damage because for whatever reason this time it's decided not to work. So we're going to have to restart the range resolve, which gives me time to tell you about this video's sponsor, Squarespace. You probably need a website. Everyone needs a website.

Resolve is open again now, so let's jump back in. So we are back. So now if we expand effects, we go to Mr. Alex Tech. We now do have our JPEG damage, so we're going to drop that on there. And as you can see, we have our JPEG damage and we have our harsh shadow. If we give that a click, open up the effects library. We've got our quality, so we can adjust that, our resolution, our block aspect, frequency scale, and then we've also got all of our shadow controls as well. Hey, quick editor notes here. All of those settings files you've stored in your temporary folder, so my example, the desktop, you don't need to keep those. You can delete them once they've been imported. They're in Resolve. You're good to go. But having them on your desktop or having them saved somewhere can be quite useful. You've got them as a backup, but you can also transfer them to other devices. Repeat the exact same process. You can import them on your laptop or a different PC or whatever. It's quite a handy way of doing things. So just wanting to let you know though, if you want to tidy them up, just delete them. You're all good to go. That's all there is to it. Really easy. And it's not talked about enough because it looks like a really complicated process, but it's really, really not. It's really, really simple. So let me know if there's anything from the open effects that you use a lot, or if you've got any really great templates that you've built, watching this tutorial. I'd love to know. Thanks for watching, folks. Take it easy. I'll catch you next time.
