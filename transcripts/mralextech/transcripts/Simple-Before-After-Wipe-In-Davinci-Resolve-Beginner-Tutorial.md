Before, wipe, after, wipe, before again. Hey, what's going on folks, it's Alex here. Welcome to Mr. Alex Tech. So you wanna be able to do a before and after wipe effect in DaVinci Resolve to show off those color grades. It's dead easy, it's dead quick. Let's jump straight into DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you how. So here we are with the DaVinci Resolve for on the edit tab and I've got my footage set up on my timeline. This is my original footage that hasn't yet been color graded. So the first thing I'm gonna do here is give this footage a click on my timeline, holding down the Alt key, I'm just gonna drag that upwards to create a duplicate like so. We're gonna give the top one a click and then we're gonna jump into the Color tab. Now what I recommend that you do, check this timeline here right in the middle of the screen. You should see the two pieces of footage. If you don't see this timeline, just click on the word timeline up in the top right hand corner to activate this one and just make sure that you've got this top track selected. So it's highlighted in red. Once you've done that, go crazy, do all the color grading you want to do, add any nodes, curves, anything that you need to do. So I'm just gonna add some contrast and let's just change the gain a little bit to make it stand out. And then once you're done, we're gonna jump back into the edit tab. So we've got this top track, which is our color graded footage and then if I just hit D on my keyboard, we've got the original footage underneath like so. And then all we're gonna do, move our cursor to the far left of this top track until our cursor changes like so. Click, drag and we're just gonna put this where we want our wipe to start. So I'm gonna go right about there. And then if we were to just hit play, we'd see our original footage. And then when this is kicking, we'd see our color graded footage like so. Then all we need to do, open up the effects library, come down to the toolbox, video transitions, scroll down until you see the wipe area and then grab the edge wipe transition. Drag that and put that on this top clip here like so. And then if we hit play, we've got this real simple wipe effect. If we lengthen that out, that'll just slow that wipe effect down. And if we want to change the angle, just give it a click, open up the inspector in the top right hand corner, the transitions tab, and then we've got the angle. So let's go with 90 and that will go from left to right. You can just adjust it to get it wherever you want it. I'm gonna go with 90. And then if we just hit play, job done. We've got this color grade wipe effect real quick and really easy to set up. So now if you've already color graded your footage and you want to do the same thing, really simple. So this is my color graded footage here. If we're just going to the color tab, you can see it's already got all of my nodes and grades on there. We're gonna do the same thing. So we're just gonna hold the Alt key. We're gonna drag upwards to create a duplicate like so. Jump into the color tab. Again, making sure to check this little timeline in the middle, but this time you wanna go to the bottom clip, not the top one. And then in the nodes, just right click, reset all nodes. And that'll just return this one back to its original form. And then if we jump back into the edit tab, we can just do the exact same thing. This is now our original footage. And then we've got our color graded footage and job done. Add the edge wipe. Change the angle if you need to. And we'll hit play. Ta-da, easy as that.
