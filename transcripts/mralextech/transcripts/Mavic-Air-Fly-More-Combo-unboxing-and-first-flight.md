afternoon folks right today is an exciting day and we're going to do a super quick unboxing video because I've just got my hands on a Mavic Air Fly More combo. Oh how exciting! This is going to be the most half-assed unboxing ever mainly because most of the batteries are on charge and the longer I spend doing the unboxing the less time we're going to have outside flying this thing. So we're going to do this really quickly. This is the Mavic Air Fly More combo and we got it from John Lewis. It's £900 something pounds so it's not cheap, it's a lot of money. The Fly More combo is worth it I believe over the regular one because you get the three batteries and the additional bits and bobs which we'll show you in a second. Yes it's a lot of extra money it's about 200 more than the drone on its own but if you price the components individually it seemed like the better deal. I've gone for the Onyx Black. Everyone says the white one is hard to see. I wasn't that picky in terms of colour from an aesthetic point of view so black or red were the options they only had black so black it is. Let's have a look. So we'll crack it open. First thing we're going to look at is this. This is the little case for the drone itself. So I'm going to open this up. Ta-da! There it is. You can see I have already taken the battery out because the battery is on charge but there it is. Watching this video you've probably seen a fair bit of stuff already about the drone so you know how small it is but it is really surprising. I watched a ton of videos on this thing. It's still amazing when you get it in your hands at how small and how light it is. Yes it's not got a battery in it and the battery is way a fair bit. It still is a really really light device. So you do. Fronts come out like so. Rears down and around. Antennas go down. That's it ready to fly. So there's the drone. This is the carry case. It's actually really quite nice. It's quite a good. Feels quite nice for two. It's quite rugged. Definitely going to make a lot of use of that. You wouldn't want to carry that on its own just in the bags for this. It's really really cool. Next. Put the bugs down. We have the travel bag. Now the travel bag is part of the Fly More Combi. You don't get this in the regular Maverick air package so again it's a nice little extra. It's actually quite nice looking and again it feels while made. It's like a really heavy-duty fabric like a messenger bag star material. Little DJI logo on the front and a nice shoulder strap and inside. Open her up. We have the controller. Open them open. Phone goes in here. Joy pads come out there. Screw in there. Antennas. Simple as. What's up we got? Box of goodies. Extra propellers. Definitely not a bad thing. I'm going to try not to crash it but not a bad thing. USB type A to USB type C. Now I've already read up on that. You can't charge with this. It's purely to move any video or photos you've got stored on the internal storage to your PC. So that's cool. With this. Additional joysticks on the options that you lose them. I'm going to try desperately hard not to lose them but handy. Additional cables. Different types of cables. On the controller you have this on the side which is where you connect your device. So I have a Google Pixel XL2 so I need the type C but you also get a Apple Lightning cable and a standard micro USB. This over here is again this is the extra that you get within the Flymore combo and it is a Mavic Air battery to power bank adapter. So here's one of the batteries. They do come in here. Everybody had them out to charge them and all you do is pop that on there. Then you've got a female USB type A port there which you can then use to charge your phone. Really cool. Itself is the battery. In the Flymore combo you get three of these. Pretty much the main reason why you'd go for the Flymore combo over the regular because you get three of these compared to one. So the Flymore combo actually starts to become reasonable value when you look at the price of the batteries. And that's it. What was in here which I've removed is the charger. You get a standard charger which charges one battery but again in the Flymore package you also get an adapter which I'll show ding here which allows you to charge four batteries consecutively. Get the box back. In here we have propeller guards. If you're flying it if you're a noob like I am I am a noob but I'm not going to put these on for the time being. And then a whole bunch of instructions which I am actually going to take the time to read. And that's it. I told you it was going to be a really terrible really quick half-assed unboxing because I want to go out and play. And that's what we're going to go do next. We're ready to go. We're in beginners mode. We have satellites. You ready? I'm scared. Hang on. Just the best thing ever. Yeah just a bit. So we've done a maiden voyage. We're halfway through one battery. We have spare. Watch Rebecca's annoyance. It's so cool. I don't care that this makes me a child. This is cool. It's really cold. So actually Becky first impressions. It's pretty cool. It's amazing. It's pretty cool. Pretty cool. First impressions. It's really cool. It's a great bit of tech. And it's really easy to fly. It's Becky's turn next. You're going to fly it next. So yeah this was just a real quick video unboxing and flying maiden voyage of the Mavic Air. I'm going to be doing loads of videos on this obviously. I've got a whole weekend of it and I've got a few days off next week to play with the drone. But for now we are going to, well it is lovely as you can see. It's not a bad evening. We're going to go to the pub. We're going to get some food aren't we? Yeah. A warm up. Maybe even a cheeky beer. Although I'm driving today. That's it for now folks. Sunset. Bye.
