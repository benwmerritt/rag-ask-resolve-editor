What up folks, it's Alex here, I hope you're well. Quick no frills video for you today. It's literally just me sat here, camera on a tripod, me talking directly to you, because I wanted to take a few moments to just say real quick, thank you. It's weeks and every one of you for everything that you've done for the channel. By that I mean subscribe or thumbs up, thumbs down, any comments or feedback or anything at all that you've done for the channel. It really means a lot. And you're the reason why I'm sat here now with the channel with 30,000 subscribers. So that's just insane, it's amazing and I wanted to just take a moment out to say thank you. It's awesome, it's weird, I still find it weird. I found it weird when there's a thousand people subscribed to the channel, now there's 30,000 people and it's still just as weird, if not even more weird, you weirdos. Thank you, thank you for subscribing and supporting me and the channel and everything that we do. Did you know there's countries with a population less than 30,000? No I didn't, I didn't know that until the other day. So technically, if we all got together, we'd be bigger than some countries. Who knew? That's weird, it's cool, it's amazing, but it's very strange. Anyway, the main reason I made this channel and I keep doing what I'm doing is just because it's fun. It's real nice that I'll outlet for me, I get to have a bit of fun, create some videos. I learn new techniques, I sometimes look at what's popular and what people are doing and go right, how do we do that? So I'm learning, I'm gaining a lot of stuff from it as well. So it's just a real fun, cool outlet for me to do. That's the main reason, that's the driving force. But another reason is it's really nice to know that I'm enabling, I'm giving people information so that they can go out and do their own thing as well. I know there's an awful lot of you out there that are better creators than me, better editors or filmmakers or whatever, more creative, more artistic and that sort of thing. You might just not have the grasp of DaVinci Resolve as I do. So all I'm doing is providing quick tips, quick bits of information to enable you to really edit what you see in your head and really create your own visions and yeah, I'm just enabling you to do that and that's why I give things out for free and do what I do, because it's really satisfying to know that I'm able to do that. Going forwards, yeah, we're just gonna keep doing what we're doing, we're throwing some additional stuff, whatever that may be, we'll keep playing around, keep experimenting, keep trying to find my own feet. I know where I am in terms of tutorials, I don't know exactly what I want to make, I don't always know what I want to do in terms of some of the other videos, so I'm still sort of finding my own feet with that, but I'll keep playing, listening to feedback and we'll just sort of grow from here and keep doing what we're doing, really. I do have some fun ideas I wanna try in the future, so we'll give those a go somewhere further down the line when things go back to normal and we'll see how all that goes as well. On top of that, I've been having some fun, I've been looking at some other things, some sort of merch and t-shirts, which I put on my Instagram the other day, seemed like a fun idea, so I'm gonna have a little play with that. I do have a much bigger idea, a giant idea, probably too big of an idea for a website that I'd like to create, which would basically be, this is where I'd describe it, basically like a full DaVinci Resolve resource hub, although not limited to just DaVinci Resolve. When I create these videos, I may go out and film B-roll, for example, or I'll film something or other. I don't really do anything with that footage, so it makes sense for me to put it somewhere so you can download it and use it in your project, so it becomes stock footage, essentially. So it'd be really cool to create my own one, sort of a Mr. Alex Tech resource thing. I can put all the transitions on there, I can do any title packs that I do, they can go on there, stock footage, any sound effects and music. I have a few musician friends, I'm gonna work with them in the future to try and do some cool stuff. So yeah, there's a big idea to try and create this big thing that provides loads of value to you guys, and it's another little project for me to work on. So that's something I'm gonna look at in the future. Don't know how difficult that will be. I don't know how that would work in terms of monetization or what we'd do with that. I'd probably do, you know, if you like a Patreon style, if you become a member, you get all that stuff. So it's added value. So if you do become a member, you do that thing that YouTube has asked for, it's not just so I can sit here and make these videos, which I'd be doing anyway. I'll be providing some proper real life value, some resources for you guys to use. So then I'm not just asking for money for nothing, really. So yeah, that's a plan for the future. We'll have a look at that and see where it goes. If you think that sounds like a cool idea, let me know. If you've got any comments or feedback or whatever, other cool ideas, other things you'd like to see, let me know in the comments. I'm gonna try and read them. This is the most first world problem ever. It's really hard to get through all the comments. Yeah, a lot of comments. When you sit there and you finish your video and you edit it and you think, oh, I need to go have a cup of tea and a biscuit. And then you come back and there's loads of comments and it's difficult. So I apologize if we do miss comments. If I go past them and you don't get a like or a thumbs up, whatever for me or a reply, I apologize. I'm gonna try and get better. I'm gonna put time aside specifically to go through and make sure I do all my comments. Because I don't like leaving you guys hanging. So yeah, anyway, so that's it, really. I just wanted to say face to face big thank you and give you a little idea of where we're going with the channel and what the plans are. I don't have a goal in terms of subscribers. 50,000 is probably the next big one. What's up, 100,000 after that? Nah, that's okay. Anyway, enough ramblings and waffling and all that sort of rubbish that I always do in these videos. Thanks ever so much for watching. I hope you're all doing well. Hope you're keeping safe. All that jazz. I'll see you for my next video whenever that may be. Should be tomorrow or day is it? Thursday, should be tomorrow. And yeah, I'll see you next time. See ya. That was a waffling, wasn't it? No.
