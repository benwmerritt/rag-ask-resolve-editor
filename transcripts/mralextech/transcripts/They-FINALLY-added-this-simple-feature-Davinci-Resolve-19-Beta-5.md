Right click your bin, re-sync media files and new files will appear like magic in your media pool. Yeah, Blackmagic have done it. They've added a feature to DaVinci Resolve that people have been asking for for ages. Now it's not perfect, but it's a pretty good start. It is currently only in the beta version and today Blackmagic released DaVinci Resolve 19 beta number five. Now as this is a beta, it won't pop up in your standard version of DaVinci Resolve. If you're feeling brave and you want to install it, simply head over to the Blackmagic Design support website. There's a link in the description below. And from the latest downloads, you'll see DaVinci Resolve 19 public beta number five and DaVinci Resolve Studio 19 public beta number five. And then you can download the Mac Linux, Windows x86 or Windows ARM versions. And yes, there was a beta update to my hair as well. It's all gone. Anyway, let me show you what's included. There's a link to this page down below as well. We can read all of the new features introduced in this public beta number five. We've got things like up to three times faster AI performance on supported Intel Windows systems. We've got some new transition controls on the cut page. The cut page now shows render cache activity, the ability to select audio monitoring channels in replay workflows, support for transcribing timelines as nested clips, and then a bunch of other stuff. Now there's also some scripting API updates and some general bug fixes and stability improvements. So generally, nothing all that interesting. But what is new and what's worth talking about? Well, the first one is this new resolve FX film look creator core look options for emulating different stocks. So I made a dedicated video talking about the film look creator. I think they went up on the channel a week or so ago. It's a feature in DaVinci Resolve 19 that I really like. It allows you to create filmic looks really quickly and easily just using a single tool. But what's new is this the core look. So by default, in the previous version, you only had this cinematic look applied and you couldn't kind of change that it was baked in. You could use this blend to turn it on or off, but you still only had one look. Now there's five cinematic Rochester, Achesaca, elated and vintage, and they just give it slightly different looks. So you can pick which one you want to choose. And then you can still come in change the exposure, all of the color settings, the split tone, vignette, halation bloom and all that other good stuff. And I think that's pretty cool. It gives you more ways to customize your grades, your look really quickly using this film look creator. Now it's still not emulating any specific film stocks, but they probably are kind of secretly, they may be kind of just tweaking these to look like popular film stocks, even though it can't be called the codec 1700 or whatever it may be. And maybe if they continue expanding this list or give us the ability to add our own, it's really going to expand the usability of this film look creator. So again, I think it's pretty cool. And it really is kind of taking the fight to things like the answer and film convert nitrate, which are tools which allow you to have these film stocks, and then add halation and all that sort of stuff. Now it's kind of integrated into the DaVinci Resolve Studio. So it's a cool addition. It'd be interesting to see where it goes. Next up, this new automatic str to HDR tone mapping using resolve FX Nvidia RTX video HDR on Windows, and new 2x and 4x SuperSkyle options using Nvidia RTX video on Windows. So if you're running DaVinci Resolve Studio on a Windows PC, and you've got either a 30 series or 40 series Nvidia RTX GPU, you can make use of some new tools. Now the first one is an str to HDR tone mapping tool. And the idea is by simply turning on the feature, the AI network will turn any standard or low dynamic range content into HDR performing the correct tone mapping so the image still looks natural and retains its original colors, which is pretty cool if you're looking to create some HDR content. I've not had any chance to play with that or figure out how it works or even set up a timeline, but I will play with that at some point going forward. The other one is the new addition to super scaling. Now again, this is studio only so it's only in the paid version. But we've got this footage on the timeline. This is actually low resolution footage. It's like 4 ATP. And in the super scale option, then the inspector, we can change the super scale. We now have a 2x Nvidia RTX video and a 4x Nvidia RTX video. You can give that a click, set it to say ultra, and it's going to upscale this video. It's probably going to be hard to see in this video demonstration, but it is actually quite good. It will get rid of any compression artifacts and try and sharpen up the footage so that it looks much much better on your 4k timeline. And because it's using this Nvidia RTX video thing, it's running natively on your GPU. So we can do all of that seemingly in real time. And even when you render the footage, it renders super quick. So it's not like some of the previous super scale options which did take a while to render. This flies and you wouldn't even really know it's doing anything at all. It's probably very similar technology to what they're using in their video games, which allows you to upscale low resolution footage to get higher frame rates, that sort of thing. And that's all designed to be super low impact. So it's again, another pretty cool addition. And the last one is the one I hinted at at the beginning, action to re-sync a media pull bin to include new media in the original folder. Now this really is cool and it is something that people have mentioned they want for ages. I always see the comments down below whenever I talk about bins and folders and power bins and all that sort of stuff. What this allows you to do is simply right click and then refresh a media pull bin. And it will go and check the original folder on your hard drive and see if anything new has been imported. It's kind of like a live folder. It won't automatically refresh just yet. But it looks like it's going in that direction, which is a really cool feature. Now currently, it does only work for video, it won't pick up things like music or sound effects or JPEGs and all that sort of thing, which is a bit of a shame. But hopefully that functionality comes in the future. Anyway, let's have a look. So I've got this folder here called testing. And we've got another folder within that folder. And then we've got a couple of clips in each. So if I just grab this testing and I drop it into this project over on the left hand side of my media pull, it will import the folders and it will import the clips. And now I've got these two clips and we've got this testing to folder. Now the cool thing, let's open this up and we'll just add some more footage to this clip. Now we right click on the folder and we go to Resync Media Files and it's automatically going to update and bring in those new clips. Now that also works within the sub folders, the sub bins within your original bin. So if I open up testing to, we'll add some new clips in there as well. So testing to at the moment only has three. But if we go to the top level testing and we're racing the media files, we go to testing to we now have the additional files within there. Quick note on that, that won't work if you come into your hard drive and then just make a new folder. If we refresh that, that won't pick up that new folders there. So you have to have the structure set up on your hard drive for when you import it. But then any new clips that you add to the main folder or any of the sub folders will then automatically update. Now it's also worth mentioning it works in power bins too. So we've got this testing folder. There's only one clip in there. Let's open it up and we'll add some more clips. And then in the power bin, same thing, right click, Resync and it'll bring new stuff in. Editor Alex here. I've also just noticed literally while editing this video that we now have a keyboard shortcut for this as well. So if we just search for Resync Media Pool, Resync, I've assigned mine to be the R key. So then all we need to do, I can click on the folder within the media pool, hit R on my keyboard and that will do a quick Resync. Nice. So that's it. That's beta number five. We still have no idea when DaVinci Resolve 19 is going fully live, but fingers crossed it won't take too long. Thanks for watching folks. Take it easy. I'll see you very soon. Bye.
