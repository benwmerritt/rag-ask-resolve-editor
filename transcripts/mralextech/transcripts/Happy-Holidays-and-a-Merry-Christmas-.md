What up folks, it's me, it's Alex, Mr. Alex Tech, I hope you're all good and merry Christmas, happy holidays, whatever you're doing, whatever you're celebrating, whether you celebrate Christmas or not, have a good one. I'm currently in the middle of wrapping some presents so I figured I'd just hop on. So a quick hello and wishful and merry Christmas. This is Smeg. Yes, it is a toaster, which I know seems like a weird gift, but it's what people ask for so it's what they get. It's not what I'd ask for, but it's the right. Not big enough. Oh, so nice. This one all fit. This one's not going to fit either. Come on. How did I do that so badly? Oh, I hate wrapping. Anyway, I need to crack on because I've got to go out in a minute so I haven't gone very long, but have a lovely time. Oh, have a great break doing whatever you want to do and I'll catch you all sometime between now and the new year. I'll probably post another video at some point, try and get some more divisive stuff out and probably have some fun with some other bits involved while I'm off work as well, but I am also going to take this time to just chill out and do nothing. Probably build some Lego as a Christmas tradition. So I'll probably mess around with a bit of that. So once again, as I always say, thanks so much to all of you for following, liking, commenting, doing all you do for the channel. 58,000 of you as of today. Literally rolled over this morning. So we're going to end the year at about 58 in a bit. Thousand subscribers and we started the year at 14,000 subscribers. So that's not bad going at all. 2021 the year for 100,000 subs, I think that's the goal, but we'll shall see. We'll play it by ear. I need to cut more paper this time. Please. I got this. Look at that. That's pretty good. How do you wrap that? I mean, I could take out that. What do you say? I'm going to roll it. I'm going to roll it. That's what I'm going to do. Let's go roll it up and see what happens. Well, the edges in. Yeah, that'll work. Oh, I can make it look a big cracker. Get away with that. That looked too bad. Now do. Right. Let me know down in the comments what you're doing this year. You having a good Christmas? Did you celebrate Christmas? Where you going? What you doing? How's things where you are in terms of the dreaded restrictions and lock downs and that sort of thing. We're all a bit weird in the UK. We can't really visit anyone or do much, but have a great Christmas all done wrapping. So now I can go get some food. So that's it. Take it easy, folks. Catch you next time. See you soon. Have a good Christmas. Happy holidays. Yada yada yada. Ho ho ho. Take it easy. Bye. Merry Christmas.
