What up folks, Alex here. Now in some of my previous videos I showed you how to do some really simple but really handy things like picture-in-picture, multi-cam, speed changes and transforms and crop. Now sometimes you want to be able to copy the properties from one of your clips on your timeline to another without having to manually do it all again. And you can do that with a really simple copy and paste. And in this video I'm going to show you how. So here I am in DaVinci Resolve and I'm on the Edit tab. Now as you can see I've set up two of the more common examples for this. So the first one I'm going to show you is Clip Speed or Slow Motion. So I've got two clips here, just short clips and they're both currently in real time. So here's some coffee and then here's some water. Now I want to make both of these slow motion. So I'm going to select the first clip, I'm going to right click, change clip speed and set that to be 20%. That's nice and easy. So that's now running at 20% speed. But I want to apply the exact same thing to the next clip. Now I could right click, change clip speed and just do the exact same thing. But let's imagine I've got a whole bunch of clips and I don't want to have to do it manually every time. I'm going to go to my source clip, I'm going to right click and I'm going to select Copy or you can use the Ctrl C shortcut. And then I'm going to go to the next file, I'm going to left click first to highlight it and then right click and then I'm going to select Paste Attribute. Alternatively you can use the Alt and V key and this window will appear. And it's telling you that it's copying it from C0029 in my case and it's applying it to C0027. You can also do this to multiple clips at a time. And then here are all the things which you can copy from the source file to your new file. So we've got zoom, scale, yaw, rotation, opacity. We've got crops from the left, right, top, bottom, etc. We've also got audio so you can copy the volume, plugins and equalizer. And right at the bottom we have retime effects. So I'm going to tick that. So I'm going to click on Apply and it's pasted the exact attributes from this file to this file. So now if I hit Play, that file is now also in slow motion. Now another example for this is MultiCam or Picture in Picture. So I've got two clips here. Now this is a MultiCam but I don't want to switch between them. I want to show both of them at the same time like a Picture in Picture. Now at the moment I've just stacked them one above each other. So if I hit Play you're just going to see this top clip. So I'm just going to transform this to get it to the size that I want it. I'm going to remove it over to the left and it will reveal the video underneath. Now again, I could manually repeat the process for this clip but I don't want to. So I'm going to hit Ctrl C here. I'm going to click on the second clip and do Out and V. This time I'm going to unselect my retime because it's not the retime that I want to change. I'm going to paste in my video attributes and then I'm going to click on OK. I can untick or select just the ones I want from here. In this instance I'm just going to leave them all selected and click Apply. Now it looks like the clip's disappeared but it's actually just hiding directly underneath this one because they're in the same location and they're the same size. So then all I need to do is move this one over to the right hand side and then if I hit Play and it's as easy as that to copy attributes from one clip on the timeline to another. And that's it. Easy as that. Ctrl C, Alt V. Get used to it, remember it, start using it and your saviours have a whole bunch of time. If it was useful, as always, give me a thumbs up. If you've got any feedback, comment below and don't forget to subscribe for more DaVinci Resolve videos. That's it for this one. Hope you all have a good weekend. I know I will. Take it easy. See you next time.
