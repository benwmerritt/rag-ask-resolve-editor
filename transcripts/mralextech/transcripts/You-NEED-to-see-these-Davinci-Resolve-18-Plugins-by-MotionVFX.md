Yeah, another free preset for DaVinci Resolve. This here is another great one and it's the M-Cam Rig. This is an awesome little add-on which allows you to do those animated camera movements really quickly and easily in DaVinci Resolve. But this one is not from me. This is from our friends over at Motion VFX. Now Motion VFX did reach out to me so this is a sponsored video and they provided a 15% off discount code of everything in store providing it's not already discounted. So if you want a bit of a bargain just use the code MrAlexTech15 at checkout to knock 15% straight off. Winner! But I actually use Motion VFX packs in most of my videos because they're really simple to use, they look great and it saves me loads of time so I'm more than happy to talk about them anyway. So in this video of course I'm going to give you a demonstration to show you how to use that M-Cam Rig but I'm also going to give you a real quick demonstration of some of my other favourites like the M-Tuber 3, a really great pack for any YouTubers out there, M-Tutorial, obviously the one I'd probably use the most being a tutorial maker and then one of that latest which is that M-Callouts Simple 2 which are proper tracked callouts of which there is also a free sample so you can download it for free, try it out and make sure it runs okay on your system. But before we get into all of that let's open up DaVinci Resolve and take a quick look at this freebie, the M-Cam Rig. So here we are on the edit page of DaVinci Resolve and I've got this image on my timeline which we're going to use for this demonstration. So once you've installed the M-Cam Rig we just need to add it onto our image. So we're going to open up the effects library, top left hand corner, within the toolbox you go to effects and you can expand that just clicking on the little arrow to the left, you should see motion v effects, expand that, find your M-Cam Rig and within there there's just one simple tool, give it a click and then drop it onto your image on the timeline like so. And if we go to the beginning and hit play you can see we've got a real simple zoom in and then zoom out. Now we need to customize it so we're going to give it a click, open up the inspector, top right hand corner, go to the effects tab and you'll see all of your M-Cam Rig controls within there. You can turn off and on those in and out animations, I'm going to leave them there for now and then in the camera controls this is where you control your sort of camera animations. So I'm going to go back to the beginning, go to about here. We're going to skip down first of all to this zoom so we actually control the zoom level just by using the zoom in and out to see how much we actually zoom in. We can change the pivot which is the area that we're zooming in to by simply changing the pivot to move it around. So I'm just going to reset my zoom pivot and my zoom. And see there we've got all of these different rate controls so this actually controls your movement animation. So if I just increase this zoom rate what's going to happen is it's going to zoom in at the beginning and then throughout the entire animation it's also going to continue zooming in. If we wanted to zoom in more throughout we can increase our zoom rate or we can bring this back. We can actually go to negative numbers if we wanted to zoom in at the beginning and then slowly zoom out as it goes. Underneath that we've got our X and Y slide rate so this just adds either lateral on the X axis or vertical movement on the Y axis. So if you wanted to just move throughout the entire animation you can add a bit of X and Y and it just gives it a little bit of movement like so. And then we've got pan. So pan obviously just pans your image like so you can again go to positive or negative numbers. If we just increase the pan that will just put it on its axis like so but not actually animate it. If we want it to be animated we just increase this pan rate or decrease it depending on which way you want it to be animated. And then if we hit play and throughout the entire process you can see the pan it's just going to animate like so and then it's going to flip out at the end. The tilt is the same but it's your left and right tilting so what I would tend to do I'd add a little tiny bit of pan and then a little bit of tilt and then if we hit play it will zoom in. Do our little movement all throughout animating as we need to and then it will pop out at the end. And then last but not least we've got roll which just adds essentially some rotation to it. Again you probably don't want to do too much just a tiny bit just to add that tiny bit of rotation like so. So that all your camera controls and then there's some additional things that you can do underneath. Now we get a whiz through this but in the effects controls you've got things like sharpen so if I tick that it'll just sharpen your image and then you can control how much sharpening gets applied. We've got prism if we tick that and then just increase our aberration distance you can see you get this cool prism blur it's almost like an RGB effect and again it will pop in as it goes and animate throughout. We've got our Gaussian blur so again I'm just going to increase the amount and then we can choose the blur range just increasing or decreasing this. This will actually follow the zoom pivot so wherever your pivot point is that will also be your center of focus and it just gives it a really nice almost bokeh depth of field sort of effect which works really well for images, slideshows and that sort of thing. We've also then got pixelate and a grid function. Now there are also mask and background controls but I'm going to skip those for now if you want to know more about those check out the Motion VFX YouTube channel which I've linked down in the description below. It's simple and it's free so what's not to like. Next up we're going to do a quick demonstration of this M-Tuber 3 pack. This is really great overall general pack for any YouTubers out there. It contains a great mixture of about 72 time saving visual tools so let's open it up and have a real quick look. So we're back on the edit page now I'm going to open up my effects library once again because the M-Tuber 3 pack contains a variety of different things you need to remember that exists within video transitions, titles and effects. So if I just expand titles for example expand my motion VFX you can see I've got my M-Tuber 3 if I expand that as well we've got categories within there and we've got our things like backgrounds, calls to action, chapter bars, intros, social media. So I'm going to grab backgrounds for example they're really simple you just drag, drop, put them on there, hit play, they animated in, they animate as they go and then they're animated out as well. As with anything if you give it a click in the inspector there's loads of controls within there so you can change the colors, change how all of this looks really quickly and easily. Calls to action these are great these are things like subscribe to my channel, like the video, share the video all that sort of fun stuff. This one in particular is really nicely animated and you can see there's a drop zone so we're going to pop that on there and if we hit play we just get this little animation popping up with the little subscribe animation like so. Now the cool thing with this, this drop zone can be customized so if I just give this a click in the inspector I go to my avatar controls and you can see it says file name and browse so we can pick up basically any image to be replaced in this little center. So I'm going to go to browse and I'm just going to pick up an image of me so I've got me now in there and we can just change the media scale and the offset just to get it in the right spot and then when we hit play I'm just animated in with my subscribe button everything else easy peasy. The intros again really nicely animated intros there's seven of those within here and once again they're really really easy and simple to customize. So I'm going to grab this intro too and we'll just put it on my timeline hit play we've got this really nice little animation popping in. Now again we've got your logo written here obviously we don't want that so instead give a click inspector we've got logo controls we can change it to be logo or text so if I change it to text we can simply write the name of my channel so I just put Mr. Alex Tech in there but if I want the logo I simply change that to logo again I've got this custom logo with the browse give that a click I'm going to pick up my actual logo this time and it will just drop it in there and once again if we go back hit play my logo is just going to pop in it's going to be really nicely animated like so we can change all the text or the color or the different effects to get this introduction looking exactly as we want it. We've then got things like social media so we've got little social media lower thirds we've got social media icons these are really funky because they're all in 3D so this is a really nicely animated once again 3D YouTube logo but we've also got Vimeo, Twitter, Twitch, TikTok, Snapchat pretty much everything you need within there and then lastly on this titles area we've got typography which is just little lower thirds and titles that are specific for YouTube so they've generally got the YouTube logo on them and they're using the red and white color palette again because it's for YouTube. Down in the effects area same thing open that up motion VFX within here we've got M-Tuber 3 and we've got things like corner screens this is great for any gamers you just pop that effect onto something and it will pop it down in the bottom right hand corner great for sort of webcam videos and then we've also got tools. Now the tools there's loads of additional things so we've got additional screens we've got dashed selection boxes we've got little indicators as well as something like this which I really like which is just a little specs pop out so I'm going to just drop this on this clip here and if we go to the beginning hit play this little specs box pops up. If we go to the effects let's make this a little bit bigger so you can see exactly what it is and you just list the specs within there this is particularly useful if you don't any sort of b-roll you want a really quick way of just listing through the specs of an item you can just do it like that. Now last but not least the video transitions in the M-Tuber 3 we've got five nice unique again following the YouTube color palette but it can be changed if you want to little transitions which work really well and look really really funky. Now if you're more of a tutorial creator like me then the M-Tutorial pack might be a little bit more up your street. It's not dissimilar from the M-Tuber pack but it's focused more on tutorials and the more corporate side it's a little bit cleaner a little bit more stylish that sort of thing so it's a really really nice one. It contains a total of 107 presets and again we've got things like titles placeholders transitions backgrounds all that sort of fun stuff but my favorites are the focus effects these are really swish little animations which just allow you to focus people's attention on certain things on screen. I actually use these in awful light in all of my videos and I do quite often get comments from people asking how I did the effects and it's from here it's from this M-Tutorial pack so let's swing back into the DaVinci Resolve and I'll give you a real quick demo. So much like M-Tuber 3 M-Tutorial is split up into different categories so within the video transitions area within the effects library I've got my M-Tutorial and then we've got the transitions within here. Now again these are really nice transitions which are specific for trainee or tutorial style content so as you can see we've got this one let's move on to another subject and it just transitions between your two shots. Any of these once again can be customized really quickly by going to the inspector and just using the controls within there. If we scroll down to the titles, motion VFX, let's go to the M-Tutorial and then you've got a bunch of things within here. So we've got these really nice little add-ons things like little mouse click icons and highlights as well as these keyboard shortcuts which again I use all the time in my videos it's really easy just drop it on there give it a click reposition it as you need to. If you go to the button controls you can select how many buttons you actually need to display so in my case let's say it's two and then in the button controls you just specify what the keyboard keys are so in this case let's say it was shift and control type that in there job done and if we go to the beginning hit play just animate in and out as required. Again you can change the font the size and do all that sort of fun stuff. There's really nice professional looking backgrounds with not too much going on they're not too jazzy they've got some nice animations but they're nothing too crazy. We've got guides things like the golden ratio there these little aspect ratio guidelines as well as a grid. If we scroll down we've got a bunch of lower thirds these are just nice lower thirds for introducing chapters or different sections of your tutorial or intros that sort of thing. Underneath there we've got a bunch of calls to action now these are nice little animations that don't really fit into any other category so we've got things like a price for a course we've also got a difficulty level so you can rate the tutorial just a nice swish little animation down here we've got this one individual user with details of the course you can maybe put multiple of those on screen once and give people the option. We've got more pointers so you can highlight things on screen and then we've got a bunch of titles as well. Once again you can see that I've got your logo written on this title here if I pop that on my timeline I can give it a click go to my logo controls and can change the logo as we need to to make sure that it fits with my brand or whatever we need. Now if we pop down to the effects area motion vfx m tutorial and then we've got a bunch of stuff within here we've got this focus area and then placeholders these are the ones that I use the most probably because these focus tools are really nice ways of highlighting things on screen if you're doing a tutorial. Now I like to apply these with an adjustment clip I find it a little bit easier so I'm just going to go to my effects grab an adjustment clip put it on there go back to m tutorial let's just grab this one here focus number four pop that on my adjustment clip and it's just going to open up don't forget about this part highlight the section on screen and then animate out if we give it a click in the effects area content controls let's just adjust this make it a bit bigger I want it to be right over this sort of box something like that hit play and there we go it's a really nice way of highlighting things on screen if I don't want that one I'm just going to delete it using my little trash can icon if we just scroll down we've got this focus number 12 this is the one I like personally I generally use this if we hit play just zooms in blurs and darkens everything out so you can just see whatever's in the box if that's too dark effects effects controls you can actually just turn down the background blur or change the color of the overlay whatever you need to get it looking just right and then last but not least we've got these placeholders now these are generally sort of picture in picture things so if you're doing a tutorial and you want to have a little face cam I'm right hand corner you can do that as well as displaying multiple different images with things like this outcome comparison one or you want people to be able to choose a level you can just stack these so let's drop this one on here we've got the intermediate on the left make a quick duplicate of that in the effects area content control make this one the right one and now we've got both a left and a right we just changed the text for this to say advanced maybe and then you've got a really nice animated intro advising people of the two different levels of your course and after you go really nice really specific stuff that works really well for any sort of online tutorial content and last but not least we've got the M callouts simple to pack these are these tracked callouts which look great and work surprisingly well into which resolve however they are a little bit resource heavy things can sugar little bit when you're doing that motion tracking now because of that they've actually released a free sample so that you can go test them out for yourself on your system to make sure they run okay before you spend any of your hard earned cash winner now the method I'm going to show you is the method which I found works really really well and it's quick and easy to do but there is a more detailed tutorial video by motion VFX themselves which have linked down below fun fact the video is actually created by a boy Patrick Sterling a fellow DaVinci resolve YouTuber so if you're into fusion definitely go check him out I've linked his channel down below right without a delay last time let's hop back into resolve and I'll show you how this one works as well so for these callouts I like to use adjustment clips so within the effects library effects adjustment clip and pop it on there like so now as that callouts you would expect them to be in titles but they're actually not they're actually under effects so if you expand effects expand the motion VFX and then within here you'll see your M callouts simple to give that a click and then you've got all of your callouts within there as you can see there's 50 of them in total you can scrub through any of them to have a little preview to see what they're going to look like let's go with this number 47 I'm going to drop this directly onto my adjustment clip like so what we need to do move our player to the very beginning of the adjustment clip like so and then underneath your preview window use your little drop down and then go to the fusion overlay and they'll open up this which looks a bit crazy but don't worry all the bit we're interested in is this bit here which says tracker so I'm going to grab this little box you use the little box in the top left hand corner of the tracker move it around I think that's my screen recorder makes it disappear when I'm moving it but hopefully it won't for you you can change the size of the box if you need to and you just want to put this over your subject like so so I'm going to go with something like that hopefully that should do the trick then with the adjustment clip still selected in the inspector go to effects and then you've got these tracking tools at the very top so what we're going to do hit this one on the right to play all the way through and it's just going to do the track for us you'll see these track center references just doing something crazy as it tracks through the clip now as mentioned you could do this in fusion which is what motion effects actually advise to do but I found that this works really really well so there you go it's done my track did it really quickly so we're just going to click on okay now I can turn the fusion overlay off just by clicking on the little icon and now if we just scrub through because it doesn't always play back in real time but you can see that it's tracking my person on this mount on top really really well it's actually spot on it's done a perfect job there and that took no time at all if we give it a click still within the inspector and the effects area we can then control how that looks so if I go to the call out controls we've got this one here it says call out movement it's currently set to linked what that means is the call out will move with the person like so if we want it to be static we can change this to static and then the only thing that will move is the little dot that's attached to the person not the text itself so as you can see the text will stay in the same place but it will just be tracking them with the little dot and the little line I'm going to go with linked and then we can just use this title position to put the title where every once I'm going to go right in the top left hand corner like so we'll hit play it will pop in it'll track it looks really really good it's taken no time at all to do that tracking we do have some additional tracking controls within here as well as our title controls so we can change the font the size the color of the background all that sort of fun stuff as well as our line controls under here and our track point controls as well so as you can see works really well and there you go that's just a small selection of some of the DaVinci resolve packs which are available now from motion vfx don't
