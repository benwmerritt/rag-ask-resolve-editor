Hello, hello, hello. Oh, hi there. Hello. Hello Welcome So like a news reader now hello and welcome to the news tonight We've gone full podcast mode already the dog walked itself home ate a pizza and took a nap That's it from me. Good night Man, how are you Casey? Well, I'm doing really good man. I'm so glad to be here for episode two Episode two. I figured we'd be dead by now. So So this is this is actually this is a great surprise in mind. We are but in body We have managed to turn up for episode two. Yes Of the resolve creators podcast we should we should read the name and say what it is the resolve creators podcast Welcome to episode two with me Alex mr. Alex sec and the lovely mr. Casey faris. I've been described as lovely by you Just now spiffing spiffing Casey faris spiffing, huh? I don't think Americans know what that means. No It means like spiffing Brits if you're a British man and you're spiffing you have a top hat and a Coat tails and you're smoking a pipe with the mustache and you're happy You're spiffing British gentlemen. That does sound quite good a London gentleman as they call them. I'm spiffing then that's interesting You're spiffing every day is a school day. Oh man. That's awesome. Well, what are you been up to man? Give us the the haps the happy haps. Oh, I've just been doing the same old time Doing the whole youtube thing, you know that youtube life as it was I'm also working on some presets which is the topic of conversation for this week We're talking presets and everything that comes with presets and around presets and whether you should use presets and all sorts of fun Stuff so we're going to dig into that in a moment But that's sort of the main thing I've been working on working on my own little presets my magic anime Which some of you may already know about so I'll dig into that a little bit more and That's it. I had a haircut. That was a nice little change when I It looks like you actually got them all cut. I did I have I don't have that many left. I like I used to Well, every time I get my haircut my forehead just gets a little bit bigger. Oh man Don't want to get my forehead resized. No, that's awesome. So what about you? What are you been up to? Oh Let's see. I've been Optimizing website stuff been doing doing the behind the scenes things of a content creator A lot of what I do is make videos A lot of what I do is also getting to try and get people to watch those videos in various ways with emails and websites and optimization of things and I like it But it's a lot of work and it's a totally different brain Then yeah teaching resolve, you know, it's easily Missed I think about how much goes into just getting a website up and running and trying to deal with emails and if you've got a newsletter, you've got to do a newsletter I'll also try and plan videos and yeah, reply to comments. It's a whole big thing of lots of different things to do It's tough. There's a there's a lot there, but it's fun. I'm thankful to be able to do it So and your website you've been doing that for a while. Why haven't you with your courses? And that's yeah, that's been a big focus which came first I assume you're youtube and then the website yeah youtube was first and ended up selling luts actually Which is sort of like a preset. I guess Um, there it is Selling luts a long time ago. That's that's how ground control got started actually is color grading luts. Yeah, and then you quickly moved into Courses, I wouldn't say quickly. It actually took a long time. We did luts exclusively for probably like three or four years I would say Yeah, you know, that's that's kind of the nature of online business and stuff as it changes and it It changes based on the industry changes based on your um You know what you find success in and that kind of thing and I kind of saw the the luts thing Being less important. I guess then then it was um, because now we have colors based transforms and all all these really nice color management tools that Essentially makes the what we were making not so useful anymore Where you doing a lot of sort of the transform luts there just to get everything to 709 and then you can do some fancy stuff Do it? Yeah, it was a transform let it was a transform based with a Look applied. So it's a transform and a look in one and I don't know if anybody else really did that Um, I think I think we were the only ones doing that for quite a while Now, of course, you find find a lot of stuff like that. But uh, But I'm pretty sure we were we were the first one or one of the very few Solutions for that for quite a few years always innovating. Yeah always at the first What's the what's the saying first hurdle first out the gate? I don't know first gate out of the hurdle I believe yeah, it's a well known saying. Yeah, everyone knows that I'm in a similar space actually I've been setting up a website and trying to build that and figuring out everything that goes with it I have had websites in the past, but I've never really built them to sell anything or to really do anything It's always just been to have a presence on the internet that I can put my face on and go there you go I was told I need a website now. I have one. Yes. I don't know why I'm building this but here it is Here it is. Yay But now I have a reason to be building one and Previously I gave out or I sold on my presets via website called ko-fi. It was easy. It was quick it just sort of worked and It's still good to be fair. I've always liked the service But now I like I need to build a better website and I need to have a more robust e-commerce solution Threading out all the technical terms. So that's sort of in the works. It's fun as you say, but it isn't minefield There's just so much that goes into it. Yeah, there's a lot to learn about it I'm really excited because I mean when people listen to this you'll have already put out magic anime version 3 Right. Yes, indeed by the time people are hearing this it will be out It will be available to purchase and hopefully people will have purchased it. I said this last week, but if you don't you are dumb Right, I don't care how smart you are. You're dumb if you don't buy it and we'll get into why in a little bit That's one of the better tools I've ever used in Resolve. So and that's I don't say that lightly We'll talk about it. We'll talk about some of the reasons why I Created it and the journey to get to this point and all that sort of fun stuff As you say it's version 3 there have been some versions before it and they've all been free So this is the first time I'm actually selling something. So lots of pressure on me mostly by myself You know, it's it's all sort of um The pressure is coming from within. I'm just like I'm selling something. I want to make sure that it's perfect and Yeah, all that going on but it's coming out tomorrow because we're recording this on a Tuesday it's coming out tomorrow on a Wednesday and Yeah, fingers crossed it all goes well. I'm excited man I'm excited to try it out and see what the world thinks. I'm sure it will be amazing I'll tell this now as well because it will be all revealed It's the first of many so it's one pack the witch is coming out tomorrow And the idea was to get a big bundle of stuff all to come out in one big go And then I realized that I I'm only one man. I can't design and do all these things Everyone go makes exciting time. Yeah, it is. That's so cool. Well, congratulations, man I'm I love everything you make so I'm I'm excited to see that and I know the droves of of resolve fans will also be excited. So thank you very much. That's cool So while what we talk about presets, let's talk about that just a little bit more because I figured on the topic of presets Let's stay on that topic for a while. Yeah I'm good at this podcast. Love. I can't know so a little bit of history about the magic anime Just because I think it's relevant to the the whole general conversation So I made magic anime. Oh, I don't even know about two years ago I think and it was relatively simple. We just gave it out there and a few people liked it It wasn't massively popular But it did a enough for me to work on a version two and then it was about 14 months ago I released version two and it just went through the roof Essentially, it's still one of my most watched videos in that 48 hour region the video gets about No, a thousand to 1500 views every 48 hours. Um, so the video itself is still really turning crazy The magic anime itself has had 150 to 200 thousand downloads now, I think dang dude. Yeah, it's crazy. That's all it does huge. It's massive. It's that's crazy I know and it's like it's done well in terms of earnings people are really generous So I gave it out for free people have always been really generous for it as obviously as a percentage It's quite a small percentage, but the downloads are crazy Yeah, there's just huge amounts of people downloading it and they're still downloading it So magic anime v3 better be good because there's lots of people are looking forward to it But for those that don't know all it does is real simple reusable animations without having to do keyframes So if you want something to whip in you just tick a box and it whips in if you want something to spin It spins and if you want it to do something else it does something else and while it's really simple It just saves your time. Yeah, and that's what presets are there to do in my opinion. Yeah, they just they don't need to do anything fancy They just need to make your life a little bit easier exactly And that's the thing I like the most about magic anime is that you can put that on absolutely anything And it actually helps and it saves you time and I think like there are so many solutions of templates, you know You download it and you have to put in all the fonts and you have to do you have to do all this stuff first of all And so you spend, you know 10 or 20 minutes getting it all set up And then it's not really what you want and you can customize it but it takes a lot of work And this is just something you can just drop things on and or drop it onto your your logo And then it makes the logo come up or spin or whatever and it's all just super well done animations It's really really easy and man, it's just like that's the kind of thing Actually saves time even even though it doesn't feel quite as flashy and as amazing It's like that's the kind of tool that a professional will use every day Versus, you know somebody downloading a template from Envato and just being like, all right Well, I'll use this for this one project. Yeah, I'll use this for one very specific thing and then we're done Yeah, and that was the idea is everything I've always made any every preset It's just been to save me time to be honest. It's very selfish I just go this is great for me and then I realize what it's good for me I may as well give it out to everyone else or now try and sell it to people as well Because if it saves me time, hopefully I'll save other people time. Yeah. Yeah And presets I think are particularly useful for us as youtubers because being on youtube is weird Making videos for youtube is weird because you make the same video every week You just talk about something slightly different, but the format is essentially the same It's always the same which is why presets I think is so useful for us Yeah, I mean getting something anything that's repetitive if you can automate it, you know And it takes a while to set up whatever you're doing as an automation of some kind You know, you might spend two hours getting it set up or whatever at the beginning But then that saves you 20 minutes next time and 20 minutes the next time and like it multiplies and I mean, it's it's an investment, you know, and so having something like magic anime, you know I mean, dude, our editor uses magic anime probably every day to animate various things that I mean He would have to go into fusion and you know do all the keyframes and everything every time for the same thing You know, he still wants a logo to come up and you know and just kind of be there You just be there for a minute and then you know swoosh away It's just easier to throw magic anime on it and you didn't have to build it, you know Yeah, it's magic it is How many presets do you use or sort of what style of presets do you use in the resolved you? You know, let's start with the built-in stuff Do you open a project and create a timeline every time at all? Do you have a timeline built? Do you have to jump into the project settings? What's your sort of go to when you start in a project for me anymore? I don't do a ton of editing because I I'm one of those people that isn't super into editing like I do it because it's necessary But I don't enjoy it. It was like what right? How dare you? Yeah, I was doing a project with somebody the other day and they're just like, oh, could I edit it? I'm like, please Please edit it and then I will do the other stuff. They're like good because I hate doing color. I'm like great Let's work together, you know, but yeah so I I don't use a ton of editing presets other than other than stuff like like magic anime and kind of the more simple titles and templates that you know, they don't have a Pumpkin, you know spinning around and that kind of thing and you know a 3d logo swooshing at the At the screen or anything. It's just you know, really nice clean uh easy to customize titles that kind of stuff I use a lot of a personal hatred of pumpkins or it's not pumpkins in general it's it's a It's a personal being in the video production space the educational space Working with you know colleges sometimes and seeing college projects seeing a lot of beginner stuff, right? It's always the you know It's like a it's like a video on how to make ramen, right? And the first 30 seconds of the video is space and then the person's name flying at the screen in 3d letters And there's you know lens flares and all this stuff and it's just to say that it's their production company Which isn't a production company. It's something they made up just for this video And i'm like um, that's really tacky Yeah, it is you know and it's like when are you going to use that if you're not editing like literally star trek Like exactly that, you know, this is a slight divergence I'm gonna have to ask what's your opinion on intros on youtube because I have quite a strong opinion on intros on youtube I'm curious to what yours is. I think it's a total waste to do an intro um, I used to do intros and everyone hated it And then I realized why? Because you're delaying what people showed up for to tell them about yourself and nobody wants that Nobody wants you to like you're at a party somebody comes up to you and they go Did you know that uh, I am very handsome and I have many leatherbound books and it's like dude Nobody cares. You know what I mean? Although that is how you introduce yourself when we first met that is how I introduce myself Yes, specifically that way ever met kasey in person. That's his first life. Hello. I am very handsome. I'm very handsome as you can see exhibit a my face I totally agree and I think it's when you start you kind of think oh, let's do an intro and let's do a big fancy thing because I I'm the same I did it I went through a couple of intros and it's like yay looks cool and funky and then you're exactly right You realize that you just wasted 15 seconds or 20 seconds or however long and now it's just straight to the point Here's the thing. There you go. This is why you're here. Here's the stuff And if you want to know my name, it's literally written down below so you don't need to see in an intro Yeah, I think the shortest you can make the the shortest and less flashy you can make an intro the better if you can just get Right in that's good too. You know lately. I've been starting every video with just here's what we're gonna do in this video My name is kasey. This is what I do Let's get into it and it's literally like 10 seconds, you know And even then I'm just like, do I even need to put the case? This is what I do Like probably even skip that, you know It could probably just go for that because if somebody's there for what I'm talking about They're probably going to be into what I'm doing that is true seems reasonable But if it's literally like two lines or not even that if it's a line if it's a couple of words to just go I am this person and this is what I do. I don't think that's initially It's just I don't think so, you know, danced in front of a green screen and stuff flying past you like kasey farah Well, I think okay, so I have a theory here and I don't know I have done zero research on this But I bet I bet the research supports this So like we think of like tv shows, right and how tv shows Basically the older the tv show the longer the intro. Have you noticed that? Yeah, it's like a tv show from the 70s or whatever has, you know, a whole minute intro But a tv show now has a cold open, right? And it just starts and it's like I wonder if that's because people would show up at a certain time and they might be a minute late They might be 30 seconds late. They might be watching something before that They need kind of that palette cleanser of like, okay Now you're watching this show, right? And so it's like that's why we had those intros But now you're clicking you're you're choosing to specifically go into look at something When you want to look at it and so you don't really need an intro because you're already there You already know exactly what you're about to do. You did it Yeah, and actually if you're browsing netflix and you hovered over tv show and it just showed you the intro You'd be like no, I don't want to see this. I want to see the actual show. Yeah Yeah Totally agree anyways, it's not it's not really about presets. That was it. No, that's it. That's free. That's all that's a free rant right there Uh, what were we talking about? We were talking about what presets you do use. Oh, yeah, that was it What presets do you use individually? Sorry? I cut you off. Oh, it's okay. It's all right. But tansons are fun Good rant. Yeah, the biggest ones I use are like presets in fairlight Like for for voice and stuff We have a couple presets that we use the eq presets and stuff like that and we use those all the time No one has time to do your audio every time I'm gonna do that every time if you're in the same room with the same mic. Yes Yeah, we've been using the same preset for like three years and it's like yeah, that's what we do And for a long time I was doing that I was like, oh drag drag the noise reduction on and then I'll do my eq And then I realized that this is stupid. It takes me five minutes every project Yeah, and there are some fun ways that well not fun But there are some good ways that you can set presets within fairlight the kind of what it's called down the fairlight master Configuration thing is the best one. It's under the fairlight. What's it called? Yeah, you can load it by default into a timeline I think we've both talked about it before So that's really handy and you know, it just saves you time doesn't do anything flashy As you say, it just saves you the effort of having to do it every plumbing time. Yeah, what about you? What kind of presets do you use? I use my bin one. That's my main one. So I have my little bin trick Yeah, it's perfect for what I for what I do so I can open up DaVinci Resolve and I have a timeline ready to go And it's got all of my audio stuff on there I then just drop my media in and drop on the timeline and that's it. It's good to go As I said because we are youtubers we We very rarely fluctuate in terms of the resolution we need and the frame rates and this that and the other obviously filmmakers maybe Have more to think about because they need to know what the deliverables are going to be Whereas for us, it's like just open resolve and I want it to be exactly the same as it was last time And then I just put I put new video in and everything else is the same So that as much as I can automate that and keep it the same then winner perfect If y'all don't understand the the bin trick It's basically taking your project and putting it all in a bin and exporting that bin Just putting it on your desktop You can double click on that and it will open up a new resolve project with all your media and your timelines and anything That's in that bin. It's like a save default project almost But you can have multiples of those man. It is a time saver It is just such a good idea. Alex has a couple videos on that I have a video that was just frankenstein off of his video on that Yeah, there's a few people that have done similar things. I search for literally just to venture resolve template bin Or probably do the trick and have a look. Yeah, and as you say It's just the best way of getting into a project with everything there that you need Did you spot they added you can now export power bins in the last update? Yeah couldn't quite figure out the benefit really handy to back them up What I was originally I thought oh, that's quite cool. You can do this on the other and then I realized that It's like the same thing as bins at that point Yeah, so it's just purely for backup reasons, I guess backing up and sharing Yeah, I guess if you already have stuff in a power bin and you don't want to make it a regular bin Yeah, I'm sure a lot of people wanted that for whatever reason, you know You can have multiple power bins like all I get Tuesday's power bin out and have a look. Yeah, I don't know There's a lot of things about this whole crazy mixed up world. I don't understand and I don't understand the youth of today There hip-hop music and such hip-hop and power bins What about third-party stuff then third-party plugins your likes of motion array Envato elements all that sort of stuff So I I myself use Envato, but I don't really use it for that much DaVinci resolve stuff just because there's not much there and it's a bit of a wild west You download one thing and then it tells you that you need to do it's built with timelines And there's 27 different timelines and you've got to put an image on each one And you're like that's going to take me longer than if I just made the slideshow from scratch Yeah, yeah my bit meh with them. I like I like those services for the other stuff You know just been able to go and get pngs and stock footage and whatever else. Yeah, I use it for that a lot But yeah the resolve templates are a bit meh. Yeah, it's that's the thing is there's not a lot of standards And honestly that was the problem with like after effects stuff too, you know And and premier stuff and everything is everybody builds stuff different ways and you know even photoshop plugins and all that stuff It's that's true. You know you open it up and there's no smart objects And it's like you have to replace things and then you have to cornerpin your own thing You know like all this stuff and it's like wow really that's how you built that, huh? You know if you have the time to mess with it, you know that can save some time and yeah I guess with resolve it. It's only very recently really that you have the tools to do it You know other than A project which has been there for a while, but you know dl effects files for example that's only a year or so old I think yeah, I want to say it's maybe like two years old something like that And it's honestly still kind of interesting to me how difficult it is to export a dl effects and to customize it and stuff It's full like jank is actually have to go and do it totally outside of DaVinci Resolve and not use any specific tools at all For those that don't know what we're yapping on about dl effects files, uh DaVinci Resolve I don't know. What do they stand for? DaVinci Resolve effects files I assume Let's go with that makes sense to me They are essentially like macro Plug-in presets and you can package them up into a dr effects file So then you can send them to someone else and they can literally double click It will open up DaVinci Resolve and it will install this presets that it sits within the effects library For example and gives them access to everything they need and you can set the names of your different effects You can do folders. You can do little thumbnails all that sort of stuff But they are essentially just a zip you zip it up and then you have to go right click and change the file format to a dr effects There's nothing smart about it. It's just you just changed the file type It's wild to me that that's how you do it still, you know And it's not like it's that hard, but it's like man if we had a way of just like, you know Export dr effects from fusion, right? That seems like a reasonable thing To expect that would yeah spit out a dr effects file that's formatted correctly You know and saves you you know saves you five minutes every time you want to export something probably get a lot more uh Templates going on, you know what I mean? Yeah, you would I guess we could say the same about the macro editor Because it's a bit of a faf, isn't it? It's a bit like fiddling you could go You go do all the right boxes and do all the stuff and it's a bit meh You feel like this should be a much easier way of doing it even You know if you A text plus Template you've got to jump into fusion and right click and settings and put it in the right location to get it It's just all a bit of a weird solution something that would just Revolutionize the like people making templates as if they had like a template wizard, right? Where it's like, okay do this and you can connect it I mean even with even with nodes or something like you connect it to an interface in the inspector that you can build You know visually right instead of kind of imagining what it's going to be like and having to select things in a certain order And then if you do it wrong you have to open up like visual studio code and like move stuff around and it's like wow That's uh, that's a lot of work for somebody who might not be so technical, but might be great at design You know, yeah, I mean just a drag and drop solution would be perfect. Yeah, I want the text box there cool But yeah, that doesn't exist unfortunately Um, maybe that'll be the next thing that I try and make but I don't think I have the abilities for that But maybe do they do they build the interface and everything in lua? I would assume yes So there's a html. I come on what it's called some sort of workflow plug-in things which you can build now They're relatively new but yeah, it must be what could be I don't know python mainly Crazy, yeah, I don't know. I don't know these things. Well, just learn how to do all that That would be that would be great if you could you could save us alex that'd be super Yeah, I've got a few weeks until the next podcast so ask me again. I'll see how far along we are What what's nice about the macro editor and about the drfx thing is you can make some really cool stuff If you're willing to dive into it a little bit, you know, I mean, there's no end to the customization You can do for that stuff. It's there's people making really neat Interfaces and and hooking things up in a really smart ways I mean, I've learned a lot that's something I've been delving into so I've done a lot of the the back end um xml stuff to try and figure out how this works and Sorry to go back but we can't wait to the magic anime stuff this new version most of the time I spent to be fair was either on expressions Sort of doing the maths of how the stuff works Or just working on the ui working on the front end because there's there's so much you can do with these presets in resolve Which is just inaccessible within the venture resolve itself. You can't build it from the macro And they say you have to go into the back end and start messing around and Mine is about it's about 5000 lines now magic anime is and Yeah, most of it. It's just like ui stuff. Yeah, put this underneath this unless this is this so Yeah, it's a minefield. That's the level of Work that it takes to build a really nice template these days in resolve, you know Or I guess out of resolve, you know for resolve It sounds like we're going to be scaring everyone away Saving some stuff once you get used to the weirdness it can be easy You know the macro editor the front end you you can figure it out with watch a quick youtube video And you will get there with you know the basics of it But it is as you say a frustrating thing when you do it slightly wrong and then go a lot of the have to start from scratch again Yes, or I have to learn an entire programming language to figure out what went wrong That's the thing is like the things that you do every day that you know how to build infusion Like let's say you can make that into a macro infusion or you can even make that into a drfx for the uh for the edit page Without a lot of work, you know, it might take 20 minutes for you to kind of put it together and that kind of thing once you have it built infusion Um, and then you have it and you can you can reuse it and everything and it's it's not that difficult Um, we're we're kind of just talking about like the next level like if you're gonna make a robust plugin for you know thousands of people to use Uh, it takes a little bit more work than that but for stuff, you know for your company or for yourself It's just like it is it's pretty simple. Yeah, we just do the usual us thing of going How do you move this from a to b and then we ignore a to b and go what about z? Yeah Yeah, imagine a million people wanted to use this for any project and it's like well, it's it's a picture of a cat so It's a pumpkin. Yeah. No, we don't say pumpkin. We know you hate pumpkins. I do that's a little known fact Actually love pumpkins. They're great They're not that popular over here. Well, halloween's getting more popular in the uk, but not massively really do you trick or treating? I mean, I don't do you do you call it walking sweets Walking sweets. Yeah, all right governor I don't like uh, what's what's a what's a super english word for walking around the neighborhood a stroll stroll. Yeah a stroll in lolly It would you like a stroll and if I went for a stroll and lolly, I'd probably get arrested That's too bad Um But yeah, you do get trick or treat as you don't where I live because I'm surrounded by old people I live literally on a road full of oap's or their pensioners Um, so if they started knocking on my door asking for sweets again, I would be quite scared Yeah, but it's it's becoming more popular in the uk. I know you guys got mad over here It's like like we've been planning our trick or treat route for months Like I'm planning on getting satellite images and like drawing a map Like we're really serious about it. We don't even live where we're going to go We're going to go to the best neighborhood in the city to try and get the most candy Oh, so you literally drive to a different spot. Yeah, then do they not get annoyed at that? No, they don't care. They they know people do that. That's yeah people are excited about it. It's it's they're It's it's fun Oh, yeah, it's this thing that we do called fun Maybe I'm just really cheap because my mind was like I don't want to give mars bars out to people that don't live around here buying candy to non neighbors Oh, dare you No, people give up like full-size candy bars because they love halloween and they're excited to see all the kids Oh, you know, you're far nicer than we are. I think you're americans Yeah, I think we just like sugar more. It's the national sugar holiday. So Even at resolve con you the hotel guy about three beers Yeah, you get three beers. I think wasn't even halloween. It just went do you want a beer and you go? Yeah, and they go, okay Here you go. There you go What's that voice I'm a generic american bartender I can't do an american accent. So I just do your best american accent right now You need a phrase, right? Yeah, I need about could I get a hamburger, please Could I get a hamburger, please? Yeah, I can still hear it. Maybe not You maybe go like Texan or just go like proper southern but that Yeah, again, I'll probably be stepping on some toes. That's all right. I don't mind I'm very hard to offend. So you'll just have to talk to the listeners about that I'll just go with my generic. Would you like a beer, please? Oh, that's awesome I had a question Yes, why aren't there more resolve templates available? Oh, no It does seem strange and I still think it's partly due to that those limitations of making them It must be and I guess DaVinci is obviously still in its infancy It's not like after effects, you know where people have been doing stuff on that for years and years and years The the general public, you know, not the the high-end studios doing this that and the other we're relatively new It's only been what five years really since DaVinci resolved from an editing point of view It started to grow and started to become a thing. Yeah, so that's my assumption It's just the the capabilities aren't quite there or though they're getting better and the audience hasn't really matured into it Just yeah, yeah, maybe we'll see a little growth spurt Of templates one day and there'll just be a thousand out there. I don't know I mean, I would assume that'd be the way it's gonna go, right? I mean because there's more people move to resolve that's going to be more more templates available more resources available And I know that's I mean that's a big sticking point for a lot of people why they don't want to switch is they're like, well I have You can get so many templates for after effects or for premiere, you know that You know, I'm not I'm going to waste time if I move to resolve You know, at least in that way and actually the only sort of company that I know of that does that high-end sort of really polish Stuff his motion vfx They do, you know, they have their very specific DaVinci resolve packs and they're releasing those at quite a high rate So they you know, they're doing like one or two new things a month at the moment So they're really building up their back catalogue But I think they're the only ones other than You know, the only established company doing it rather than, you know, in vato or random people like me Yeah, there's there's individuals. I think that are selling packs here and there but Yeah, as far as like a big industry. Yeah, I suppose we should mention patrick. He does a lot mr. Patrick sterling He's always turning out little packs and add-ons and all sorts of fun stuff. Yeah, he's making some cool graphs like some some really good templates and everything for Just like really simple You know, if you want to add some visualization to you know, some data something like that And that's the stuff again that I think is really really Helpful because you can put that on anything, you know, you could put that on a you know a real estate video And use the same thing for a e-sports video and it It's not that hard to change the colors and change the style and everything and it doesn't it doesn't have a You know a spaceship in it and all that stuff that I feel like they try and make fancy fancy ways to do this That just don't apply to everything, you know, I'm noting all these down by the way. So casey hates pumpkin pumpkins and spaceships Yeah, all of that. Yep. Hey there So pumpkin shaped spaceship is what keeps casey up at night Yeah, it's that's my nightmare. That's I look under my bed every day. I look in my toilet before I sit down for pumpkin spaceships for the halloween spaceship Yeah, yeah, I don't I don't want that in my life. No, thanks No, no, thank you. So, yeah, I guess this is a this is just a a call to Anybody who wants to make templates man. I feel like that's that's a blue ocean right now as far as As far as resolve goes I don't feel like there's a ton out there And I mean we're searching pretty I would say pretty regularly for these kind of things Being in the industry that we're in even just a place to share them is what's missing as well There isn't you don't say where that you can go. I know convenient. That wasn't it There isn't any there isn't a central location where even if they were user generated you could you know share them I'm like your peers. Maybe somebody should work on that. Yeah, maybe maybe Hmm Giving away secrets now We we have an idea maybe If you uh, if you're interested in that how about you let us know about that.
