What's the point? What's the point of this channel? Wow. Brrr. Ehh. What up, folks? It's me. So I'm tired and a little bit grumpy today. I'm having one of those days. I'm just procrastinating. I'm just grumpy and I don't want to do anything. It's gonna zone out in front of the TV or on the PC or do nothing. But I'm not gonna go take the dog for a walk. I'm gonna film some stuff and see what happens. Oh, Billy. Right, roll it there. The big scar here, because he has to have enough race to have a big lump removed out of him. He's all right. He's doing all right, but he hasn't been out for a walk. So we're gonna take you for a walk, aren't we? Trying to go out? Come on then. Road trip. Come on, come on. So I made it. I'm out. I'm here. I'm happier. The dog's happier. He's having a great run around. He needs to be careful. He doesn't open his cut or his wound or whatever, but he seems to be doing all right. So procrastinating or procrastination, if you don't know what the word means, it just means when you're delaying something. You've got a job you need to do or you want to do, but you're just looking for excuses not to do it. That's procrastinating. You're just having a meh day, which is what I'm having today. I know I want to come out and film. I know it'd be good for my channel. I know it'd be good for me. I know it'd be good for the dog, but it's just another part of my brain which is telling me that I can't be bothered. And I just want to stay at home in front of the TV, eating biscuits, drinking tea, and just having a waste of a day. But I didn't. I got off my ass. I came out and everyone benefits. Me, I'm outside. I'm enjoying the walk. It's good for my physical health. It's good for my mental health. I'm recording stuff, which I can put on the channel. It might not be good for you if this vlog is terrible. I didn't think about that. But everyone pretty much benefits. And the dog's having a great time. So, yeah, procrastination. It's annoying. It happens. But you need to get around it. I think we're always just procrastinating now. Hang on. You procrastinating, buddy. Just want to go that way. Do you want to go that way? Or should we go that way? That way? Okay. Which way? Which way? Big one. Really? Which way are we going? Where are we going? This way? Okay, this way. Come on then. So I'm using the Tamron 28-70 to try and vlog this. I have got the little one with me. I've got the 18 mil. These actually don't look too bad. I thought this would be rubbish for vlogging. With a bit of an arm. Fully outstretched and on a tripod. But it works in a pinch. That's good to know. All right, let's keep going. Not what you want to see when you're out walking. Storm alert. Now what? It's a good job I'm dressed for a storm, isn't it? Now, before I actually came out and started filming all this, I bought on Twitter that I was procrastinating. I wanted to vlog and I couldn't think of anything to talk about or anything to do. I'm Mr Alex Tech on there. Don't really use Twitter enough, but I'm trying. So again, if you want to come and have a chat, not necessarily talking about DaVinci Resolve stuff, just get to know me a bit more. See what I'm up to behind the scenes. Follow me on Twitter and Instagram. There's some links in the description. And the man, Josh Haynes, saw my tweet and he tweeted back saying vlog about the five mistakes you've made on YouTube. So I think I'm going to jot that down and I'll make that my next vlog. I'll run through five of the biggest mistakes I've made while making this YouTube channel. So I'm going to go through five of the mistakes I've made while making this YouTube channel. I've made a lot of mistakes. I still make mistakes, but I'll try and narrow it down to five because otherwise it'll be a really long video. And it's really, really raining now. Personally, I'm not actually getting wet. I found this little spot and it's doing all right. So much rain. Oh man. I need to make a decision. Do I wait it out or do we run into the car? I'm going to wait it out, I think. Let's check the weather. Well, I was going to check the weather and see whether this forecast the last for a while or just be a short spell and I don't get a signal. So, yeah. Probably should have checked before I left really. It's too late now, innit? No. My point being with all this is if you're procrastinating, if you're having one of those meh, really mushy, muddy days where you just don't really want to do anything, there's things that you could do, there's things you could achieve, maybe go out and record a vlog like I'm doing. Even if it's just some stock footage, just take your camera with you and record some stuff or you want to learn something, you want to learn some DaVinci Resolve, maybe a new effect in DaVinci Resolve. If you're feeling meh, if you're procrastinating, just go out and do it. I promise you you'll feel better for it. Now, this is advice that I know. I know this is good advice. I really struggle to do it. If you've been a follower of my channel for a long time, I've been promising to do vlogs since I hit 5,000 subs, I think it was. I did a video saying I was going to do some more vlogs then. That was a long time ago. I really struggle to actually do it sometimes. I sit at home and just don't want to get out and don't want to make things. But I'm really forcing myself to at the minute. So I'm watching a load of really creative people just go out and make vlogs out of nothing. So that's what I want to do. Look at the state of you. Come here. Sit down. Look at the state here. Hey, here's the state here. Beautiful. Beautiful. Yeah, it's a good point. It's a good job I brought that towel. I knew I'd need that towel. Come on. Come on. Oh, she threw it. She threw it. He re-used that foot. There you go. So there you go. There's another vlog from me. I hope you enjoyed this video. I'm really glad I came out and actually made it. So as cliche and as cheesy as it sounds, go out there, create some stuff, have some fun. Let me know if you do it. I'll come and take a look. Just go out there and do. Go and create stuff. Go and just have fun. It's really easy to just sit around and do nothing because you don't feel like doing something, but just go out and do something. Anyway, that's it. I hope you enjoyed this video. Hope you enjoyed the vlog. If you want to see more, do let me know. If you enjoyed it, give me a thumbs up. Comments, feedback down below.
