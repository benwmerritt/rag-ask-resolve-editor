DaVinci Resolve Studio, that's the paid version, is the fastest it's ever been. Thanks to the DaVinci Resolve 18.6 update. Specifically, I'm talking about the DaVinci Resolve NauRoll engine. That's the AI engine which powers the software's most powerful tools. It's been good for a long time, but it's just got way way faster, especially if you're using a modern AMD or Nvidia GPU. I'm running an Nvidia RTX 4080 GPU in my system and these effects absolutely fly, especially magic masks, which were never slow, but now they feel faster and smoother than ever. So, let's run through some of them. I'm going to explain what each of these awesome studio only features do and give you a real quick demo to show you just how fast they are. We're going to kick things off with auto subtitles. The auto subtitles were added back in DaVinci Resolve 18.5 and while they were never slow, they're now super duper quick. Back when 18.5 launched, I made a video talking about the auto subtitles and they'd run it around 28x real speed, which was pretty quick. But let's see how quick they're running now on 18.6. So here I've got a 30 minute timeline. It's just a 30 minute clip, but it's all a-roll, it's all me talking, so there's a lot of subtitles to be generated here. So to run the auto subtitles, all you need to do, you click on timeline at the top and then you come down to create subtitles from audio. There's a few options you can change if you want to and then you simply hit create. Now, even with OBS running and me recording all this stuff on my computer, I'm still getting 30, what's that, 30, 34, 35 times real speed. So it's going to do this entire 30 minute timeline in like 40 seconds. 40 seconds. That's genuinely really, really quick. It's actually just gone up to 35. Oh, 35.9 times real speed and it's nearly done and it's going to have generated all of these automatic subtitles for us. And there they are, done. Now I actually use those auto subtitles within Resolve to generate the subtitles for my YouTube videos. And they're so accurate these days, I don't even check them. I just generate the subtitles, last thing I do at the end of the project, and then I upload them along with the video to YouTube and job done. And now, that's just got even quicker. So big thumbs up from me. Next up, let's talk magic masks. Magic masks are honestly probably one of my favorite features within DaVinci Resolve Studio that potentially worth the price of the upgrade alone. Magic masks just take the effort out of tracking and rotoscoping. They will automatically track people and objects. And then you can use that mask for selective color grading, compositing, putting text behind things, mask transitions, or even just messing around in the woods like I generally do. And once again, now they've just got even better than before. So same timeline as before, 4K with some 4K footage, and we're running at the full resolution. So we're going to jump over to the color page. It's this icon here to enable the magic masks. And then you get the magic mask options down here. Now you don't need to do anything fancy. All I'm going to do is draw a little squiggle over me. And then we're going to click on this icon here to enable the overlay. And the area that it's found will be marked in red. Now all I'm going to do is hit this icon to track forwards and backwards. And we're getting crazy tracking speeds 50 frames per second with this footage. This is a one minute segment of that clip. So it's exactly one minute long. And it's going to track the entire thing in, I don't know what's this, 20 seconds or so 20 seconds to do magic masks on a one minute 4K clip, 55 frames per second. Now, and it's done. Now we can turn off our overlay. And let me just right click on the nodes, add an alpha output, drag our blue to our blue. And then we get rid of this background. Now the other thing I've noticed is it's not just the tracking speed. If I jump over to the edit page, I can scrub through this. And there's no delay whatsoever. I can hit play. And it's super responsive. It's so good. Now just out of curiosity, I've got a 1080p timeline this time with some 1080p footage of this little doggo. So we're just going to jump onto the color page. We'll do a little tracky track. And then we're going to hit track. No messing around. This is even quicker. 60 something done. Let's just add our alpha output. Jump back onto the edit page. And we've got our doggo. That's crazy. Magic masks, as I said, were never slow. But now it feels like real time. It tracks faster than real time. And there's no delays, no hiccups, no issues whatsoever on the edit page. Oh, so good. Thank you very much, Black Magic. I'm very, very happy with that. That's awesome. Next up, voice isolation. Voice isolation was another relatively recent feature. And what it will do is automatically pick up on voices within your audio and get rid of any background noise. So if you're out in the street, it'll just pick up your voice and get rid of all of the general ambience and all that sort of thing. It's been really, really effective since they launched it. But initially, it could get a little bit choppy. It was actually weirdly hard on the system. Sometimes some people will notice seeing some delay once it had been applied, all that sort of stuff. Once again, it's now super quick, super impressive, and super duper smooth, like me. Smooth. So check out this clip here. Me and the legend that is Darren Mosten just sitting around having a beer. And if we have a listen to the audio, that's good after all that talking. You can hear there's a lot of background noise because we're in a busy environment. So let's give the footage a click. In the inspector, we go to the audio tab and we have the voice isolation. And it's as simple as toggling it on. You do get an amount scale so you can lower this down and fine tune it to get it perfect. Let's just leave that on 100. And again, it's super smooth. We've got no lag, no issues with playback. And as soon as I hit play, that's good after all that talking. It's basically got rid of all of that background noise. And now you can just hear our dialogue perfectly. Chef's kiss. Lovely jubbly, super smooth, easy voice isolation for the wind. But what about speed warp? Anyone that's used speed warp in DaVinci Resolve, Studio knows that it is or has always been the most taxing studio only feature. It could bring even the most powerful rigs to a standstill. But I'm happy to report this has gotten much quicker too. Now, if you've never heard of speed warp, what it allows you to do is to artificially slow down footage that wasn't shot at a high frame rate. So you can take 30 frames per second, put it on a 30 frames per second timeline, but still run it at 20% speed for slow motion. Speed warp will fill in those gaps and make it look nice and smooth. And it does a pretty good job. But as mentioned, it was always super stressful on your rig. So let's see how it performs now. So here we are, we have a 4k timeline with 4k footage at 25 frames per second. So if we go to speed change, we're going to knock this down to 20% and hit play. And our footage is going to look something like this. Super choppy because we don't have enough frames. Now all we need to do within the inspector, scroll down to the retime and scaling, change the retime process to optical flow. And this will sort of try and blend the frames together to give us a better looking piece of footage. But then we want to take it up to the next level, we change motion estimation to speed warp. Now straight away, I can hit play. It could occasionally take a little while to figure out what was going on. But now it's really responsive. We can still click around the timeline with no real issues as well. But we are dropping frames still. We're still getting 13 to 14 frames, which honestly is pretty good for speed warp, but it's not real time. But we can fix that with one quick change. So if we really quickly just change the playback timeline proxy resolution to half, no caching, no anything. Now we do get real time playback with speed warp enabled. And we can make cuts, we can delete footage, we can do a little ripple delete on there. And everything just works. Real time playback, even at half resolution with speed warp on, we's almost unheard of. And now it's buttery smooth. Well, hey, I haven't done that in ages. Mind blown. Now I want you to take a look at this footage and see if it still looks good. Does it look different to the rest of the footage we've had on this video? Hmm. What this footage you're looking at is 720p. While this video you're looking at is of course 4k. I've used the built in super scale studio feature to bump up the resolution so that it doesn't look super blur and horrible. It actually looks pretty good. This is the 720p footage. And this is the same footage with super scale enabled. Now super scale has been there for a while, but they recently made it better with a two x enhanced version, which I'm going to show you. And what it will do is sharpen up and try and artificially upscale low resolution footage. Again, it used to be quite resource heavy, not as bad as speed warp, but it did slow things down a little bit. Once again, it's got nice and quick. So we're back on our 4k timeline. I've got my 720p footage down here. And we're just going to make sure that our proxy is back up to full so we can see how it works in real time. Now we're just going to open up the inspector right down at the bottom. Super scale. This was added in DaVinci Resolve 18.5. It's much easier to access. If we enable that, we've got super scale two times enhanced. And once again, we can just hit play with no lag, no delays, and it all acts like regular footage. If we just zoom this in and hit play, you can see sort of the sharpening. You can see actually looks pretty good for 720p footage. If we just toggle that off, it becomes noticeably blurrier and we lose a lot of detail. Toggle it back on. And there you go. Super scale once again in real time. And last but not least, let's talk about some of the facial recognition features. There's actually two in DaVinci Resolve studio. There's face refinement, which will automatically pick up on faces and then track the eyes and the chin and the nose and the mouth so that you can do some dedicated retouching of people's faces. But there's also a facial recognition feature, which will scrub through your footage, find faces so that you can just pick them out from smart bins, particularly useful for like weddings or whether you've just recorded loads of different people's faces. And you can really quickly go, I want to see all the footage of the bride or the groom or important person, a or whatever. And once again, both of these features have got really, really quick. So let's start off with a facial refinement. 4k, 4k once again, and there are no proxies enabled. So let's jump over to the color page. And all you need to do to enable this one in the effects library, click on your little magnifying glass, and we're just going to search for face refinement. We'll drop that onto our node like so. And then we simply hit analyze. And again, in no time whatsoever, it's picked up the face and it's tracking this. It doesn't give you a multiplier, but this is, I don't know, two to three times faster than real time. It's scrubbing through this clip. It's a 25 second clip. There we go. Done in no time whatsoever. So we can just disable our overlay, and then we can come in and amend the texture. We can put a skin mask on there. We can change the eyes, the lips, the brush, the forehead, the cheek. There are all sorts of specific facial retouching, and it took no time at all to track. It's so good. Look how pretty I am. Next up, the facial recognition. So to enable the facial recognition, first thing you want to do, click on the ventry resolve top left, go to preferences, go to user at the top, editing, and just make sure that you have this automatic smart bins for people metadata turned on because we're going to need that in a second. Once that is done, I'm going to go to my bin. So this is a bunch of sort of wedding footage of these bride and groom around a church and whatever else. Now we can highlight all of this footage, right click, and there's an option to analyze clips for people. If we give that a click, it's going to run through all of those clips. Again, no delay. There's eight clips. It's done it in, I don't know how long that was. Super quick. And now we go, this is the person's name. So I'm just going to put bride. This one is groom. It's missed. This one, it's struggled with that angle. But now we've got bride. There's all the shots of the bride. Groom. There's all the shots of the groom. If we just close this down, within our smart bins, we have people. We expand that and we can see bride and groom, and it's just filtered out all of the shots. So we know that this shot here will have the grooming. This one will have the bride in job done. Super quick. No time at all. Happy days. It's so quick. And these speed improvements just go to make DaVinci Resolve Studio even better value. It's been good value for a long time. And all of these features have been really awesome to use, simple, quick, all that sort of stuff. But now having everything work in basically real time on the timeline, with no hiccups and no delay and no lag, and having everything track and whatever at two, three, four, up to 50 times faster than real speed just makes the whole process that little bit sweeter. If you've got any thoughts or feedback or anything else you'd like me to try or demo, make sure to let me know in the comment section below. Thanks ever so much for watching. Take it easy. I'll catch you next time. See ya.
