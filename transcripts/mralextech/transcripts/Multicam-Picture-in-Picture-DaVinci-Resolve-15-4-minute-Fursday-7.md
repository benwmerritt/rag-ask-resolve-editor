What up folks, it's Alex here, right real quick bonus tip video for you today. Just going from work made myself a coffee There's reading through my YouTube comments and George Adams and Robbie Venters have asked if you can do picture-in-picture with multi cam footage Ie can you synchronize multi cam footage and use one of them as a picture-in-picture for the other one and the answer is Yes, you can and in this video. I'm gonna show you how So Here we are folks we're in DaVinci Resolve and we're on the edit tab now I've already created my multi cam clip, so I've already synced everything So now what I'm going to do is grab it from my media pool and add it to my timeline Get it in the place. I want which is there and then what I'm going to do next is just do the exact same thing again So grab multi cam but this time I'm going to put it on video to And I'm just going to line it up So they're perfectly aligned Easiest if you just do this at the start of your timeline because then you know that perfectly in alignment Now we've got two angles and then two audio angles as well Now we obviously don't really need them so what I like to do is just tidy these Audio's up by removing one So I'm just going to click on this button here, which is your linked selection Untick that and then I can delete this audio because we don't need it remember to use backspace and not delete That leaves us with multi cam audio and then to multi cam video clips Next thing I like to do is change my audio to the one I want So I'm just going to switch that I'm going to click on my video to if you've not worked with multiple video Tracks before the higher the number the ones that set on top of the others actually sit on top of each other Within the video itself. That's the easiest way to remember it. So this one here a video to we want to make smaller So it appears just in the corner. So what I'm going to do click on video to Click on my transform icon here And then I can shrink this down Place it in the corner And there you go and because we've shrunk that one it's revealed video one underneath which is exactly what we want So now if I just hit play or scrub through They're both perfectly in sync and they're in sync with the audio now from here. We're nearly done We just need to change one of the video files to show the other angle essentially. So I'm going to right-click switch multi cam angle change this to angle 2 and Now this one here is my picture-in-picture. This is my main now if I hit play There you go Both my clips are in sync and they're in sync with the audio and that's pretty much it You can leave it there or what I like to do highlight all three on your timeline and then right-click one of them doesn't matter which and click on link clips Then we can turn our linked selection back on and Then I can move one around and they all move together So now they're not going to come out of sync and we can just put them and edit them and do what we like and they'll just keep Perfectly in sync with your picture-in-picture officially out of coffee. Whoa. Hope that was useful As always like comment subscribe if there is something you'd like to see and do comment below If I have the ability to show you how to do it.
