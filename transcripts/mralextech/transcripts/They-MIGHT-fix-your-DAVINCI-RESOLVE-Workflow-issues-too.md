Irritates my nervous system much like snake venom and there's problems and let's talk about that there was Casey from camera conspiracies And he recently made a video called top 10 worst problems in DaVinci Resolve Still in 2022 and he's having some issues some little workflow issues with DaVinci Resolve now some of these are proper problems Others are workarounds or a little workflow tips which can help to get around them So I figured I'd hop on make a little video and try and help out if I can this whenever I drag things in here It should be in order Same order here, but you see this first file Not there is it so this first one looks just to be a simple sort order issue Your windows file explorer was done alphabetically, but as soon as you import it into DaVinci Resolve It will be sorted by the sort order of your media pool So here I've got seven 201 to seven to 16 and they're all in order Whereas if I open them up into DaVinci Resolve, we've now got 11 five nine 13 It's all over the show and the reason is this sort order So if we click on this at a like on up here in the media pool We've got sort mine are currently being sorted by duration Which is why they're all over the place if I simply change that to file name now We've got 201 to 216 in alphabetical order exactly as we would expect them to be But while I'm here, I've got two other quick tips one You can import folders into your media pool from windows makes life a little bit easier And number two you can actually pop out your media pool So let's just run through that real quick. So here's my folder what I tend to do I'm going to go back one I'm going to go to this original folder rather than adding the individual file So what I'd like to do I'm just going to click on the raw vlog folder Drop this into the media pool over on the left where the bins are and what it would do is just replicate The file structure that I had within windows. So I've got my raw vlog I've got new and I've got everything within there. So that's kind of handy I always make my file structure within windows first audio video pngs whatever and then drag it in I don't know where everything is on my raw vlog right click I'm going to open as a new window and that will open this So this is your media pool but in its own window. So then I can just close the media pool And if I just auto tab on my keyboard, I can switch between DaVinci resolve and this media pool folder This can go anywhere can go on a separate screen. So at any point just grab plonk it on there job done I've still got my full screen. I've got to open up my effects library have it up there Do what I want to do switch over to my media pool again grab this one dump it on there job done if I want to do multiples I can and it will this time work in the right order Because it will be using the source order of that detached media pool Why can't I change multiple clips at a time? I select them all change clip speed. Oh Oh, just the one, huh? Yeah, it's annoying that you can't simply highlight them all and change it But again, there are some sort of workarounds There's a couple you can do with them the media pool and then one which you can do on the timeline Now one of the benefits of having this detached media pool is you can have it much wider So you can actually see I've got my fps column here If you don't see that you can just right click on the column headings and then you can choose all the data items that you want to see Turn off all the ones that are irrelevant. I haven't actually done that yet But you could just keep resolution and fps for example So these are all 25 fps, but I do have some things in here which are 50 So I want these to be 50 percent if I right click Within the media pool go to clip attribute and then I can simply change the video frame rate 225 and then it will play back at 50 percent speed when I add it to the timeline But it's still a bit of a pain to find all of my 50s. So there's a couple work around here, too There's actually a magnifying glass at the top of your media pool. Give that a click you get the search at the top There's a filter by and I can just change that to fps type in 50 And then I've got everything that's 50 within there I can highlight it all right click Clip attribute and then change it, but there's a better option. It's called smart bins I've actually made a video about smart bins before so click it. It's around here somewhere Go have a watch of that but a real whistle stop tour to show you how it works within your media pool You've got smart bins now by default you won't actually have any what you want to do is just right click and you add a smart bin And smart bins do this these are the ones I've created in the past. So here I've got two folders 25 And 50 So if I go to this 50 fps what it does is anything that's 50 fps will automatically be filtered into this folder Any project future old any project I create I import my media and this will automatically filter anything that's 50 frames per second So I can just go in here select them all right click Clip attribute and set them all to 50 percent if I go to my 25 here's everything that's 25 You can do this for resolutions Framerates loads and loads of different stuff to create them really simple. We just right click add a smart bin Give it a name. Let's say I was doing some for 60 fps. So I can put 60 in there We've got media pool properties. I want to change file name to Frame rate is Whatever I can select the frame rates from here. I'm going to go with 60 and actually in the background You can see it's already done the filtering for us now before you click create Make sure you tick this show in all project box because you can't actually come back and do that retrospectively But once you've done that hit create you'll get this 60 fps folder and it will just filter out everything that's 60 At any point you can simply right click go to edit And then make any different amendments within here one of the important ones to bear in mind There's a little plus over the right give that a click and then you can add multiple criteria So I can change frame rate to resolution. Let's say I set this to 1920 and 1080 and then this would just filter everything that's 60 frames and 1080p easy peasy Done now if you don't want to do that you want to do everything on the timeline I'm just going to grab these two clips that are 50 drop of them on here If I give this one a click I'm actually going to do this in the inspector because my scaling goes weird, but I'm going to go to speed change change this to 50 Done so this is now playing at 50 percent If I then just click this one on the timeline hit control and c to copy Click this one or any others if I had multiple I could just highlight them all and then hit alt and v You get this paste attribute Then you just need to make sure to tick the retime effects down here and ripple if you want it Click on apply and then it will just change anything you selected to be the same 40 or 50 percent Whatever you need it to be and then I move The clip and then press play and it's creating Keyframes as I'm doing that and it does do that most of the time, but when it doesn't it resets It just resets back and it won't create a new Keyframe. Yeah keyframes are weird on the edit page. They just are always have been not the easiest thing to do Black magic really need to improve the way that keyframes work on the edit page Just it could be so much nicer and so much easier to use now this specific issue that you've got I didn't know was there I figured out what it is. It's kind of stupid. So let me show you We'll add my keyframe And then if we play forward grab it we can move it around and we get this little line to show that we're adding the keyframes We can move across Move over here and this is all working as you'd expect it to and then if we went back and hit play It's going to follow that line with all of our keyframes Now the oddity the issue you are having if I add this keyframe here, and then I move my playhead I'm going to drag this that one's worked now I'm going to move my playhead to the end and let's say I want this to be in a different location Now this is the thing that's weird You what you need to do is make sure you click on the image not on this big dot in the middle Watch my playhead here the playhead is here at the end if I click this center button It's going to move my playhead to the previous keyframe when you click on the actual little white dot It thinks you're selecting the last keyframe up. Bing. So then if I try and move it We're moving the old keyframe not the new one we want to set So if I go to the end now don't click on this center dot click on the actual png Anywhere literally anywhere else but the center move it then it works I don't know why it does that when you click the center, but click anywhere else. It seems to work I think that's the issue. I replicated it that seems to do the trick. So hopefully that fixes that one as well And what the hell is your problem with moving multiple clips around on my timeline? Why does it jump up like 15 spaces? I can never get it to just go Yeah, this one's caught me out a few times as well Again, I don't have a fix for it if you're using your mouse and moving it around it does weird things You can use keyboard shortcuts which do make life a little bit easier, but it's still not perfect So I mean, let me show you what I've got more. We'll see if it works Hey Now once that's selected hold alt on your keyboard and you can use the up and down arrows to just flick it up Single tracks it does make life Slightly easier because then you can just go up and down to get it in the right place Now a separate tip, but it's worth mentioning here If you do want to use your mouse, would you forgot these highlighted hold shift and then you move up and down You can't do any lateral movement So it'll be in exactly the same place just up or down a track and then it's a little bit easier to move it left and right So kind of works if you move for one second outside of the timeline spot Your clips are gone forever. Yeah, come across this one a lot down have a fix for it. It's annoying I would like this one to be fixed as well too. Please black magic because yeah pain in the arse Why can I apply multiple transitions? I wanted warps on all of those. Why do I have to do it individually? Ah this one I do have a bit of a fix for there are different things that you can do with transitions Now the first one setting is a standard transition find any transition within here I'm going to go to this arrow iris set as standard And then if we just click this edit point I can hit alt and t and it will add that video transition to that point So I've got my arrow iris here like so Now the same thing applies for audio transitions. So you can see I've got crossfade It's got the little red marker for that one same thing select your edit point this time hit shift and t And that will add just the audio so shift and t to add just audio Alt and t to add just video or control and t to add both your standard video and standard audio transitions Now that works if I select multiple So I'm going to select all these like so control t and it's going to dump them on there like so Now another solution if you don't want to set your standard Highlight a bunch of edit points within your effects library go to video transitions Right click on any of the transitions and you can add two selected edit points and clips and it will just dump them on Now something I've noted wouldn't you've added one as a favorite so you can see my additive dissolve here I've already got it set as a favorite so it appears in my favorites down here Doesn't work for them. You can't right click on those for some weird reason Now another real quick tip while we're here once you've added one to your timeline There is another way to really quickly duplicate them simply hold alt click drag to another edit point And you can just make duplicates that way which is just a little bit quicker than having to click and drag from your effects library Every single time next one bringing two pictures in at a time Say I want to do that. I just download a couple clips boom two pictures Why do you meld them into a double? What do I do with that? This is an old one which has been catching people out for a long long time It's actually kind of logical why it's there Things like cinema dng basically come out as loads and loads of different still images But you want to import them as a video import it It would find the sequence and do the rest for you So that's kind of why it's there But yeah, it does trip up when you've just got a bunch of images or photos whatever that are named in sequence And you want to import them it starts to do weird things now You can actually turn it off, but it is inconsistent honestly sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't so it's worth looking Hopefully it'll fix it. But yeah, it's a slightly odd one sometimes it does like to screw things up So you can see I've got one two three here It's going to do the same thing if I try and drop it on the timeline It's going to give me one file and I've got my one to three jpeg within the media pool Now interestingly you will note that if I drag them into my media pool directly It doesn't do that. It just says one two three rather than doing the combined file So you could do the drag and drop sort of solution as we ran through in point number one So actually change it just hop over to the media tab, which I know not everyone uses So you have to just hop in here Make sure you've got your media storage open over here You got these three little dots frame display mode auto individual sequence if you just wanted to do Individual just change it to individual then in theory it should always show you your three images rather than separately Now even though I've got that set It does still seem to want to do the same thing. It's still going to give me this one to three So yeah a bit of a faff you do have to import it to your Media pool first before adding it on so meh kind of our half a fix there But hopefully some of the other points will have helped to leave you out of issue just a tiny bit Maybe hopefully So it's like boom. There's a gap at the bottom You can't go lower than whatever that number is 86 40 Why the hell is there a limit on how far you can move a file? Yep, didn't know about this. This is an issue. I to be honest. I've never encountered it I've never had to move things past that point. So yeah, it is an issue. You can only move to 86 40 You could sort of try and compound it and then move it again, but that's a bit of a faff as well So Yeah, that one needs to be fixed. So if you're taking note black magic Take a look at that one now. I've combined in the next two together But look, some of them are just not I already linked that But it wasn't it didn't hold link They unlink somehow. Hey, whenever I bring that external file in even though it's the same ass length It's always one frame off Just line up your piece of shit. Now the clip's not linking. I don't have an answer for that. Does it like a bug? Hopefully that gets fixed But the clips not linking and the audio sync issue can kind of be resolved By actually syncing the audio within the media pool instead This is the way I do it. All my stuff is recorded with separate audio as well And I sync everything within the media pool. It's generally pretty reliable. Generally pretty consistent And yeah, this is my go-to method. So I've got my detached media pool. Let's import a new folder I've got this one fast noise. We'll shove that in there. Now you can see I've got Basics mp4 and basics. Wow. So I need to sync all of these up Now it doesn't actually matter that they're named or the same. They don't have to be that's just for my own sort of name Instructure all you need to do within that folder. So I've got loads of them to do I don't need to highlight anything. I simply right click Autosync audio and then I've got based on timecode based on waveform and then the option to append as well So for this example, I'm just going to do based on waveform and append. It's easy to see what's going on And what it's going to do is just analyze all the audio and all the video within that bin and try and sync everything up So you don't need to highlight them separately or do anything you can do more in one big go It's going to throw me some errors because some of these is just audio without any video We've got some pngs. So I don't care about those now if I grab let's just go with this basics Put this down here because we appended we've actually got a bunch of different audio So I've got the original baked in at the top and then I've got the WAV Audio the external audio at the bottom now what I could do I'm going to hold the alt key So I can click on the audio separately without selecting anything else or delete that one Delete that one and then I can just move that up. So we've got this audio now That's the append now. That's handy because you can see all the different tracks Instead, let's open this up If I simply went to audio sync based on waveform without the append grab a different one Let's go with this depth mat one rather than giving us the additional tracks It's just going to dump it on there if we hit play That's looking pretty good. Now. That's kind of like a soft overwrite. You can still get the original back So I'm going to open up this media pool again go to my depth map video Right click come down to clip attributes Go to the audio tab you can see here. I've got linked channel within the source channel Click that drop down you can see all of my embedded channel. So that was the original audio This is my new one. So if I wanted to get it back, I could just go back to embedded channel one Click on okay, and it will change back to the original audio. So there you go Hopefully that helps some people out that are struggling with the same issues or helps my fellow youtuber out as well Thanks for watching.
