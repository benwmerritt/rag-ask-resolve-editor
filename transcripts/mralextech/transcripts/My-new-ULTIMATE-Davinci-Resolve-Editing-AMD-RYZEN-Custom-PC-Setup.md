This video is sponsored by scan.co.uk in partnership with AMD Ryzen. This is my brand new AMD Ryzen 5950X powered scan 3XS workstation. Look at it, it's an absolute beast. I've had this a few weeks now and it's become my main work gaming and video editing workstation. This is the monster box it arrived in. It was really well packaged and packed with polystyrene to keep everything safe and secure. All the additional fixings, cables and manuals can be packaged away in their own little packet and you get this nice little printout to confirm the PC has passed scans mandatory 3XS 24 hour burn and 88 point quality control procedure. Now before we put this beast to the test and I'll show you exactly what this thing is capable of, let's first run through all of the specs. At its core we have the top of the line AMD Ryzen 5950X. That's 16 cores, 32 threads running at a base speed of 3.4 gigahertz with boosts up to 4.9. It's up there as one of the fastest off the shelf consumer level CPUs you can buy right now. We get a Cinebench multi-core score of 26379 putting it right up there towards the top of the table. When using the Blackmagic RAW speed test at 8K 12 to 1 compression we get 42 frames per second just using the CPU. Which means in theory at least without using any hardware acceleration purely using that CPU would be good to edit 8K Blackmagic RAW at 24, 25 and 30 frames per second. That CPU is called by a Corsair H100i RGB Pro XT all in one which scan have actually customized to show their 3XS logo instead of the default Corsair logo which I think is actually a really nice touch. Now moving on to graphics and it's pretty hard to miss this thing is packing an Nvidia 3090 by EVGA. That's rocking a whopping 24 gigabytes of GDDR6X video RAM which means no more out of GPU memory errors for me. Hooray! But as you can tell it sure is thick and that's thick with two C's. This is a big chunky boy. In fact it makes my old RTX 2060 look like a bit of a toy in comparison. There are three fans to keep it cool and an RGB strip on the side which isn't going to be to everyone's taste but it's pretty much a given these days so I don't mind it too much. And that's combined with 64 gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance DDR4 32 megahertz RAM. Thoughtfully that's just two 32 gigabyte sticks so there's room to crank that RAM up to a whopping 128 gigabytes total if you so wish. Now 64 gigabytes is absolutely plenty for 99% of people it's more than enough for 99% of the work that I do but you can't have a big rig like this with two empty RAM slots can you? So of course I will be throwing in an additional 64 gig sometime soon to take me up to that 128 gig just because you've got to really be rude not to. All of that is mounted on this lovely ASUS ProArt B550 creator motherboard featuring dual PCIe 4.0 slots to allow for a dual GPU setup if you so wish and dual M.2 sockets for super fast NVMe storage drive of which we have two. Both are one terabyte Samsung 980 Pro NVMe SSDs. One of those drives I'm using for my operating system which is Windows 10 Pro but can be upgraded to Windows 11 if you're feeling brave and then the other one terabyte NVMe I'm using as a scratch disk for all of my media when I'm doing any sort of video editing. Now only one of those slots is PCIe 4.0 while the other is PCIe 3.0 which means that one is slightly faster than the other. On the main 4.0 slot which I'm using for my OS we get write speeds of 4400 megabytes a second and read speeds just shy of 5500 while on the 3.0 that drops a little but we still manage over 3000 megabytes per second for both read and write. All of that equates to super fast transfer speeds, really quick load times and never having to worry about the storage drives being a bottleneck in your system. And while it is undoubtedly fast two terabytes isn't actually all that much for some of the file formats that we use in videos these days so fortunately they've also thrown in a four terabyte Seagate hard drive as well for any additional archiving and backups. You've still then got three SATA ports remaining to add any additional drives if you so wish. I've added my own one terabyte SSD for resources and games and another three terabyte hard drive for backups giving me a total of 10 terabytes of storage still with one SATA port left over just in case. For connectivity if we take a look around the back we have two 2.5 gigabit ethernet ports, dual Thunderbolt 4 type C port, four USB 3.2 Gen 2 port and lastly two USB 2.0 ports. If we flip this around and take a look at the front of the case there's an additional two USB 3.2 ports and then one USB type C port as well. Now this lovely case is a Fractal Mesophyte 2 and it is also a pretty big boy. Aesthetically it's got a nice clean black stealthy look to it which I personally really like. Up front we have an angular mesh front panel which not only looks great but it's also great for cooling. It can be opened up for easy access to the nylon filter. Behind that mesh we have two 140 mil fans to draw cool air into the case with another 140 mil fan to exhaust out the rear plus the two 120 mil radiator fans for that all-in-one CPU cooler. In keeping with the professional stealthy look there's a solid side panel which helps to keep the RGB to a minimum with only this slightest RGB glow visible through the other mesh panel located on the top of the case. Now all of those mesh panels and the big fans help to keep this thing cool. At idle the CPU sits at a chilly 35 degrees C with the GPU resting at equally relaxed 45 degrees. Now if we give it a bit of a push by exporting videos, running games or even extended stress tests the 3090 sits comfortably in the mid 70s while the Ryzen 5950X straight out of the box sits happily under 60 degrees. Now of course it isn't silent a big unit like this is never going to be but honestly it's not distracting at all during normal use. Obviously the fans do start to become a bit more audible under heavy load and the GPU and that CPU cooler especially do start to get a little bit louder. I keep mine under my desk so it's not too obtrusive but if it was on the desk right next to here it certainly would be noticeable. Last but not least to power all of that goodness is a Corsair RM 650X power supply. Yep you heard me right all of that is powered by just a 650 watt power supply. Now that was my biggest reservation once I saw the spec sheet for this build. I didn't think 650 would be quite enough to comfortably power these sort of components but happy to report I was wrong. It's been absolutely faultless during the handful of weeks that I've been using it. I've had no crashes no blue screens absolutely nothing it's been flawless. Now if it was to crash or have any other serious problems at all it is all covered by SCAN's 3xs 3 year warranty. So how much for all of this? Well spec as it is is going to come in at just over four grand so it's not cheap but it is an awful lot of PC. Yes you could build it for cheaper if you were able to find the parts for RRP or less but in today's climate you're really going to struggle to do it. I'm all for building my own PCs I've built my own PCs forever this is one of the first pre-builds that I've ever owned but in today's climate it just makes sense even financially. You add in that three year warranty and then buying a pre-built system in 2021 or in 2022 actually starts to make a whole lot of sense. Right enough of all that let's shove it back on my desk connect it all up and I'll show you exactly what this thing is capable of. Haha we're all set up and ready to go now all of the tests I'm going to show you have performed in Da Vinci Resolve Studio 17.4.3. I've got no caching and no optimized media enabled I have cleared the cache as well just to be sure and the timeline proxy mode is set to full resolution and less otherwise stated. I'm using the latest Nvidia Studio drivers and all of the footage is being captured separately on a dedicated capture card. Right with all that out of the way let's take a look and the first example we're going to have a look at is this timeline here this is a full 4k so 4096 by 2160 resolution timeline at 25 frames per second all of the footage on set timeline is the same resolution 25 frames it's h.264 422 10 bits from my Panasonic Lumix S5 there's lots of b-roll a few titles or that sort of thing and we can whip around this timeline with no issues no delay no problems whatsoever if we choose any points and hit play we'll be able to play this back at 25 frames with no issues at all we're going to give this piece of footage a click here and then hop into the color page I'm just going to go in and add a new node before there and we're going to come to our temporal noise reduction and we're going to add some noise reduction so I'm going to add five frames we'll leave it as it is crank that up a little bit bring the motion down we'll hit play and straight away it's going to jump straight up to 25 frames per second with no issues whatsoever we can even then go to the motion estimation type change that to better hit play and again it's just going to jump straight up and have 25 frames per second no problem whatsoever so 4k footage on a full 4k timeline 25 frames you're not going to have any real issues using the temporal noise reduction even if you change the motion estimation type to better you'll still get flawless playback and no real issues at all so let's try a few other bits I'm just going to remove that node we'll reset that and this time we're going to use the magic masks so we're going to hop into the magic mask area we're just going to grab the pen tool and we're going to draw across me like so and straight away it's figured me out it's highlighted me in red now I'm going to click this at like on here and that's going to just track me throughout this clip now there's no frame rate counter here but you can see this is tracking me way faster than real time two three four times faster than real time maybe so that's doing a really really good job now warning I'm not going to cover much fusion in this video it's sort of a whole topic on its own but I'll show you really quickly how titles and transitions fair on the edit page so we're just going to find a section here and I'm just going to go to video transitions and obviously all of these top standard transitions will work with no issues whatsoever let's grab a fusion transition let's just try the circles for now we'll pop that on there we'll come back or hit play it's skipped a few frames first time let's try that again and then it's absolutely fine now caching is off but sometimes it does that for the first playthrough let's delete that one let's just grab a drop warp we'll try that one or hit play that one's no issues at all let's come down and grab one of my transitions the ultimate spin put that on there or hit play again that's no problems at all we'll give that a click this one's useful because it's got some motion blur effects within there so let's crank the quality up to 10 and hit play once again and still it's going to manage that with no drop frames at all so we're going to grab let's just grab this background reveal we'll pop that on there hit play and this is going to work it's only a simple one again no drop frames whatsoever let's try the call out we'll hit play again no drop frames no issues at all so some of the simpler titles are absolutely fine but there are a few which start to trip it up so let's go down and grab this one here did you still glitch and we'll pop that on there then if we hit play you can see this one does cause us to drop a fair few frames so let's see what's going on let's give that a click and we're going to open that up in the fusion page now if we just come back to the beginning and hit play down here you can see we're actually only getting five six seven ish frames per second but what's interesting if we pop the task manager up the gpu is barely running so 20 ish percent while the cpu is barely doing anything as well so nothing's actually being pushed even though we're not getting the full 25 frames per second playback which is a common issue with fusion even if you throw money at it even if you give it all the resources in the world like we have here you still struggle to get that full real time playback at 24 or 25 frames per second if you do want to know more about fusion let me know and i'll make a separate video delving into some more fusion stuff a little bit later down the line let's crank it up a notch have a look at some higher resolutions as well as some different formats quick warning if you're not a fan of spiders they freak you out you might want to skip this section so here we are back in resolve now this timeline is 3840 by 2160 so that's the ultra hd 25 frames and the footage we're using is the same frame rate same resolution and it's actually apple pro res 422 hq now as you can guess we can skip around the timeline no problems whatsoever hit play get 25 frames no issues at all but what we're going to test for this one is speed warp so we're going to grab this footage here we're going to slow this down to 20 percent we'll use this section here if we hit play you can see it's really skitty because it's playing back with just five frames a second we're going to come to retime and scaling and go to optical flow hit play we still get the full 25 frames and what it's doing is basically merging the frames together so let's now enable the speed warp and see what it does we need to give it a few seconds to have a think and then we'll try hitting play and as you can see at this resolution we're struggling to get five six frames per second now honestly that's not a surprise the speed warp is super gpu intensive 4k is really really difficult for it to do but there is a quick trick that we can try which is just lowering that timeline proxy so let's do that so now we're just going to go play back timeline proxy and we're going to drop this to half resolution and we'll see how this does so again we're just going to come back to the beginning and we'll hit play and this time around we are getting now at 25 frames per second we're getting real-time playback with speed warp just by changing the proxy mode to half resolution now that's really impressive if you've never used speed warp yeah that may seem quite simple but honestly 25 frames per second even having to adjust to the half resolution is really really impressive now we're sticking with that progress 4 to 2 hq but now we've jumped up to true 4k so we've got 40 96 that's the timeline and then the footage is the same and we've got this footage and once again we can click around we get we're running at 24 frames this time so we can click about with no delay no issues whatsoever and once again we're going to go to five frames we'll give it a bit of each and hit play and again this is running at 24 frames no issue you can change that to better hit play still no issues at all let's just change that back to faster and add a little bit of luma until we get and we're getting full 24 frames per second with the temporal noise reduction and the spatial noise reduction as well so what i've got on here this is a 6k timeline it's 6144 by 3160 we've used that same 4k footage but we've actually just layered it a bunch of different times now the first six layers actually has an open effect supplied so we've got mosaic blur we've got invert colors light rays vortex mirrors and blur now if we hit play at this first one of course we get our 24 frames the second one comes in we still get 24 frames let's speed it up a little bit we're still going at 24 the fourth one still 24 fifth one with mirrors still 24 still full time playback still full time playback still again now and it's only when we get all nine on screen at once where we start to drop any frames now what i've also done sticking on this 6k timeline i've put all of those into a multicam so now we're just going to open up multicam we can see them all in there if we hit play it's struggling a little bit dropping a couple of frames but still pretty close to this 24 frames per second we can skip through just making any cuts as we need to it actually seems to be the mosaic blur which is causing us to drop the frames as soon as we change to a different one yeah we do seem to get our full 24 frames per second so it's all looking pretty good yes it has its limits but it's pretty solid for the vast majority of what normal people are going to do with indivisible resolve now let's just go one step further and try something a bit crazy we're going to have a play with some 12k black magic raw as you can see the timeline res is 12 280 by 5 1 1 2 which is huge now the footage is the same resolution 12 288 it's black magic raw and it's running at 24 frames per second so let's just see if we can get any real time playback we just give it a click at a random point hit play it seems to drop a few frames initially and then it catches up with itself there's a little edit point here and now it's playing back smooth 24 frames per second with no issues at all we can skip around dropped a few frames just while it was finding its feet and then it's all good to go now this footage there's a little bit of camera movement i wouldn't exactly call it wobbly but there's a little bit in there so let's give that a click we'll go to video we'll come on down to the stabilization and we'll just see how long it takes to stabilize that it's not the quickest obviously it's far quicker than that when it's in 4k resolution but it is stabilizing that 12k footage on the 12k timeline without too many issues that's actually not too bad we'll let that finish and we'll play that back and we can still play that back at our 24 frames without skipping any noticeable frames let's just see if we can apply any noise reduction to that one as well we're just going to start off with one frame see how it goes increase that a little bit we'll hit play and sort of half expectedly as soon as you apply any noise reduction to that you do drop frames even with just one frame of temporal nr we're down to 11 frames a second obviously the quick fixed timeline proxy mode let's try that at half resolution and see what we get we're now back up to our full 24 frames let's just hop straight down to five and see if we can play that back not quite we're sitting about 17 or 18 so let's try three and we're still dropping frames at three but again that's 12k black magic raw on a full 12k resolution timeline well when it comes to rendering it's actually somewhat of a surprise and video rtx cards actually have dedicated rendering cores which they use when you render out things like h.264 and h.265 but the encoding cores on this rtx 3090 are either very similar or exactly the same as any of the lesser 30 series cards like the 3060 and 3070 and the same as the older 20 series cards as well which means if you just export some regular video that's been cut up and maybe colored slightly on the timeline this won't export much if any faster than my older rtx 2060 i took that original project the one i showed you my youtube project and then i rendered it out using my 3090 using the nvidia it was rendered out at mp4 h.265 with the highest or best bit rate and on the 3090 it took seven minutes and 33 seconds i then swapped out my gpu for my old 2060 did the exact same thing and that rendered it out in seven minutes and 39 seconds which is practically identical it's certainly within any sort of margin of error but that's not quite the end of the story because what happens when you take the exact same project but then you do utilize some of those gpu enabled effects well i took the exact same timeline and then i applied five frames of temporal noise reduction to every single bit of a roll within that timeline so there's quite a bit of it as well and then we just repeated the exact same thing on the 3090 that came out in 13 minutes and 57 seconds so still way quicker than real time and then i tried with the 2016 stalled and that took the better portion of 30 minutes so considerably slower and that's the reason you'd buy the 3090 not for the just straight video export speed but for all the processing power to actually render the really difficult stuff on the timeline which then does equate to faster renders but there's still one other thing to take into account and that's multitasking i took the same project as before without the noise reduction i rendered it out this time i also booted up forza horizon 5 it was flawless it didn't drop a single frame it was smooth as anything and i was able to just play do what i want while the vintry resolve was rendering out my video which means i can render videos and i can crack on with the work i can open photoshop i can make thumbnails or i can just chill out and play some games if i want to but obviously that's going to slow down my renders right and yes it did it added a whole 10 seconds to my render speed coming out in just seven minutes and 43 seconds so yeah 10 seconds it added for me to actually sit there playing forza horizon 5 for the entire time that's crazy now talking of games let's try it out with just a couple of games this is in the gaming channel but i'm just going to show you some of the frame rates that you can achieve when using a rig like this now the first thing we tested shadow of the tune radar on the highest preset with no ray tracing in 4k we managed 97 frames per second and at that 3k my ultra wide i managed 138 frames per second this time with ray tracing set to ultra again the highest preset everywhere else 4k we got a solid 60 frames per second while at the ultra wide we got 87 frames per second we then booted up forza horizon 5 to see how that fared using the extreme preset so the top graphics within the game the 4k resolution managed 83 frames per second while the ultra wide came in at 95 frames per second so it is of course an absolute beast when it comes to gaming as well ah right we're back so as you can see the performance in gaming video editing and multitasking is absolutely fantastic all across the board which you would kind of expect for a pc of this price build with these sort of components it's going to do everything that i needed to do and more for many many years to come huge thank you to scan.co.uk and amd risen for sponsoring this video and putting this ridiculous pc together for me special thanks to a guy called alistair over at scan who was my go-to he's been really awesome he's really helped to put all this stuff together make sure to stick around because i'm going to be doing loads more videos on this thing comparing it to some other devices and showing you a slightly more affordable build as well so thanks ever so much for watching take it easy and i'll catch you next time
