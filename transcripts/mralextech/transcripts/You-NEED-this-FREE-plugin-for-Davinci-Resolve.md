Yes, there's a brand new version of Magic Zoom and it's available right now. And this time around, it's faster, it's more customizable, there's some cool 3D effects and it even has buttery smooth, super easy to run motion blur. Winner, it might just be the best Zoom tool ever made. I don't know, I don't know if it is, but it's definitely the best thing that I think I've ever made. And yes, Magic Zoom is still free, but this time around, there's an even more awesome Magic Zoom Pro available, which includes things like a built-in tracker for these awesome tracked Zoom effects, where you can track someone's eye and get this kind of locked on effect. And the motion blur works, check it out, that's kind of cool. There's also a super sexy tilt shift blur effect, which is only available if you're using the studio version of DaVinci Resolve, but I'm gonna fix that in a future update. A ton of customizable effects from mosaics to RGB to highlighters and more, which can of course all be saved as your very own presets, but I've also included 65 presets as well to get you started. We've got things like this called Inner Zoom, you can put a border on it, drop shadow, any effects that you like, and even a revolutionary infinite Zoom workflow. Yes, I said revolutionary. Now, both versions are available right now from mosaicstech.com. Of course, you can use the links down in the description below. For the free version, click the right link, then you just enter your email in the box and it will be sent directly to your inbox. Then you just need to download it, double click the DRFX file, DaVinci Resolve will open, install it, and you're good to go. But why have I got to portray my email? That's why I can send you future updates if I find any future bugs, or I decide to make the free version even better in the future. But the pro version, well that's available for just $29.99, that's US dollars. All you need to do, you make the purchase, you unzip the zip, then you pick the version, you use the regular version if you're on DaVinci Resolve Studio, or there is a free resolve version if you're using the free version of DaVinci Resolve. And yes, both the free and the pro versions will work on DaVinci Resolve 18 and DaVinci Resolve 19. Now, before we actually jump into the good stuff, if you only want the free version, but if you've watched any of my stuff before, you know my freebies are usually asked for donations, rather than donating to me, if you've got any loose change sitting around, please instead consider donating to the fundraiser that's around either on the side or down below. I'm currently working with Casey Faris and a few of the other DaVinci Resolve creators to help raise money for heart support. They're a non-profit who use music to start conversations about mental health. So if you've got a few pennies sitting around, consider throwing it over there somewhere. Right, without that out of the way, let's jump into DaVinci Resolve. I'm gonna show you the free version, show you how it works and how funky new stuff is. Right, here we are in DaVinci Resolve and we are on the edit page. Now, once installed, we're gonna open up effects. We'll have the magic tool kit and let's look at the free version first. So we've got magic zoom free. Now there are two versions within here. They're both essentially the same. We've got this standard magic zoom free, which has this buttery smooth motion blur on it. It runs still really quite quick when you come to export it, but there's another version called fast that doesn't have any motion blur at all, but it can run and export super quickly. So if you don't use the motion blur, use the fast version. If you want to do everything magic zoom, use the standard one. So let's grab the standard one. We're gonna just drop this on our footage like so. Open up the inspector. We have all of our controls within here on the right hand side. And then underneath our preview window, click our little dropdown, make sure to enable the fusion overlay and you get this little X in the middle of the screen. This is the point that we're zooming into and you simply put that wherever you like, hit play, and it's just gonna zoom into that point. Now we've put this effect directly on the footage itself. You can do the exact same thing using an adjustment clip. It's entirely up to you which way you prefer. So once that's zoomed in, we can still move this around. We can just put this wherever we like. It's that simple and that easy. It will always zoom in at the beginning and zoom out at the end. But if we were to cut this in half, we'd simply have two that would zoom in and out and we can change the length, change whatever we like because it's completely dynamic and it should always just work. So let's run through your options. Starting off with motion blur. It's a simple slider. You just slide it up, hit play, no waiting for rendering. This should all run in real time. It's buttery smooth and it looks great. The slider goes all the way up to one. If you want tons, you can actually type in the number three in there, but number three is a bit much. So we'll stick with number one and it just works. And this will update automatically depending on what sort of zoom amount and the speed that you're zooming in to. So you never really need to change it. Underneath there, we've got these additional options. So as mentioned, this is a in and out, but we can change it to be an in only, in which case it will zoom in at the beginning but won't zoom out at the end. An out only, which is the same thing, but the opposite way around. A constant zoom, which doesn't have any in or out points. You can use this kind of like a dynamic zoom. And then we've got static, which doesn't really do anything, but I figured I'd put it there so people have the option. Underneath that, we've got the zoom amount and the zoom length. So by default, it's 1.5. If I increase this to say 2.5, we just zoom in more. And as you can see, we now have more motion blur because we're zooming in further. Underneath that, we have the length in seconds. So how long it takes to zoom the zoom in? We'll set it to two seconds. It's a slower zoom. Bring this under a second. It's a faster zoom. And of course, we do get more motion blur because we're zooming in faster. Now the points it zooms in, generally by default, it's at the start, at the end. We've got these in and out points. However, there's these new zoom in and zoom out buttons. So if I didn't want this to actually zoom in right at the beginning, I wanted it to zoom in at, let's say, five seconds. I put my playhead at the five second mark on my timeline and then I simply hit zoom in. You get this new control and it's gonna get to five seconds, 4.96 technically, and then it's gonna zoom in. So it's gonna sit here for the first five seconds, not doing anything at all. And then it gets to that point on the timeline and then the zoom in will occur. Now by default, it's gonna go right to the end and then zoom out or I can customize the zoom out in exactly the same way. Zoom out now and it's gonna zoom out. So you can just customize this to get the perfect zoom for whenever you want it to zoom. And then we've got some additional controls. Now, the starting zoom is, before you actually do anything, where are you? Are we slightly zoomed out or slightly zoomed in? And the ending zoom is the same once you get to the very end. The cool one though is this constant zoom. So at the moment, this is only gonna zoom in at 3.5 seconds, like so. But if we do a bit of negative zoom as well, negative constant zoom, during our in and out points, it's also gonna do a nice bit of zooming out. So this combines my magic zoom kind of effect with a dynamic zoom. So this is constantly zooming out. So when it gets to the end, it doesn't have as far to zoom out. Alternatively, we can make this a positive number and it's gonna be slowly zooming in. And as mentioned, that constant zoom will only occur between your in and out points. Underneath there, we have our curve. So this is the acceleration curve this zoom is taking. So as you can see, it looks like that. And we can customize this if we want it to be linear. Set both of these to none. Now there's no acceleration or we can customize these. Just have a play with them, do different combinations and see how they look. Next, pitch and yaw. So we can enable this pitch and yaw. I call it pitch and yaw because that's what it's called on the main transform controls. So I've stuck with that. And this is kind of your 3D effect. So I'm gonna put my little marker in the corner and this is linked to the zoom. So at the very beginning, you won't see it actually do anything at all. But as soon as it zooms in, we're gonna get this nice 3D effect. And we can just rotate this, change the yaw, change the pitch to get the look that we're going for. This works really well with tutorials. Now the cool thing with this is it's dynamic. So once you've set it, you never need to amend it. So as I come to this other corner, it's all gonna flip. So basically we're always looking into the middle. So you get that 3D effect without the faff of having to mess around and reverse the pitches and the yaws depending on what side of the screen you're on. So I made this to be just as simple and as easy as possible. It all still works with the motion blur. And as you can see, it's super quick and responsive. Next, shake. So this is a simple shake effect. As it zooms in, we're also gonna get shake. You can change the motion scale, the speed scale and customize all of the different options if you want to get the shake looking however you like. Now the new thing here, there's this throughout or we can change it to zooms only. So then the shake will only occur when we're zooming in or zooming out. And it just allows you to do kind of like a cool crash style zoom if you want it to be a bit shaky cam on the way in but then stay static in the middle. Maybe let's increase the speed so we can see the shake a bit more. Shaky shaky on its way out, done. And the very last thing, this is all designed to be a zoom in tool. But if you did zoom it out like so, if we go to this BG, you can enable a background and then you can change the background color and we can even change it to be a different kind of gradient if we wanted to and we can put on a drop shadow. So as mentioned, it's designed to be a zoom in but if you do zoom it out, you've got some colors and some options for your background as well. Boom, it's free. Download it now, have a play, let me know what you think. Next up, let's take a quick look at the pro version. Now there's actually so much in the pro version. I probably can't even show you everything in this video because it'd be way too long but I'm gonna show you some of my favorite features. First up, tilt shift. Now as mentioned, this is only available if you're using the studio version of DaVinci Resolve but it looks super nice. So I wanna show it to you. Ah, now we're getting into the good stuff. So if you've installed Magic Zoom Pro, it will exist within effects, Magic Toolkit, Magic Zoom. You'll see five folders initially. There'll be six when you've created your own presets. Quick notes before we dive into the nitty gritty. If you grab any of these pro effects, put them on your timeline. Within the inspector, there's a how to button. If you give that a click, it'll take you directly to my website and I have created a how to with some handy little guides. So rather than coming back to this YouTube video every time, you can come here. It's all categorized. There's nice kind of videos and whatnot. So you can go and check that out whenever you need it. Now most of the main tools are within this number one, Magic Zoom folder. And we have Inners, Magic Zoom, Pan, Single and Triple. And I'm gonna talk you through all of those in this video. But the first thing, let's grab the Magic Zoom Pro and drop this on our footage like so. Now this looks pretty much the same but a few minor things as the free version. But one of the main cool things with this is we also get tilt shift. Now as mentioned, this is only available if you're using the studio version of DaVinci Resolve. I am gonna come up with a solution so that free users of Resolve get something similar. But let me show you how it works. We enable our pitch and our yaw. So we've got a nice 3D effect. And if we enable tilt shift, we get this really nice, accurate, bokeh kind of effect. And we can increase this by increasing the tilt blur strength, maybe change the in focus range. Lower this even more so then it's even more defined. And the only thing you can really see, the only thing that's in focus is our point. Now because I'm a big nerd, I made this as accurate as I can. It actually links to the zoom amount. So as you zoom in, it gets stronger and stronger. So it acts kind of like a genuine, a real depth of field kind of effect. Now the angle of the blur of that kind of focal point is also linked to wherever you put your little marker. If you want to turn that off and do it manual, you can change this angle type to manual and then you can manually change the angle. However you like. Ooh, doesn't it look good? Look at it, bokeh. Mm, noise. Next up, we've got the thing which probably took me the longest to get rides. But now it's working. I think it's cool. I think it's kind of revolutionary. It's this revolutionary multi pivot, multi point, infinite zoom kind of workflow. It's really cool. Now you can either apply this directly to your footage on the timeline or what I like to do is grab an adjustment clip, put the adjustment clip over the top, lengthen it out to kind of the full area where you're going to be zipping around your screen and then we're going to go to magic zoom. Now this exists on the magic zoom pro, magic zoom pro effects and the inner effects as well. So let's stick with the standard magic zoom for now. It also does exist on fast magic zoom. So if you're not using the motion blur, you can do it on there instead. With that applied on the adjustment clip, open up the inspector. Let's just put some motion blur on this, make sure our fusion overlays on. We've got a little marker, happy days, we hit play and it's going to zoom into our point. There's also this little button here called switch to multi. Now this is where it gets really clever. We give that a click and then we get a bunch of additional buttons. Then all we need to do, we hit play and we build this up in real time. So I want to be zoomed in, let's say I'm going top left at this point here. When you've decided that you no longer want to be in that top left hand corner, you simply make a cut in your adjustment clip. Like so you can use control and B. Then you click on this second clip. So our second adjustment clip here and then we change this to be a mid. So it's currently an in, it says in in the status. I'm going to change this to be mid and it looks like nothing's changed. But on this second clip, I can then grab my point and let's say we want to be over on the top right hand corner instead. Now if we hit play, as it goes over that point, it's going to magically move to our new destination. And we can even come around and move this afterwards. So I actually wanted to be bottom left and it's going to move. We can also then come and just adjust this point. So if I got my timing wrong, I can just smidge this over a little bit, hit play, boom. We're done. Now you just continue doing that as for an infinite amount of time if you want to. So I'm going to go forward a little bit. We'll do a cut. We click on our new one. We then need to click on mid once again. Every time you do a cut, we click on the new one, we click mid. It tells us that we've swapped to A. That's just a little reminder. Now we grab it, we move it somewhere else, top right. This is just going to move across. Do a cut, click on the new one, mid. This is going to tell us now we're on B. So it'll constantly switch between A and B so you can just know that you've clicked the button. We move this one down to the bottom right. We hit play. And off it goes. You can even change the pivot speed and the point where it moves. So at the moment, this pivot is going to occur right at the very beginning and it's going to take one second. If you want that pivot to take three seconds, you can put three in there and it's going to be a much slower move. And if I don't want that pivot, that movement to occur right at the very beginning, I can put my play head wherever I like, let's say 16, and then I can set the pivot time. And then even over this edit point, it's going to chill in its original location and then it gets to 16. Then it does the move, boom, we can customize this however we like. Then once I'm done, I just do one more cut, give this new one a click, change this to be the out because I'm finished. I'm going to change my pivot timing to just be one second again. We move to a new location, let's go right in the middle and then we hit play. It's going to move to the middle. It's going to sit zoomed in because it thinks that we need to wait to the very end. I could either do a little cut just to get rid of that. Like so, or alternatively, I could have just hit my zoom out point and then it's going to zoom out just like that. The only thing you need to remember is you have to work left to right. If I was to come back to this adjustment clip here and then move something, it would break that. So you just have to make sure that you start from the left and you work over to the right. You do a cut, you make sure you hit the right button and then off you go. Next up, if that's too much because sometimes you don't need to do like a 10 minute long whipping around the screen, you don't need all of that. Maybe you just want to do a pan, a constant little movement like this, which I use all the time for kind of screenshots and that sort of thing. Or you just want to whip between three points really quickly. I'm going to show you the pan tool and the triple tool. Within the same folder, magic zoom, we've got pan and then we have single and we have triple. So single is just a nice quick way. This is basically the same as the free version. You just go directly to one point and it doesn't have that multi-zoom function. And then we have triple, which is super cool. When you put this on here, you'll get three markers. So you can go, I want this one down here, bottom left. I want this one kind of up in the middle and I want this one over in the bottom right. You work from left to right. So this will be the first one, second one, third one. And then as I hit play, we're going to zoom into this one. Then we're going to whip up to this one. And then we're going to whip down to this one on the bottom right hand corner. Now you can adjust the timing super quickly and super easily because we have buttons for all of these things as well. So in the inspector, down here, we have our zoom in and out points. So again, if we didn't want it to zoom in right at the beginning, we can amend those. I'll leave them there for now. But we also have time to second and time to third. And we've got these little markers here. So by default, it's two seconds and six seconds. It just went with something generic to get everyone started. But if we hit play, let's say I want to stay in this position until, I don't know, six seconds. I put my playhead at six seconds and then I hit time to second. And this will kind of break at the moment because our time to second and time to third are the same. So we don't really know what to do. Then we can move our playhead to the point where we want to move to our third position. Let's say it's 18 seconds and then we hit time to third. And that's it, you're done. So it's going to sit in its first position between zero and six. And then when it gets to six seconds, it'll move to our second position. We can still customize that position. We can put it wherever we like. Let's put the motion blur on because the motion blur works as well, even moving between the points. And then we hit play, we're going to get to 18 seconds and it's going to move down to the next one. Let's get rid of triple zoom. And we're going to go with the new pan zoom. So this, very similar, but you just get two points. So what's the point in this? Well, you put your two markers wherever you want them. And then what's going to happen, let's play through this a bit quicker, over the length of your clip or adjustment clip or whatever it is, it's just going to slowly move from point A to point B. And once again, of course, we can set the timing. So it's going to zoom in at the very beginning. And by default, it's just going to take ages to move across. But if I want this pan to occur at the eight second mark, I can go start my pan. And if I want it to be finished by the 15 second mark, I can end my pan there. The pan is going to occur between eight and 15. So it's going to zoom in, sit in its original position at eight. It's then going to start. The speed will depend on how long that panning timeframe is. But there you go. Now I didn't show you with the other ones, but all of these things, the multi-point zoomed, the triple, the infinite workflow, all of this also works with your pitch, your yaw and your tilt. Now this is kind of why I made this one, because this just looks super cool for kind of displaying any screenshots. I want to put this down here. I want people to be looking at this text. Then we're going to move up there and we hit play. It's all nice and blurry. We've got a 3D effect as it moves because our 3D effect is dynamic. It will switch over. The blur will follow. Fish bash bash. Done. Looks super swish. Love it. Next up, inner. So rather than actually physically zooming in, what you can do is create a little zoom point and that pops out instead. It looks really neat and it's great for just showcasing some stuff on screen really quickly. Sometimes you don't want to be zooming in. You want to raise something up. You want something to pop up. That's where these inner zooms come in. So they're working essentially the same way. All of the controls are pretty much the same, but rather than actually zooming in, you're going to get a little area that pops out, kind of like a little magnifying glass. We can use the on-screen controls to make it bigger, smaller, move it wherever you like. Let's put it on our face. And as mentioned, works in the same way. So you can just choose your in and out points. You can do a constant zoom with it as well. You can change your curves, all that sort of stuff. If we go to a new effects panel, we can change the mask. So at the moment, it's an ellipse. It could be a rectangle if we prefer. We can increase the corner radius so we get a nice curved edge. We can soften the edge. We can do all sorts of stuff with that. And then if we scroll down, we can enable a border. So we've got a nice little border on there and we can change the color. We can change all of the options. With that, we can even add some glow and we can add a drop shadow if we want to. So this is a really cool way of just going right. I won't use a look at this thing right here. Boom, done. Next, we're going to start to take a look at some of the effects. Now, pretty much every single tool within this Pro version, there's a standard version which doesn't have the effects. And the reason for that is so it runs nice and smooth. There's no stuff in the background taking up unnecessary resources. But then there will be the same thing. So there's Magic Zoom Pro and then there's Magic Zoom Pro with effects. And you can just toggle them on, customize them, pick all the different effects that you like, even start to combine them in whatever way you like. So let me show you how they work. So as mentioned, yeah, effects. You may have noticed, inner, there's an inner effects. Magic Zoom, Magic Zoom effects. So let's grab the inner one. This is a good example. We pop this on here. And by default, it'll look pretty much exactly the same. We've got a little zoomie in, we've got our magnifying glass, we move it around, off you go. But if we go to effects for this one, there's tons of different controls and different effects that we can apply. So down here, number three, inner mask effects. This will affect everything within the mask. So we can maybe brighten it or we can lower it. We can change the gamma, the contrast, the brightness, the saturation. We can enable like a colored overlay. This is really cool. If you want to highlight something in, it's kind of a yellow color or a green or whatever. You can just do that as you need to. We've got a cool prism effect, which gives you kind of like an RGB thing. And then we've got a cool dent effect as well. So you can move this around and it really does look kind of like a magnifying glass. Pretty funky. Underneath that, we've got border, brightness once again, but now we're affecting everything outside of the mask. Different colors, a prism effect, a radial blur, which I really like, especially when you're using the ellipse, which just kind of looks cool. We've got a standard blur, a mosaic blur, and then this funky sort of TV effect, which I just thought looked cool. So I kind of tweaked it and we put it in there. And as you'd expect, you can tweak and combine all of these until your heart is content. And you can do some really cool effects with it. If we quickly go to the magic zoom pro with effects, this one obviously just zooms into a point. If we go to effects, this talks you through it because these masks aren't on by default, but we go, I want an ellipse. Sweet, there's your ellipse. You won't see anything at the moment until you enable an effect. But then let's say I just want a mosaic everywhere else. We enable mosaic, maybe a border. And then what's going to happen is we're going to zoom in to that point and then we get a little circle and everything outside of it is mosaic like so. Quick warning, the actual ellipse on screen prompt is the size of the ellipse, pre zoom. So if we have a look at the bottom of the ellipse is right on this O of resolve, as we zoom in, that's exactly where this is going to be. But because we're zooming in, the scaling kind of goes off on the on screen controls. So just size it before you've zoomed in. So if I wanted this to be a rectangle, for example, and I wanted it to just cover the words to eventually resolve, I would do it before we've zoomed in, get it lined up, then hit play. And I know the venture resolve is going to be the thing we're looking at and everything else is going to be nice and mosaic who doesn't love effects. You can even invert them if you need to do some sort of obscuring, you want to blur someone out. Now doing that obviously goes really well with tracking. So let me show you how the tracking tool works. Like everything else, it's dead quick and it's dead easy. Tracking, tracking super cool. So within the magic zoom number three, tracked. We've got inner tracking and then we've got the standard tracking. We also have the same with effects or without effects. So I'm going to go for the standard tracked. Now, even with our Fusion overlay, we won't see anything because it says set the tracking before the zoom. So we need to click on our tracker tab and then we enable the tracker. And then on screen, we'll get this little box here. Now it may look slightly different depending on what version of resolve you're running, but you should get the little box on screen and you should get these little windows over on the right hand side. Now I'm going to find the point where my car comes in. Let's go with about there. We put the tracker on it like so. We hit this button here, which is to track forward from the current time and it's just going to play through and track our objects and we can see that from over here in this little window. Now this is going to go wrong at some point because the car actually goes off screen, but I don't really care too much about that. So we'll leave that running. There we go. Job done. It's gone right to the end. Now we've got this line on screen. So we go back to our controls. We hit play. By default, there isn't any zoom enabled because we need to do the tracking before we do the zoom, but now that that's all set, I can zoom this right in and we hit play. It's going to zoom in and track our subject like so. Of course, we can put motion blur on it and then we will also be getting motion blur on everything as it's tracking and we can still use our zoom in and out point. So let's say at this point I want to zoom out. So we're going to give that a click and then we're going to zoom out like so. The inner one works in exactly the same way and you can do it with all of your effects as well. It's really, really switch. Now, as mentioned at the beginning, there's presets. So everything I've shown you so far, just the main tools. You can start to combine all the different effects to create your own preset. But before I show you how to create your own, let me show you some of the ones that I've made. Presets. Under the number five preset, we open that up. There is a number one saver tools. We'll come back to that in a moment, but I've made some presets for you and as mentioned, I will customize these while I had some more in the future. But I've got blur and we've got a blur ellipse and ball. So we can put that on there really quickly. We've got everything around will go nice and blurry and we've got this kind of funky, bally kind of effect thing. And then you can come in, you can customize it, change how it looks, do all the same things you would usually do. We've got other ones like a blur rectangle mono. That sets everything outside of our mask to black and white. Fast, we've got a bunch of just super fast ones. So if you don't need all the fancy stuff, you just like, I want to go 3D top right. You can just drop that straight on there, hit play, and boom, it's all there, ready to go. We've got highlights. These are cool. These are just for like doing little highlighted areas. So we've got ellipses. We've got rectangles and we've got some nice rectangles with rounded edges. I set them all kind of as a yellowish color by default, but once again, you can go to effects and just change the color as required. Next up, we've got some panning. These are all for doing that sort of screenshot thing with tilt shift and with sort of a 3D effect. So they would just move from two points and look really nice and you can just apply those dead quickly. And then lastly, we've got tutorial. So again, these are just designed for tutorial people like you and me that just want to really quickly highlight something on screen. I've kind of made some nice borders. I've done some funky things. So you can just have a play with them, test them out, and see how you get on. Presets. Now, if that's not enough, you're very greedy. You can save presets that have all of the effects still in there. So they may run a little bit slower, but if you change your mind in the future, dead quick, you can just turn on the things that you want. Or you can run a second routine, which actually gets rid of all of the things that you don't want. Now, this is really cool because what it will do is actually delete the nodes in the background so everything can run super swish. And it will also rejig the UI, so it's dead easy to use. Let me show you both methods so you can start creating your own presets. Yeah, so two different ways to do it. If you want to do that way where you can access all of the functions later on, so if you've changed your mind, in all of the main tools, so let's go with this magic zoom pro effects. We drop that on there. There is a save tab, we go to save, and then there's some instructions within here. You need to open it up in Fusion by clicking on your little magic wand, top right hand corner, then you just give the magic zoom custom a click. You've got the same controls here. We choose the folder, so I could do a seven demo, and this is just gonna be demo, whatever. Then I hit save. It'll say completed. You may need to start to resolve to see this effect. I've got lucky, I haven't had to, so that's good. Now if we open up magic toolkit, magic zoom, I've got number seven demo, so let's just delete that from there, drag this on here. It had everything which we had amended if I had amended them, and I can hit play and it'll just work, and if we go to effects, we still have access to all of these effects. So we can customize it if we've changed our mind. If you're making more permanent presets, so ones that don't have access to be changed in the future, all you need to do, you expand preset, and then we've got saver tools. We've got all of the main tools within here, so let's just grab once again the magic zoom pro. Put that one on there. Let's say we wanted a little bit of shake maybe, and then we go to effects, and you'll notice the UI isn't as nice. It has to kind of be a bit messier for this to work, but we can enable an ellipse, and then we can say I want the ellipse to have a dent in the middle, and I want the outside to be mosaic. Boom, we've set that up. That's what we want for nice, quick access. Then we go to save once again. There's some different instructions. We still have to go to fusion, and then we have this button here, delete unused effects. We click that, and it'll tell us that it's deleted all of these things which aren't being used, things like radio blur, prism, TV, blurry, all that sort of stuff. We can then give this one a name, demo two, hit save. Same thing, completed. You may need to restart DaVinci Resolve. Let's see if we've got lucky. I wasn't lucky. Had to restart Resolve, so I can just bin this one now. Now if we open up the effects, magic toolkit, magic zoom, we go to number six, demo two. We drop that on there. We've got our nice looking shaky ball thing with mosaic, and if we go to effects, we don't have any of the stuff that we don't need, which means that this just runs super smooth, and the UI is nice and clean. So you can save as many presets as you like, and they're always available for you in the effects library. Ta-da! And that's about everything I'm gonna show you in this video. I'm super proud of this. It's taken me probably over a thousand hours. There's so many hours of gun into this to try and get this right. There may still be bugs. There may still be some issues here and there. If you find any, please do let me know. But I've worked super hard to try and make this just the best zoom kind of pack thing that I could possibly make. And I think I got there eventually, hopefully. If you've got any ideas, any other things you'd like to see, I am. All ears. So just let me know. Thanks for watching. Thank you, EZ. I'll see you later. Oh, well, I'll wait. I don't know. I'll see you next time. Bye.
