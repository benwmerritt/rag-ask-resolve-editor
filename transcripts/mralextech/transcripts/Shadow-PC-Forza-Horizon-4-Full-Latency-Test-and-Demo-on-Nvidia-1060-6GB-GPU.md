What up folks it's Alex here now I've seen a lot of questions about the latency within shadow PC So I figured I'd throw together a quick video which gives you an actual end user demonstration of the latency Within shadow now in this video. I'm using a dual-shot 4 and I'm going to be playing for to horizon 4 I will do some first-person shooters as well with a keyboard and mouse for this just a quick demonstration to get us up and running Right, so here we are in fours another camera is recording at 120 frames per second And hopefully you should be able to see the controller and the screen now I'm recording the screen capture using the Nvidia game capture now That's actually running locally on my own PC It's running at bandwidth of 30 so I'm using 30 megabits a second I can go faster with my home broadband, but I'm going to keep it 30 So it's a realistic experience for the average sort of broadband user in the UK now Make this full screen again This is running within shadow as I say and if I just go to the settings video You can say I'm running on ultra 2560 by 1080 at 60 frames per second in the top right you can see my frames per second It'll be 60 may dip every now and again, but generally it's 60. I'm using about 50% of the GPU so it's not particularly taxing on it and yeah, this is my Mustang. So let's go for a drift I Don't know if you can see on the capture, but there is a little bit of artifacting going on on the screen It's not too major. It's not distracting by any means. It's there at 30 frames first Sorry, it's there at 30 megabits But it's not two notes. Well really this is a As I say an ultra wide so 2560 by 1080 running at 60 hertz and 30 megabits connection So it's sort of a given that'll be a little bit there, but it's not too bad at all or can't drift and talk So let's part that but there you go little test I'll keep you on the brake light Now at the bottom of the screen here you can see the actual number of frames in this shot And what we're going to do is count the number of frames between the trigger being pressed and the brake lights actually appearing on screen And Here's the maths so we started at frame 48 and we ended up frame 68 68 minus 48 it gives us 20 frames now we film this at 120 frames per second There's a thousand milliseconds in one second. So if we do a thousand about about 120 we get 8.3 So every frame lasts for 8.3 milliseconds. We know it took 20 frames So if we do 20 times 8.3, that's a hundred and sixty six milliseconds from input to Displaced to make sure it was a fair test So I also ran it a few extra times using different buttons and I came back with pretty consistent results This is for the Running locally on my PC. It's our identical ultra same resolution 60 frames per second Here's a quick direct comparison between the local PC and the shadow PC will leave this run for a second so you can have a good look And Just for transparency, we're also going to do the same latency test using the local version of forza Exactly the same math as last time we started at 90 finished on 100 that gives us 10 frames 10 times 8.3 gives us 83 milliseconds from input to display Let's have a look at the results on my local PC. There's 83 milliseconds and on my shadow PC. There's a hundred and sixty six Now remember that's all the way through that's from input to display So what does all that actually mean? Well fortunately the guys over at display lag calm have been doing God's work and they performed a very similar test Now this test is from input to display and they're using an actual monitor Rather than a TV and they've tested some ps4 and some Xbox one games Now we're going to focus on one in particular and that's forza horizon 2 on the Xbox one now that comes in at 149 milliseconds of latency We're at 166 using shadow now that difference of 17 milliseconds is about one frame at 60 hertz So we're one frame behind now if you was play forza horizon 2 on a TV Really, you've probably got to add about 20 milliseconds on top of that plain forza horizon 4 on shadow with a decent monitor It's practically identical to playing forza horizon 2 on next box one on a TV For one last quick bit of context I went over to human benchmark calm to test my own reaction times You simply click the mouse when the banner goes green now after five attempts, which you're seeing now I Came out with an average of 265 milliseconds I performed the exact same test using my shadow PC And I came up with an average of 310 so 265 milliseconds versus 310 milliseconds giving us a difference of 45 milliseconds and that's it I hope this video was used before you and has answered some of your questions Honestly that additional latency is Barely noticeable at all in something like forza when you're chilling with a controller now I'm actually that is slightly more noticeable in first-person shooters I personally have destiny to wildlands CS go if there's anything else you'd like to see pop a comment below And I'll see what I can do honestly though shadow is very very impressive I'm based in the middle of England in the Midlands and the data center I'm using is in France If this video was useful like comment and subscribe pop comment below if there's anything in particular Shadow related that you'd like to see stick around for some more shadow content in the new year. Thanks for watching Take it easy
