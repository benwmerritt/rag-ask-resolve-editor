Compound clips. Just think of it as a way of turning multiple individual things on your timeline into one nice easy to manage thing. It's like putting all the individual elements into a box and then you can just manipulate the box instead. It can help keep your timeline tidy. You can make backups of things. It makes it easier to duplicate things and you can use them to create some creative effects too. So let's open Resolve and I'll show you how to use them in this super quick five minute Friday video. So let's have a look, shall we? So here we are on the edit page and I've got this example set up. So we've got a PNG, a title and then just a couple of clips. Now we could select all of this together and then just drag it around or duplicate it, but it is really easy to accidentally knock something or mess up your timing. So instead we're going to turn this into a compound clip. So all we need to do, we select everything that we need. So just going to click and drag. We can even select the audio. Then we simply right click any of the individual elements and then select new compound clip. Give it a name. I'm going to call this intro and then click create. And that's going to bundle everything up into our compound clip. So you can now see it's just one individual thing rather than multiple different things. It's called intro because we called it intro and we've got this little icon, the bottom left hand corner. That's the icon for compound clips. So we know that it's a compound clip. We can then simply click this one individual thing and move it around the timeline wherever we want, which is just much easier to manage. If we want to duplicate it, we can give it a click, hold the alt key or option if you're on a Mac, drag and we can make a duplicate of it too. So we can put it anywhere on the timeline. Again, let's give it a click. So it's highlighted in the inspector. If we zoom this out, you can see we're zooming out everything. So the clips underneath the title and the PNG because we can treat everything like it's one individual thing. This is really useful if you're trying to do a picture in picture or a face cam style thing. You can put it in the corner, put everything underneath and job done. This is also really cool if you want to apply an effect to multiple things. So if we went to the open effects and let's just for this example, grab one of the blurs and put it on there. It's going to affect everything within the compound clip so we can blur all of the individual things. So let me just reset all of that. Another really cool thing with these, let me just delete this from my timeline. Usually at this point, you may panic because you've just accidentally deleted your intro, but with a compound clip, you don't need to worry. If we look in the media pool, you can see we have intro and it's got the same little icon. Whenever you create a compound clip, it will automatically put one in your media pool. So then we can just grab that, bring it back down onto our timeline and we're back to where we started, which is how you can use these compound clips as a real simple method of just backing up sections of your timeline. If you wanted to get all the individual elements back, we simply right click on the compound clip on our timeline, we go to decompose in place and then using clips only and it'll just open the box back up revealing the PNG and the title and the individual clips. The cool thing with that, even though we've opened it up, we still have the intro compound clip within our media pool. So we can still grab the individual thing and put it back on our timeline as we need to. And that is the core function of a compound clip. But what you can also do is dive into that box and adjust all of the individual elements within the box without actually decomposing it. So we've got our compound clip on our timeline. Now the simplest method to do this is simply right click on the compound clip and you go to open in timeline. This will open a new timeline. And what we're doing now is just editing everything within the box. So if you wanted to, let's say, just delete this PNG, we can do to get back to our original timeline down in the bottom left here, you can see it says main timeline intro. If we double click on main timeline, it will take us back to our original timeline. And if we look at the compound clip, you can see now we no longer have the PNG. Now there is actually a better way of doing that the way that I like to use just above your timeline top left is this icon. This is your timeline view options. Give that click. And then you need to enable the stacked timelines, which is our top left icon here. And now you get this new little bar at the top here. And you can see I've got my main timeline open. So now what I can do if I right click on the compound clip, and we're going to open in timeline, we get a new tab. So this intro tab here, this is inside our box. And let's say we want to just delete the text. And then we can simply hop back to our main timeline. And we can see the compound clip. So we can see that it no longer has the text. And you can really quickly hop back and forth. Let's grab a PNG and put it back on here. Let's just grab this one, do whatever we need to do with that. Go back to our main timeline. And now we have a PNG. So it's a real quick way of not just manipulating the box itself, but hopping from inside and outside the box just by using these tabs. Really cool. If you want to know more creative ways to use these compound clips, as well as knowing one of that biggest drawbacks, make sure to click this video here. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. See you.
