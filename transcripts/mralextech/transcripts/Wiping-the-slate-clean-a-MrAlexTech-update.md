What up, folks? It's Alex. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Whatever you've been doing. I hope you're really, really well. Having a really good break if you're having a break. I hope you're just well anyway. To be honest, I hope you're all good. I haven't made a video. You've probably noticed for a couple of weeks now. I haven't actually posted any videos in December at all, which is, I think this is the first month off I've had in a long, long time. I didn't necessarily mean to have a bit of time off, but there you go. I have. I've just been caught up in other things and I haven't been making the content that I'd usually make. But I'm back. I'm going to start making loads of stuff. Thank you to everyone that commented on my community post the other day with ideas for things you'd like to see. I've already started building up a good list of those, so we can really get cracking with those in the new year. If there are things that you want to see, let me know down in the comment section below. I'll make sure to read all the comments I'll reply to everyone that I can, and hopefully we can put together some good content for next year. I am going to try and mix things up. I know they say this a lot, actually, but going to try and mix things up. I've just ordered some Anamorphic Lenses. I want to get more into filmmaking and having a bit of fun going out there, shooting some cool stuff. So we'll see how that goes. And just throw some other videos out there as well. I've been doing this DaVinci Resolve stuff for a long, long time, so I need to spice it up to make things fun and exciting for me, so they don't just become a little bit dull and a little bit samey. So yeah, I've got some areas that I need to improve. I need to get better at color grading. That's one of my big things this year. I know enough to do a basic tutorial, which is in the works. I know a few people ask for that, so leave that with me. But I need to also just increase my knowledge and get better at color grading. So that's something I'm really planning to do in 2023. Loads of fun stuff. Now, this is an responsive video, but motion VFX do have a sale on. They've asked me to do a community post to let you all know, but I figured I'd mention it in the video as well. 25% off everything in stores. The link down below. Go have a look if you want. If you don't know Biggie, it's there. If you want it, 25% off everything. So there you go. And I do also want to work with some other people. I want to shout some people out. I want to get some other people on the channel. If there's someone out there that you think is worth mentioning and hopefully giving them a bit of a boost in viewership, in eyes on them, make sure to let me know that as well. Now, I am kind of going to wipe the slate clean with this channel. I'm not actually going to delete any videos. I might go make some private. I don't know if I haven't looked into that yet, but I'm going to wipe the slate clean. There's a lot of old videos, which I think I could do better now. I know more about them. So I'm going to revisit those. I think I'm going to restart the Five Minute Friday series because it's a fun series. I think there's loads more that I could do with it. So I'm going to restart the Five Minute Fridays. They're going to start coming back next year as well. And yeah, we'll just see how it all goes. See what happens. I wanted to thank you all ever so much, obviously, for being here for the past few years. If you're watching this video, then you've probably been here for a while. You're invested in the Mr. Alex Tech channel rather than just catching a DaVinci Resolve tutorial here and there. So thanks ever so much for sticking around. Thanks for watching this video. Thanks for all the love, all the comments, all the feedback, everything else that comes with having a silly YouTube channel like this. I don't really have anything else to say. I just wanted to come and do an update. I just needed to come on here and make a video because I haven't made a video in ages. And when you don't make videos, you fall out of the habit of making videos. And then the first one back is incredibly difficult to do. So now I've made a video that not many people are going to watch because it's just me talking nonsense. But we have a video and it's going out. So I can get cracking with some of the regular DaVinci Resolve stuff and whatever else takes my fancy. Yeah, so that's it. I'm going to stop talking now. So thanks ever so much for watching, folks. I'll catch you next time. See you.
