What up folks, it's Alex here, quick tip video for you today. We're going to be having a look at how to create that matte look for your images in Adobe Lightroom. Now you've all seen it, the matte look is really popular today, it's when you bring up the shadows, you bring up the black so there's no proper true black in your photos, it gives you a washed out matte sort of look. It's a really nice look for the right image. Now I'm going to show you how to achieve that look in Lightroom. It's very easy, it's dead simple and it's dead quick. So let's take a look. So what you want to do, head straight into Lightroom and on the right hand side where you've got all your sections where you choose to edit things like basic, tone curve, split toning etc, head into your tone curve. Now if it looks like this, where you've got a box with your tone curve and a histogram and then you've got region, highlights, lights, darks etc underneath, you need to click on this little icon here, click to edit the point curve. If you click on that, that will get rid of those options at the bottom, this is the screen that you want to be on. Now this line here, this is your tone curve. The bottom left represents the darks and the bottom right represents the lights. Now this is an example image I'm using, this is a random little picture of my girlfriend Becky and I've done some minor edits, nothing major, just to balance it out and set the white balance etc. Now I like it but I want to give it that matte look and give it the colours a bit more of a pastel effect. So what I'm going to do is about three quarters of the way down this line, click on my mouse to add an edit point and then I can click and drag and move that point around as I wish. So once you've set that point about three quarters of the way down, go right to the bottom and grab the very bottom point. Now what you need to do is click, hold your mouse and drag that up and as you drag you'll notice the blacks of these areas here are actually lightening up a little bit because they're pulling the blacks up and that instantly gives it a matte effect. So if we go before and after, before and after and straight away you can give it a matte look. Here's another example, again we've got a dead straight tone curve so we've got a linear curve at the moment and I want to bring the darks up to give it a matte look. So I'm going to set a marker and I'm going to bring my bottom line up. Now this time I also want the whites to be a little bit brighter so I'm going to head towards the top of the tone curve and I'm just going to pull those highlights up a little bit as well to give it a bit more contrast. And there we go, before and after. And it's as easy as that, boom, done. So that's how you do it, that's how you create that matte look in Lightroom. So go, boot up Lightroom, have a play with your tone curve, bring up them shadows and create that matte look for yourself.
