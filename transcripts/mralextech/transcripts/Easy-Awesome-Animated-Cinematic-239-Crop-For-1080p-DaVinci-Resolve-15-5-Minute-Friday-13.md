What up folks, it's Alex here and welcome back to 5 minute Friday. Now in this video I'm going to show you how to do a real easy, sweet, animated transition from the standard 16 by 9 aspect ratio into that cool cinematic wide screen 2 by 3 9 and then back out again. Now this is specifically for those people that want their videos to remain in 16 by 9 we just want to add sections with the black bars for dramatic effect. So let's crack open DaVinci Resolve and we'll have a look. So here we are in DaVinci Resolve and we're on the edit tab. Now the first thing we want to do is I'm going to just show you how to add it simply without any animation to these two clips in the middle. So I'm going to highlight my first one and we're going to do this using the inspector tool. Now if you don't want the inspector tool is or how to use it really, there's a clip linked above which shows you my previous 5 minute Friday video where I showed you how to use the inspector tool. But all you want to do is click it to open this menu on the right hand side and we're going to go down to cropping. Now what we're going to do is apply a simple crop to the top and the bottom of each clip to give it that 2.39 aspect ratio and to do that all you need to do is click on the crop top number here and enter 139 and then hit enter and I'll put that black bar at the top. In the crop bottom do the exact same thing, 139 and I'll put the black bars at the bottom and that will give you the exact same aspect ratio of 2.39. Now we're going to do the same on this clip here, 139 and 139. So if I just hit play you can see it's got that cinematic aspect ratio and as it moves from clip to clip that will apply. Now if we go to this fourth clip it's not there because we haven't actually applied it yet, the same for the first clip. Now what we want is rather than it just appearing we want it to slowly animate so it comes in over about a second, looks nice and smooth and just gives it a really nice look and we're going to do that using something called keyframes. Now simply put keyframes are markers that you can add to individual clips at which point certain attributes or certain things change within the clip itself, i.e. you can change crops and you can change volume at different points and you do that using keyframes. Now why am I in my video to look like this for the first second or so? So I'm just going to hit play and I'm going to pause at the point where I want my black bar to start coming in which for me is about here and then I'm going to go over to my inspector tool and click on the diamond and it will turn red. So that means we've added a keyframe. Now we don't need to change anything just yet we're going to leave it as it is. Now I want my animation to take about a second so I'm just going to hit space to play for about a second and at this point this is where I want my black bar to be completely in place ready to go. So we're just going to add a second keyframe. Now you'll notice these arrows have appeared so I can flick between the first keyframe and the second keyframe. Now on this second keyframe this is where we want to change the crop. So at this point there's no crop at all. At this point we want that cinematic crop. So I'm going to enter 139 and 139. So again if I flick between the two now there's no crop at there but there is a crop here. So if I move my playhead now and I can play through this first clip nothing here it will reach that keyframe and then it will animate those black bars for you. Then I'll move to my next clip where the black bars are already there the same for the third clip. Now we just need to repeat the same process but reverse it for the fourth and final clip. I can select the clip and what we need to do is just enter 139 and 139. So I'm going to just enter it on the clip without adding any keyframes because we want the start of the clip to begin with the cinematic crop. Now we just need to reverse the exact same process. So we need to find the point where we want the black bars to start moving out. So I'm going to go with about here and I'm going to add my keyframe. I'm then going to play for again about a second. I'm at 28 here so we'll go for about 29. I'm going to add my second keyframe. Perfect. So I can flip between the two again the first one and then the second one. Now because it's reversing the first one is set to 139 so we need the second one to just take us back to zero. Now if I hit play we've got the cinematic black bars and then they'll slowly animate out. Now if you want the bars to appear and disappear all within a single clip it's dead easy. You just need to use four keyframes instead of two. So I'm going to hit play. I'm going to pause here. This is where I want my bars to start coming in. So I'll add a keyframe. Hit play again for about a second. I want them to be fully in by here so I'll add a keyframe and I'll just put 139 and 139. I'm going to skip forward. I want them to start going out about here so I'll add a keyframe. Then I want them to be fully out by there so add my fourth keyframe. Reset the fourth one to zero and zero. So now if I play they animate in. They remain up until the next keyframe and then they animate out again. Easy peasy. And that's it. I hope that was useful. Now don't go wrong there's lots of different ways that you can achieve the same thing in DaVinci Resolve. This is just one of the ways that I like it because it's quick and it's easy to remember dead simple to do and that's what we like on this channel. If it was useful don't forget to give me a thumbs up.
