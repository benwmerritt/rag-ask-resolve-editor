What up folks? Alex here. I had a comment recently asking how I created my recent vlog in the widescreen 21x9 aspect ratio. So, here's how. Now, this video has been exported in 21x9. So, if you're watching it on your phone, it should pretty much fill the screen. If you're watching it on a PC, a standard monitor, you'll notice the black bars at the top and the bottom. That's the look that we're going for. So, here we are, in DaVinci Resolve and we're on the Edit tab. This project is currently set to 1920x1080 or 1080p and that's a standard 16x9 aspect ratio. Now, the first thing we're going to do, come down to the bottom right-hand corner and we're going to click on the cog. We're then going to go to the Master settings on the left and it's the timeline resolution that we're looking at. Now, you can do this at any point. You don't need to do it at the very beginning. You can do this at any point during your project. If you have shot at 1080p, a quick one that you can change it to is 1920x800 and you change that simply by typing it in this box here. If you've shot at a higher resolution, for example, I've shot in 4K, I'm actually going to leave this at 1080 and I'm going to change that instead to be 2560. There's more information about resolutions down in the description below. We're then just going to hit Save. Now, straight away, you'll notice that our preview window here has become wider and we've now got these black bars on the left and right-hand side because our footage no longer fills the frame. So, what we need to do is to zoom in. Now, we're not going to do this on each of the individual clips. Instead, we're going to make life easier and do that using an adjustment clip. So, in the top left-hand corner, click on the Effects Library. Come down to the Toolbox, expand that, click on Effects and then we're going to grab an adjustment clip and drag that onto our timeline above all of our footage. I'll then just lengthen that out so it covers all of the footage on my timeline. And then you're going to give it a click so it's highlighted in red. We're going to go to the top right-hand corner and open the Inspector and then we're going to come down to Transform and we're going to adjust the zoom. Now, all I'm going to do is zoom in until everything fits within the frame like so. Now, because we've zoomed in, we've cut the top and the bottom off our footage so things may not be in the correct position so we need to adjust the position of the clips on our timeline. Now, generally speaking, you don't want to do this via the adjustment clip because each of your clips will probably need some slightly different adjustment. So, I'll use the adjustment clip purely for the zoom and then if we click on each of the individual clips on the timeline, still within the Inspector, come down to Position and it's the Y we need to adjust and I'm just going to move this so that everything is in the correct place like so. And then it's going to move over to our next clip and make the same adjustment so that everything looks about right. Once you've gone through your entire timeline, you can then shoot over to the Deliver tab and if I scroll down, you'll see the resolution is now set to Custom and it's pulled down through our Custom resolution so that it will export at 21 by 9. You can then just add to the render queue, start the render as normal and you're good to go. Now, I hope you enjoyed this video. If you did, give me a thumbs up.
