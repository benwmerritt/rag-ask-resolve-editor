This is the Gigabyte Aero 15. It's a 15 inch Nvidia RTX Studio Laptop rocking a 15.6 inch Samsung AMOLED display, decent hardware all packaged up in a nice solid aluminium chassis. Now a big thanks to Scan.co.uk and Nvidia for making this video possible by getting this laptop out to me. But this is not a sponsored video, I'm not being paid for this one so I'm free to say whatever I like. But, I can say but, this is actually the entry level KD model that currently costs around £1,900. It's available from Scan.co.uk and of course there is a link down in the description below. So first up let's sort of specs. As an Nvidia Studio Laptop you know it's going to be packing some decent hardware. There's sort of a minimum requirement you have to meet in order to be labelled as an Nvidia Studio Laptop so let's find out what's inside this one. For starters we've got a 105 watt Nvidia RTX 3060 laptop GPU and that's combined with Intel's 11th gen Core i7 11800H. There's also 16 gigabytes of DDR4 32 megahertz RAM, a 1 terabyte SSD, a massive 99 watt hour battery which is combined with a really chunky 230 watt power supply and then of course there's also Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 6 to make sure you've got nice fast wireless connections. That's 16 gigabytes of RAM however I think is a little on the low side especially for the price point. 16 gigabytes of RAM is plenty for gaming but on the video creation the video editing side of things is definitely on the lower side. Fortunately it is replaceable and upgradable. There are two slots so you can fit up to 64 gigabytes of RAM if you so wish. The SSD however is solid I'm getting read speeds of 5000 megabytes a second and write speeds of 2400 and there's actually a second empty SSD bay on the motherboard so you can drop in another SSD if you so wish giving you up to two terabytes of storage. Now the design is kind of different it leans much more into the game aesthetic rather than the professional sort of creator side of things but I quite like it it's not too shouty it just has a little bit of personality. It's a completely matte black finish which does look good but is a bit of a fingerprint magnet and is prone to scratches. On the front of the lid near the bottom we've got this faux carbon fiber effect which does look kind of cool and then there's this aero logo which lights up when the laptop is turned on. The only other little bit of flare is this nice little chrome aero logo around the back on the rear vent. Now it is an aluminium build all around so it feels nice and strong durable there's not really any flex going on so you don't need to worry too much about that. There is however unfortunately quite a bit of screen wobble so if that annoys you you just need to bear that in mind. We've got vents on the sides rear and bottom of the laptop to aid cooling so it does do a decent job of keeping the laptop cool but it can get a little bit noisy. When gaming they ran in the region of 50 to 54 decibels when the laptop was set to its gaming mode. That was pretty consistent you can force the fans to run at sort of full turbo speed just using the function key and the escape key that of course helps to keep the laptop cool but it does increase the noise running more in the region of about 60 decibels. We've got two two watts downwards facing speakers at the front that okay at best and not particularly great to be honest they don't get particularly loud and they lack any sort of real meaningful base but they will get you by in a pinch. Size wise it's pretty average for a laptop of this type it's relatively thin at just two centimeters at its thickest and it weighs in at 2.3 kilos or just over five pounds. Open it up which you can do so with one hand which is always a bonus you'll notice the really thin three millimeter bezels around the top and the sides of the screen. These also have got little rubber bumpers on them to help protect the screen and it also gives it a nice soft close. The bottom bezel however is pretty thick this laptop does have a bit of a chin. Then of course there's the 15.6 inch ultra HD 60Hz 16 by 9 Samsung AMOLED glass display. It covers 100% of the DCI P3 color gamut, its Vesa display HDR True Black 400 certified and it's both Pantone validated and X-Rite color calibrated right out of the factory and it's a really nice display right out of the box. Color accuracy is good it's bright enough for most uses even if it's not necessarily the brightest display in the world and saturation and contrast as you'd expect from an AMOLED display are also really really top notch. Personally my only real gripe with the display is that aspect ratio. At 16 by 9 it does feel a little bit squashed I'm much more of a fan of the 16 by 10 aspect ratio especially on a content creator laptop. It doesn't seem like much but just having that additional 10% vertical space really does make a world of difference. The fact that this laptop has the big chin at the bottom it does look like you could get away with squeezing in a 16 by 10 aspect ratio screen without really changing the footprint of the whole laptop all that much so that's definitely something I'd like to see on a future iteration. Directly underneath the chin we have this really awkwardly placed and honestly not very good webcam. It does have a privacy shield which is always good and honestly every laptop should come with a privacy shield if it has a webcam in my opinion but it's just a pretty low quality 720p webcam at a really weird angle honestly. So I'm at my standing desk exactly the same lighting as I shot the rest of the video on and as you can see it's a really weird angle. I'm stood exactly where I'd be to actually use the keyboard and use the laptop in a normal manner and it's cut me off I'd have to step back a bit and really stretch to try and use the keyboard. Underneath that we do have the full-size RGB backlit illuminated keyboard and there is some proper RGB gamer goodness to be had here. When you first turn it on it's got this crazy rainbow effect which literally does look really really cool but it is kind of distracting especially if you're trying to get some work done you're trying to do any sort of content creation. Fortunately it's really easy to adjust it using the control panel software that comes with the laptop or you can turn it off just using the fn the function key and the space bar at any time. Now one cool thing even with the illumination turned off if you hold the fn key it lights up all of the function keys you can actually see what you're about to hit which is quite a nice handy little feature. So what's it like to type on? What is actually quite nice there's very little flex due to that aluminium chassis so you don't get any movement while you're typing there's a decent amount of travel and the keys are relatively spaced out. If I'm being picky I think the keys are just a tiny bit mushy for my liking but overall it's not too bad. Of course they have tried to cram in a full-size keyboard now the only problem with that is it does shift everything over to the left. If you're typing on a desk or whatever it's not too much of an issue because you just adjust yourself or you just the laptop accordingly but if you're sat with it on your lap it does feel like your your hands are over to the left hand side a little bit more than I would like and then continuing down the laptop we've got a relatively small but really quite nice Windows precision trackpad with multi-touch it actually has a really nice click to it so it is quite nice to use. On that there is the integrated fingerprint reader which works really well with Windows Hello and there's lug me in consistently and quickly every single time. And on the sides of course we've got that IO and Gigabyte have done a really cracking job here there's a really good nice selection of ports. On the left hand side we've got our full-size HDMI 2.1 port, a mini display port 1.4, a USB 3.2 port, a combo headphone and mic jack and a full-size RJ45 ethernet port. You don't see ethernet ports on laptops of this size very often so that's really great to see. Flip it over on the right hand side working back to front we've got our DC power jack, a full-size UHS2 card reader. Again full-size card readers should be on any creator laptop in my opinion there's really no excuse. The fact that it's UHS2 is an absolute bonus. Then we've got a full Thunderbolt 4 port which means crazy fast SSD speeds and you can edit with your files on your SSDs again winner there. And then lastly we've got two more USB 3.2 ports. If I was being really picky maybe I'd like to see one more type C port on there. It doesn't need to be Thunderbolt but just another type C port just for any additional accessories and that sort of thing but overall it's a really fantastic selection of ports so I'm happy with that. You could leave the house without many dongles at all. You're pretty much good to go. So what about performance? Well as mentioned it is an Nvidia RTX Studio laptop and this falls under their creative maestro category which basically means that it should be good for editing 6k footage in real time and gaming for up to 1440p resolutions. So let's find out. For those interested in gaming I ran two of my standard gaming benchmarks. Pretty much everything was run at the 1440p resolution because that's pretty much the best resolution for this machine in my opinion. The difference between 1440p and 4k at this size is pretty indistinguishable and you just lose so many frames going to 4k so 1440p is absolutely this sweet spot. So first up shadow of the Tomb Raider. We ran the benchmark 1440p high settings with no ray tracing and we got well over 60 frames per second. We then ran the same 1440p high settings but this time we used the medium ray tracing preset and we still managed a solid 68 frames per second. Next up there was Forza Horizon. Same resolution 1440p using the high preset which obviously has the ray tracing set to medium and we got a solid 90 frames per second. We then did the same 1440p this time with the ultra preset which just put ray tracing on high and we managed an average of 65 frames per second. I jumped into some Destiny 2 to see how that works as well. Of course that doesn't have a benchmark but 1440p once again high preset it was really really playable. Absolutely locked 60 frames per second. But what about video editing? Well I'm going to open up my favorite DaVinci Resolve. This is the paid studio version. We're going to have a little play and see what it can do and just have a general idea of how well it performs. Now everything's being captured externally on an external capture card so that won't be affecting the performance whatsoever. Let's boot it up and have a look. So here we are on the laptop. Now I'm going to use the Gigabyte Control Center to make sure I'm in creator mode. This just controls the CPU GPU overclock to optimize performance and then we're going to jump into DaVinci Resolve. Now while that's loading the first project we're going to look at is actually stored on my Samsung T5 SSD. All the files are on there so let's see how this performs when it's plugged in via the Thunderbolt 4. And if we hit play we can play back at at full 25 frames per second. We can skip around it doesn't seem to be skipping a beat. That looks pretty happy. A few drop frames there but then it's caught up with itself and we'll come over here hit play and that's all looking pretty good. There's a few titles in here so let's just see how this plays. I doubt it's going to play back in real time first time around but let's have a look. That is dropping frames we've got another one just over here so we'll try this one. And that dropped a few frames but overall didn't do too bad. So playing Ultra HD 42110 bit footage on an Ultra HD timeline doesn't seem to be giving it too much trouble at all. Full real-time playback without any problems we've got color grading on here and the titles are working yes as a few skipped frames but overall not too bad. Now if it was me what I would do I drop this down to half resolution when I was actually working on it it just makes sense to have it as half resolution you don't need it to be the Ultra HD at the time being and that's going to pretty much knock everything into place and we will get pretty much real-time playback even when using these fusion titles. Now this project is a little over 19 minutes in length it's all that Ultra HD footage so I exported this off using the Nvidia encoder which means it's using that RTX 3060 to actually encode the footage and it delivered the video in just 8 minutes and 31 seconds which is a really solid export time for this 19 minute Ultra HD project so that's pretty good going. Now my videos say that it's good for 6k footage so let's try some of that as well and see how that performs. Now before we actually do that I've got this b-raw 6k samples folder we're going to copy that that's located on my Samsung T5 we're going to drop this on the desktop and we'll see how quickly this transfers as well and that's 40 gig total of video files and it's going to take about one minute 15 seconds because it's transferring it just shy of 500 megabytes per second so this timeline here 4096 by 2160 it's a full 4k resolution timeline all of these files are actually 6k black magic raw by their anamorphic so I've had to de-squeeze them which is going to drop them straight on the timeline just to show you we are running at the full resolution and all of this can be played back in real time we've got 24 frames we're not dropping anything at all I can click around and everything is working exactly as expected so Nvidia were right to market this as being able to play back 6k footage in real time without any real issues so that's thumbs up it's looking pretty good so far so we're going to go to our motion effects temporal noise reduction let's just try two frames for starters and we'll make this look slightly more realistic something I'd actually use lower that down and we'll hit play and we are dropping a few frames we're only getting 20 to 21ish frames per second if we just put it to five let's see what we get dropping a bit there 13 15 frames per second so when dropping to half resolution we can hit play and we are now getting our full real-time playback so we're getting 24 frames per second that's with five frames of temporal noise reduction on reduce that to two obviously we'll still get real time because that's actually slightly easier for this to load and we're good to go if you work backwards from that 4k or ultra ht you're not going to have any real issues using some temporal noise reduction if you do you can easily negate that just by dropping to half resolution on your timeline to get that full real-time playback back if it does struggle but overall pretty solid let's just try a couple of things to finish off so we're going to try this clip here of this guy here and we're going to try a magic mask so we're just going to open up the magic mask we'll grab a little pen we'll put a marker on and we're just going to draw over him so that he gets highlighted and we'll just give it a second to have a think now in a moment or two he should sort of turn red to show that he's being highlighted like so now if we hit play we can track that forward it's quite a messy background you'd have to refine this mask a little bit but this is just to see how it does it's playing that back actually quicker than I was expecting it to considering the resolution and the footages that we're using it's not quite real time but it's not too bad at all now for our last test we're just going to come into this clip once again we're going to drop the face refinement on there we'll just analyze this and see how it does and after a second to it's picked up this person's face it's mapped out the jaw the mouth the nose the eyes the eyebrows it's doing everything pretty good that's 10% and then we can use all of the face refinement tools to add any color to a face reduce any shadows do all that sort of cool stuff so this actually is a really solid choice for video editing in DaVinci Resolve if you're doing loads and loads of color grading massive long project you are probably going to hit the limit with that 16 gigabytes of RAM but if you're a YouTube creator you're doing much shorter 10 15 minute videos for example then you're not going to have too many issues whatsoever if you're a fusion expert again you're probably going to want something with more video RAM and more RAM but if you're a general user like I am it's actually a really really solid choice for anything that you want to do in DaVinci Resolve so there you go that is the GIGABYte Aero 15 and what do you think let me know down in the comments below thank you for watching take it easy and I'll see you next time
