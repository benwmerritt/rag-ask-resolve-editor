What up, folks? Alex here, and welcome to Five Minute Friday. And in this video, I'm going to show you how to make this super easy, super quick bloom-style transition effect like this. Now, we're going to do this using Fusion. You could realistically do this using ColorTab as well. But we're going to stick with Fusion because it's dead easy to do, and there's loads of possibilities to use it elsewhere in other projects as well. Now, this is actually a request someone asked me the other day. I'm going to show you how to make a bloom transition. So if you do have any requests, pop them down below. I do try and read all the comments, and I'll see what I can do. So let's open Resolve, and we'll have a look. So here we are in Resolve, we're on the Edit tab, and we're just going to create this real simple, quick, easy bloom transition effect. Now, like all of my transitions, we're going to use an adjustment clip. So first up, open up the Effects Library, head into the toolbox, go to Effects, and grab an adjustment clip and put it on your timeline. Now, if you've watched any of my videos, you'll know there is a bit of a bug with adjustment clips. So what you need to do is to make sure it's the length that you want it. About a second works well, but you'll feel free to adjust that as you need to. Then grab the adjustment clip, copy it into your media pool, delete it from your timeline, and then just add it back onto your media pool to get rid of the little bug that occurs. Once you've done, put it in the center of your two clips like so, and then we can head into Fusion. Once you're in Fusion, select Clips and make sure that you have your adjustment clip selected, and then you can just close that down. And you should see your nodes here, you just need to click on nodes if you can't, and we've got our media in and our media out. Now, this is really simple to do. What we're going to do is from this little toolbar across the middle here, you're going to grab this one, which is your brightness and contrast, and just going to drop it onto this line between your media in and your media out. Then open up the inspector in the top right hand corner, like so, and then you've got all these different settings which you can change. You can do your gain, you can do lift, you can do gamma, you can do all that sort of thing. So all we're going to do for this bloom transition is to increase the gain from one, all the way up to five, and then back again for the transition. And we'll do it using some real basic keyframes. So these are your keyframes down the right hand side here. Underneath your preview window, you've got this sort of mini timeline, these are your keyframes. Just grab your little red marker, go right to the far left, and then add a keyframe on gain, so it turns red. Drag your little red marker to the middle, so I'm shooting at 24 frames per second, so I go to 12. Add a keyframe, drag it to the far right, and then add another keyframe. And then in the middle one here, just change this all the way to five. So we've got one, five, and then one again. So we can just flick through them using these little icons here. If we just jump back to edit, we can play that, see how it looks. And even as it is, it's quite a nice simple bloom style transition. If we head back to Fusion, click on spline in the top right hand corner, and then tick these boxes so that you can see your brightness and contrast gain, and you should see this line here. This represents the keyframes, these are the three keyframes that we've added, and we can just smooth them out. So we can either click on them individually, or we can just click our mouse, hold and drag, select all of them, and then we can either click this icon here, or just hit S on your keyboard to smooth those out. Just going to drag this line in just a tiny bit. What that basically means is it smooths the transition. So rather than just jumping straight away from one to five to one, it slowly increases and then decreases again. So it's just a little bit smoother. And then if we hit play, it looks something like that. And that's purely just doing gain. So it's basically overexposing it and then coming back in. If you want to add some color, again, from this little toolbar here, select this icon here, which is a color corrector, and just add that onto this line after the brightness and contrast. Give that a click. And then if we just drag this around, you can see you can actually change the color. So if we wanted to do a almost sort of RGB style bloom effect, we just repeat the same process, but this time changing the color. So we're going to put our red mark at the very beginning. I'm going to add a keyframe on this color picker here. We're going to go right to the middle, keyframe that, right to the end of keyframe that, and we'll go back to the middle one and pick the color we want. So I'm going to go with a green, like so. Now if we hit play, it doesn't just bloom. It also has a greenish tint to it while it's doing it as well. So head back to the edit tab. You can give the adjustment clip a click, open up the inspector, give it a name, green bloom. You can then copy that into your media pool or into a power bin. So it's there ready to use in any other project in the future. You can just grab it from there, add it to your timeline. You've got a green bloom transition effect. And that's it. Easy as that.
