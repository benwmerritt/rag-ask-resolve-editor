What up folks it's Alex here, and I'm back again with another shadow video now if we didn't catch my original one I'll pop a link just up here for you to go have a look in that video We covered some of the absolute basics to actually get you started with your shadow now in this video We're going to have a look at three really useful things to know to make sure that you're getting the most out of your shadow We're going to have a look at the really useful keyboard shortcuts setting screen resolutions and Updating your graphics card drivers. So without further ado, let's have a look shall we? Number one keyboard shortcuts The first one is control windows and F to take you out of full screen mode So this here is my shadow desktop if I control windows and F It'll take it from full screen to windows mode It's also useful to note that there's other settings here So you can actually change the bandwidth on the fly without having to use the launcher just by going to settings and then bandwidth To get back into full screen. Just do the same thing control windows and F Shuck at number two is control windows and G if you press that your see up here It says mouse and there's three options mouse auto mouse locked and mouse unlocked Mouse locked means I cannot get my mouse Outside of the shadow window so she can tell try and drag it onto my own desktop and it gets stuck on the border So you can't actually control anything on your own PC You can just control everything within shadow if I control windows and G to make it unlocked I can now pass the border so I can click on things within my shadow as well as things outside of it If you boot up a game with your mouse unlocked it may cause issues if your mouse is going absolutely crazy Simply hit control windows and G to set your mouse to either auto or locked and it will return Back to normal the next one is control windows and S which will just restart your stream So if at any point something seems to fall over or you seem to lose connection or something goes a bit strange And it's not acting as it should control windows and S will restart your shadow stream and can help to fix any bugs and last but not least Control windows and Q will close your shadow now that won't shut down your shadow will just close the application number two updating your graphics card drivers Because your shadow comes within a video graphics card It's always a good idea to update the drivers to make sure everything is up to date Make sure you're within your shadow and not on your local machine Open up a web browser and we're going to G force dot com forward slash Drivers there is a link in the description below and you'll be taken to this screen now ignore the automatic driver updates and the Author detect it's this manual driver search that you want and you want to enter in exactly the following G force G force 10 series G force GTX 1080 Windows 1064 English all and then you can click on start search That will locate all the drivers available for that graphics card You want to select the most recent one in my case. It's the one from Tuesday, January the 15th 2019 We click the link And then we click download to download will begin so then we can give this a click if you see this prompt click yes Click okay, then simply follow the wizard through During the installation process your screen may flicker a little bit. This is normal I advise you not to do anything on your shadow PC while it's performing this process Just go put the cattle on may self-accompanied and leave it to do its thing and number three Setting your screen resolution Unless you're lucky the first time you go on your shadow PC the resolution will be incorrect Fortunately, it's easy to change hit the control windows and f shortcut to take you out of full screen and minimize shadow Now on the desktop of your actual PC or laptop whatever it may be right click click on display settings and have a look at what Resolution your actual PC and screen are set to in my case It's two five sixty by 1440 make a note of that and then you can close that window Open your shadow again and then repeat the process so right click on your desktop Hit display settings and then in the resolution I can see this says two five sixty by ten eighty So I know that's incorrect so I can click on the drop-down box and go to two five sixty by fourteen forty Well, it looks perfect to me. I can hit keep settings and now if I maximize it again It perfectly fits my monitor if when you click on the drop-down box within shadow your resolution isn't there That may mean you're using a slightly obscure or uncommon Resolution so you'll have to add it as a custom resolution Fortunately that too is easy to do first of all right click on your shadow desktop and click on the no video control panel No, if you don't see the control panel That's because you've not yet restarted your machine after installing the driver update to restart simply from start The power icon and then restart your machine once the shadow PC is rebooted You should see the no video control panel open the control panel and from the menu on the left select change Resolution make sure not to click on any options in here simply click on customize any previously defined custom resolutions will be listed We need to create a custom resolution in the horizontal pixels and vertical lines Enter the resolution as it was shown on your local machine If you're not sure if you're using a high refresh rate monitor that generally means you're probably not 99% of the time you're okay to leave that at 60 Once you're happy click on test the resolution will then be tested to make sure it works Which in my case it looks okay. You can then choose to either save it or cancel it I'm going to click yes to save and then you'll be back on the customize window and that new resolution will be added Then you click on okay now your resolution may not have actually changed yet You've just created the custom one you've not actually assigned it so scroll up in the list to custom Select the custom resolution and then click on apply if like me you access shadow on a multitude of different devices with different Screens and screen resolutions you can set multiple custom resolutions for each different device Right real quick tip for screen resolution If you're using your shadow on a nice swanky 4k TV and you're planning to move over to an old scummy low resolution laptop Before you shut down shadow on your TV Just knock the resolution down if you leave it at 4k You might not actually be able to access your shadow on your laptop because it won't be able to display the 4k resolution So knock it down before you turn it off. So it's ready to access when you boot up on your laptop And that's it folks.
