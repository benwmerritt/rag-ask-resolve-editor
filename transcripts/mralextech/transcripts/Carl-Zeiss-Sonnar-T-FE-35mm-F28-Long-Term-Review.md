What up folks it's Alex here and I'm back with another video and today we're going to have a look at this. This is the Sonar 35mm f2.8 prime lens by Zeiss for the Sony system. Now it's actually one of the oldest FE lenses that you can get because this was announced and released back in 2013 alongside the original Sony a7 and the original a7r. It is only a 2.8 it's five years old and the price tag is still quite hefty so is it still worth your time in 2018? Let's take a look. So we'll start off by talking about the build quality and the handling. It's an FE lens so it's designed for the Sony a series the full frame series but it does mount very well on the APS-C cameras like the a6000, a6300 and a6500. On full frame it's 35mm on the crop sensor camera it has an equivalent field of view of 52mm. The most obvious thing you'll notice about this lens is that it's small. It's not quite a pancake lens but it's not far off it's tiny and because of that size it fits equally well on the a6 and the a7 series of cameras. It's also super light at only 120 grams. So like in fact the one combined with the a7r has a total weight of only 760 grams. It's super portable you can throw this in the side pocket of your bag and it won't take much room at all and even when you do get your camera out it's not going to put a crook in your neck or bother you too much because it's so light you can happily carry this around all day. The other benefit of its diminutive stature is it's super unobtrusive. You put this lens on an a6000 or 6300 for example and it looks just like a regular digital camera. It doesn't look particularly impressive so people don't pay a huge amount of attention to you. They don't feel intimidated even if you're having this big lens in their face. They're quite happy to carry on about their business and not pay you too much attention at all which makes this really good for events, weddings, street photography, that sort of thing. The sort of photography way you don't really want to get noticed. Even though it's small and light it does have a reassuring density to it. It doesn't feel cheap and plasticky. The exterior is made of metal as is the mount and the filter thread at the front. All are metal. The internals are plastic. Now it does come with a very interesting lends hood which I don't have because I bought this used so you're not going to see that in this review. It doesn't have a rubber gasket on the rear but Sony do say that it is dust and water resistant. Apparently the seal itself is so tight that doesn't require a rubber gasket. Now I have shot with this lens in some mild rain and it's never skipped a beat so I have confidence in that. I wouldn't take out on a downpour of thunderstorm but a light bit of drizzle and you'll probably be fine. The lens itself is pretty scarce. There's no focus hole buttons or auto focus to manual focus switches. The only control you do have on the lens is the manual focus ring which is nicely weighted and pretty smooth. Now as it's a Sony lens it's a flyby wire system so it doesn't actually have any dead stops. It will just keep going to infinity. There is some branding on the lens. There's the lovely blue Zeiss logo on the left hand side depending on which way you look at it. You've got the F2.8 35mm on the top and then you've got Sony on the right hand side and that is what you get. This lens doesn't have any image stabilization built in but at 35mm that shouldn't be a deal-breaker for you. 35mm is generally relatively easy to hold steady especially on full frames. It's quite a wide field of view but if you're shooting on an A7 II or onwards or an A6500 then you can build an image stabilization anyway so that shouldn't be too much worry for you. If you're shooting on an A6000, A6300 then it may be more of an issue because neither of those have image stabilization and obviously on those cameras you'll be looking at a 52mm so you may start to get some camera shake in lower light. And that's about it. It's a very well constructed lens. It's small, it's light, it's super portable, it's unobtrusive, it's somewhat weather-sealed but it doesn't have image stabilization. That about covers the build. Image quality is very very good at least from my experience. It's sharp in the center from F2.8 onwards and the corners are relatively sharp but as you stop it down to a 4.5.6 they're sharp another little bit as does the center but it's completely usable from F2.8 whatever you're doing. I generally leave this at F2.8 whatever I'm shooting unless I need the extra depth of field. You don't need to worry about shooting wide open with this lens because it is sharp from 2.8 onwards. While it's only an F2.8 you do get a reasonable amount of bokeh with it if you get close enough to your subject and the bokeh that you do get is buttery smooth. Being a Zeiss branded lens you would expect good contrast and color and that again here is the case. The colors are very nice and you get a decent amount of contrast and you get that Zeiss pop as they call it. Flair is handled reasonably well and to be honest I've never had a shot ruined because of lens flare. Color fringing and chromatic aberration are handled well. You will get a little bit if you've got a backlit subject but it's not too bad it's never going to ruin your shot and it's easily removed in lightroom. Vignetting however is handled relatively poorly. You get quite a lot of vignetting especially wide open F2.8. As you stop down that does improve however. Right I think it's time we go out and get some actual real world phones. So here we are in lightroom and there's a couple of these shots that I took when I was out in the field. This is the first one which we're going to have a quick look at. This is the RAW file straight out of the camera with absolutely no changes or edits on it at all. As you can see I've purposely shot this wide open at F2.8. It's backlit the sun is just over here somewhere and as you can see the background is blurred right out of focus and it's lovely and silky smooth. Now if we have it right at the center where I focused the center is sharp. This was at say at F2.8 and the center is completely sharp right here. Looks really good to me. As it drifts out this slowly just drifts out of focus. You can see some color fringing. There's some green lines especially noticeable around about here. Let's go a bit further in. So you can see that that color fringing going on there but it's not too bad. Nothing down there. There's no flare even though the sun's over there so that shot was handled quite well. The colors are quite good. They're a little bit muted but they're not too bad. I just boosted them, added a bit of orange and that's the result there. Here's another example. This time shooting directly into the center without a lens hood remember. So again this was shot at F2.8 so it was wide open. If we go to the point where it's focused one to one. It's pretty sharp and looks good. There's lots of detail in there. There is some sun flare. If we see here this little mark there's a little bit of flare there but overall some more going on there. Not too bad considering I was shooting directly into the sun. There's a little bit but it's not too bad. Again, both of the out of focus background here is nice and smooth and actually on this one I don't really see any color fringing or anything else at all so that doesn't look too bad at all. If I apply my edits to that one, there you go much nicer. This one's a much broader scene but again I shot this at F2.8 so just so you can see how sharp it is. If we go right into the focus point which I think was about here, give that a second. And again, lots and lots of detail. That's all nice and sharp. We go over to the right. All this is still nice and sharp. It is noticeably soft here on the edge of the frame but it is here in the center and the same over on the right hand side but it's still not too bad. Let's go here. I took it to work with me and had just a few random snapshots. Nothing too exciting but we'll have a look again here. This is F2.8 so just to show the sharpness in the center. There you can see all the detail. It's nice and sharp right in the center of the frame. Happy with that. Sun stars. This was shot to F10 so you can get the sun stars if you shoot in the right conditions. You notice at this F10 there is very little. I can't see any color fringing or chromatic aberration or anything at all on there. There's no weird colorings going on which is pretty good. This photo here. This one was at F2.8. You can see the sun behind the trees. This one there is. It's a big lump of purple here which is some lens flag going on. And if you look closely around the edge of where the sun is there is some more of there, more around here I believe. But overall it's relatively well handled considering I'm shooting basically directly into the sun. Another bokeh shot here as you can see the sharpness and the detail in the center is very good. In the background, marks away nicely. This bokeh is nice and round. Maybe a little bit messy, tiny bit just there but overall very very smooth. Lastly we'll just have a look at this one. This was shot with the 35mm set to F8. It's an old light painting shot that I did. It was taken with the original A7 or the other ones were on the A7R2. If we have a look it's pretty sharp. This is a say at F8. Plenty of detail. Really happy with that. There's a few other frames from the same light painting session. Again it's all very sharp. It's all handled particularly well and for those interested that's the end result from that light painting session. The autofocus is fast, accurate and quiet both on the A7 and the A6 series of cameras. I've spent most of my time with this lens on the original A7 camera. Even on the oldest Sony camera it was perfectly usable 90% of the time. On my new A7R2 and my A6500 it's rapid. When you start to get silly low light or areas with very little contrast it does start to hunt a little bit. It will generally get there eventually. Sometimes it will go past the subject and back again before it actually locks focus but that is when the light is really dim. Right this is a real quick low light autofocus test to give you an idea of how dark it is in here. I'm shooting this on the A6500 with the Sigma 16mm f1.4. It's wide open at f1.4 and my ISO is at 6400 to record this video. The 35mm is attached to my A7R2. I'm shooting wide open at f2.8 and I've had to set my ISO to 12800 just to get a shutter speed of 1.15th of a second. So it's pretty dark. Face detection and eye autofocus work very well. I've put that to the test. This is the test with the 35mm on the Sony 87mm. So this is a continuous autofocus test with the original Sony 87mm. Continuous autofocus. Face detection is on and the focus type is set to wide. So we'll see how this does. Exactly the same test but this time on the A6500. So let's see how this performs. My only gripe with the autofocus system is the minimum focus distance. It's 35cm which sounds reasonable on paper but for some reason it feels like it should have been closer. It feels too long especially when you're using such a small camera and lens. It feels like you should be able to get closer. It's caught me out a few times where I've been thinking why were there's bloody focus and it's actually because I've been a centimeter or two too close to the subject. Overall I'm perfectly happy with the autofocus, the speed and accuracy and I've never really had it let me down. Price. Now price is where in my opinion this lens really falls down. It's a very good lens but the price is going to scare people away and if I'm honest rightly so. This teeny little lens currently has an RRP from Sony of £859. Fortunately you can pick it up for a little bit cheaper off the likes of Amazon for example who currently have it for £679. However that's still quite expensive for what it is. For comparison the Nikon Nikkor F1.8 Prime is £518. The Sigma Art 35mm 1.4 is £649. Canon 35mm f2 with IS £519. The Samyang 35mm f1.4 £599. You catch my drift. This is more expensive than the vast majority of 35mm on the market at the minute. There's also the Samyang 35mm f2.8 to contend with which has only recently come out and that's currently priced at £249. This thing is £600 more retail than the Samyang version. Now I don't have the Samyang version to test. I've read, I've heard it's very good, I've heard it's sharp. I heard it does have some minor focusing issues but is this worth £600 more? Now that sounds very negative. Do bear in mind that you can't pick these up used which is what I did which is why I don't have the length hood. I picked this up about a year or so ago. I think I've had about 350-400 quid for it. Overall I really like this little lens. It's small, it's light, the colours are punchy, the contrast is excellent, the centre sharpness is really good, the focus is fast and silent and accurate. There's a lot to like about this lens. Yes the aperture could and should really be faster being an f2.8 you feel that it could have put it as an f2 at least which would have made it a slightly easier sell but f2.8 is plenty fast enough most of the time. It's unassuming size and profile do make it really really good for event photography, street photography, weddings etc where you want to blend in rather than stand out. It's not an intimidating piece of kit which to me is a massive pro. So can I recommend it? Yes and no. If you need a really small, light, sharp, punchy, contrasting lens then it's probably one of your best bets. It is potentially from one of red better than the Samyang version but that comes at a massive additional cost. If you just after a 35mm size and portability aren't that important to you then there are much better options for less money that are considerably faster. So if it fits your niche honestly you'll adore it go out and grab it but if you're worried about the f2.8 then it's probably going to bug you for a long time. I'd look at something faster. Me personally I'm never going to sell it. I really like having the option to throw this tiny little thing on the camera when I just want to go out and take some snaps so to me it's a great lens to have in a kit but I even now wouldn't pay £859 for it. And that's it. There's my thought on the Sony 35mm f2.8. Let me know in the comments below if you agree.
