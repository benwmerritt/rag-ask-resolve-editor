Short answer, yes. Probably. Long answer, yes. Probably because it still is a really fantastic laptop even for editing in DaVinci Resolve. I've had my little MacBook M1 Air for a little over a year now and honestly I've really enjoyed using it. It's actually the first ever Apple device which I've purchased myself because I've never really had an interest in what they were doing but the M1 Air seemed interesting. It seems to be super efficient to be able to do things that notebooks shouldn't do which is why I went out and picked one up and I've thoroughly enjoyed it. Now I did pick up an M1 Pro as well upon release not necessarily because I was unhappy with my Air because I wasn't. It was doing 90% of what I wanted it to do but I sort of got caught up in the hype. I wanted to see what the fuss was about with the new ones so I did pick one up. Now I've used both of them for a little while and if I'm completely honest I actually think the M1 Air is the better choice for most people or at least 80 or 90% of people. It really depends on what you're doing in DaVinci Resolve but I think most people would be happy sticking with the M1 Air rather than paying considerably more money to pick up the M1 Pro. So what model is my MacBook Air? Well I actually went for the 512 gigabyte version that's with 8 gigabytes of RAM or unified memory as they called it so that means it's got the 8 core CPU and the 8 core GPU and it cost me £1,249 brand new and that's actually still what it's listed for on the Apple Store. And yes I did say 8 gig, there's just 8 gigabytes of RAM or unified memory in my laptop and it's done fine. Honestly 8 gigabytes of RAM in a Windows machine just isn't enough really for editing especially doing any sort of 4k stuff in DaVinci Resolve but I've been really impressed with how the MacBook Air handles that little amount of RAM. Now to give you an idea of what I'm comparing it to it's this one here I've actually made a video on this if you want to see a more in-depth review sort of test of the Pro model I have done a video that's linked up there but this is my MacBook M1 Pro with the Pro processor always amoutable. It's the 1 terabyte model that comes with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 10 core CPU with 16 core GPU and it cost me a grand total of £2,399 which is a lot of money or in other terms it's pretty much bang on twice the price of the M1 MacBook Air which I purchased last year but it is twice the laptop. Aspects at twice the price you get twice the RAM 8 gigabytes versus 16 gigabytes. I've got twice the storage I also check the speed of those drives and the 1 terabyte drive is twice as fast in terms of both read and write speeds. We've got twice the number of GPU cores, we've got more than twice the number of ports and I can go on the internal display is only just a little bit bigger you've got 12 versus 14 inches but the Pro one is twice as bright you've got 400 nits on the Air versus 1000 nits on the Pro. The refresh rate as you've probably guessed is also twice as high you've got 60 hertz on the Air whereas you've got up to 120 hertz on the Pro model. Even the speakers in my opinion are about twice as good. The M1 Air speakers are actually really good for the type of device for such a small thin device but the speakers on the M1 Pro are probably just about the best speakers I've heard on any sort of portable device. It even technically charges twice as fast because the M1 Air comes with just a 30 watt charger while the Pro model comes with a 96 watt charger. That's not to say that the battery is twice as big though. The Air comes with a 50 watt hour battery versus the 70 watt hour battery on the Pro. However the Pro is more powerful so it does use a little bit more power. In terms of battery consumption I found them to be very very comparable they're very similar I wouldn't give a win to either both are really really outstandingly good when it comes to battery life. So it is one of those rare occurrences where you pay twice as much but you do literally get twice as much for your money but and it's a big fat juicy butt do you really need it and that's the question that's the question you should be asking yourself because the Air is still a really surprisingly capable laptop I'm going to jump into DaVinci Resolve in a moment and show you a quick demonstration of one of my genuine projects that I do skip around to show you how it performs in there but before we do I just want to talk about one other thing one of the area that the Air actually comes out with a bit of a win over the Pro and that's fall factor. The Air with its design with its sort of chamfered edges it just feels smaller it feels more portable it's a little bit lighter on the lap it slides into bags just that little bit easier and it doesn't have any of the weird sharp edges which the Pro has seriously this bit here is weirdly sharp it has no reason to be that sharp and it's quite uncomfortable when you catch your wrist sight. Plus there's no notch on the Air now I have got used to the notch I've used the black wallpaper to hide it but every now and again I'll sort of lose my mouse under it or go looking for something in the taskbar and it shifted over to the right and honestly it just kind of upset to me I don't really like it. I actually gave my Pro to a child the other day and he saw the notch and he just burst into tears. Okay that's not actually true but I can imagine it happening plus on top of that the Air is of course fanless kind of weird that it's called the Air it doesn't actually do anything with Air but there you go the Air is fanless and this in itself is a bit of a Pro and also a bit of a con. It's a Pro because no fans means no noise it's silent all of the time you don't hear anything kicking even when it gets hot but on the flip side to that it does get hot it can get really hot after long amounts of rendering the bottom is really really warm to the touch and eventually it will start to thermal throttle which will reduce the performance however you do really need to have it sitting at 100% for quite a long time I'm meaning like 30, 40, 50 minutes before it really starts to feel hot and then probably starts to thermal throttle from there sort of 10, 15, 20 minute renders it won't thermal throttle whatsoever. So yes it might be half the laptop that the Pro is in many many ways but it does have some minor advantages over the Pro but the main thing for me and I think for you is even though it's half the laptop it's still likely to be good enough as long as it's good enough ignore the hype ignore the fear of missing out as it's called the MacBook M1 Air is probably good enough for most casual editors. Now let me prove it to you I'm going to open up DaVinci Resolve and we'll take a quick look. Now I'm going to run the first half of this on DaVinci Resolve Studio I will give you a quick demonstration of the free version as well later on in the video. I'm capturing the footage using a capture card so none of the performance will actually be hindered because I'm using any software or anything like that. So let's open it up and take a look. Now I'm going to use this project this is my Studio tour video I've linked it down in the description or you can click on the card that's on the screen now so you can actually see the project for yourself if you want to. Now this is quite a long project it's 20 minutes long in total just under it's like 19 and a bit and there's loads of stuff going on on here. Now I'm just going to open up my media pool you can see I'm on this tutorial timeline I'm just going to open the settings for that one and show you that it is Ultra HD or 4K 3840 by 2160. Now let's just close the media pool I'm going to go to my playback I'm not using opti's media or proxy timeline proxy mode is off and my render cache is non I'm going to delete my render cache just to get rid of everything so you can see it's all happening in real time. Now this project is actually a bit of a mess the timeline is a bit of a mess I messed up some of the exposure so I had to use some adjustment clips to bring the exposure down so it's actually a really good sort of real life example which we're just going to whip through and I'm going to show you the performance of this M1 Air. Now all the footage on the timeline let me just click on this random one here we'll go to the inspector file all of the footage is H.264 422 10-bit Ultra HD footage from a Panasonic Lumix S5 so that's there's no sort of black magic rule which is a little bit easier this is H.264 there's actually some H.265 footage in here as well if I can just find some this is H.265 10-bit 420 I believe also in Ultra HD and that's been slowed down to run at 25 frames per second so we actually get that in slow motion now everything's graded so let me just show you that real quick we're going to jump into the color tab this is my same sort of color correction that I always do on these videos we've just got a real simple LUT just to bring it to Rec 709 then we've got some basic color world adjustments and some sharpening so nothing fancy but this is again real life this is what I do for the majority of my projects so now we're just going to hop onto the edit tab and all we're going to do first of all is just jump about I can just trim through the timeline it doesn't skip a beat it has no problems whatsoever we can just skip through let's pick a point here we'll hit play and it's just going to play back in real time this is 4k or Ultra HD timeline with Ultra HD footage no proxies and it's happy as Larry we'll skip over here and that'll play we'll go over here and then play over here the intro has some quicker sort of jumps edits which sometimes can trip things up that's just going to play through with no issues whatsoever so you can see it's pretty comfortable at doing this sort of thing this bass level editing it really doesn't skip a beat at all now I'm just going to just zoom into this b-roll here so this b-roll I haven't actually compressed or flattened this at all so this footage is playing over the top of this one here so we're just going to go to video we're going to zoom this out so we can see both so they're actually playing on top of each other so we've got two streams of 4k and we'll hit play and that's not dropping a single frame it's playing both streams of 4k that's color corrected on this 4k timeline without any issues let's grab this one we're just going to drag this one above here for now we'll lengthen that one out it's not graded but that's no issues let's just zoom that out move this over here so now we've got three streams of 4k we'll hit play and again it's still not dropping a single frame it's playing all three back 25 frames per second two of which are colored let's just click on this one we're going to go to the dynamic zoom toggle that on hit play see what that does still absolutely fine let's go this one we'll put dynamic zoom on here as well we'll hit play that's absolutely fine let's go to effects and let's just drop a diamond transition on that one for whatever reason we'll hit play and it's absolutely fine we'll do a quick cut on this one delete that section so as you can see for that sort of thing an ultra hd 4k timeline with 4k footage it's quick as anything honestly you can just skip around you can cut you can make all your amendments and there's no problems at all even with three layers three streams of 4k without any proxies it's playing it back absolutely fine now where it starts to stumble or slow down is when you start to do some more complicated things with fusion some things which rely a little bit heavily on using the cpu and the gpu so let me just show you some of those titles and then i'll show you how you can get around it using a device like this so we're going to skip over to this title here now it's not a massively complicated title but if we hit play you can see we are dropping frames it's just looking a little bit skippy it's found itself and then it's been all right so that's still not too bad you can see it's skip frames at the beginning and then it sort of finds its flow let's find another one skips a few frames sort of figures it's half out and then it's fine so you do notice that when you're using any sort of fusion title these aren't the most complicated but we are dropping frames now the same thing can be said for transitions so a lot of these standard ones you things like your iris and the emotion now will be absolutely fine is when you start to use the fusion transitions so let me just grab circles and we'll drop this one on here and we'll hit play and you can see it's dropped frames and it's just sort of struggling to keep up now if we just do one more example let's use one of my old spin transitions we'll hit play and again it's just struggling to keep up a little bit now this is 4k on 4k which on this laptop using the in-belt monitor makes absolutely no sense because this isn't even a 4k display or an ultra hd display it's 2560 by 1600 which is more of like a 2k display with the preview window sat in the middle of the screen really you're only seeing that at maximum 1080p sort of proportionately on your device i've actually made a video where i've discussed why i never edit in 4k which you can click on up here or down in the description so what i would do in this instance is either lower my timeline resolution to 1080p just while i edit it or use the timeline proxy mode which is what we're going to do right now so i'm going to go playback timeline proxy and i'm just going to turn this to half resolution which is about 2k now the actual preview window you'll barely notice a difference because we can't see 4k anyway so it's between 4k and 2k on this monitor is negligible at best and we're just going to go back let's find a title for starters this one over here and as you can see it will now play this back in full 25 frames per second without dropping a frame we'll go over try this one and it'll do exactly the same thing now we'll go back to it and edit point and this time we'll drop the drop warp on here again and we'll hit play and as you can see i'll have no issues with that let's grab the same spin transition we'll drop it over on this one over here and we'll hit play and we'll have no issues with that either now the same thing can be said for noise reduction so i'm going to give this a click we're going to hop into the color page we're just going to make sure that we're on this specific clip here and then we're just going to go to noise reduction we'll add one frame we'll just go up to about 20 ish and we'll hit play and after the transition is finished it will play this back with and temporal noise reduction with one frame at 25 frames per second now let's just do the same thing we'll go up to three and we'll hit play and it all starts to skip a few frames we're only getting 20 here and then if we go to five we can play it back but we're only getting about 15 frames but what about rendering i'm just going to go to the deliver tab and i've actually rendered this project out already i've tried it twice just to make sure and it renders this entire project with all the fusion titles the color correction at h.265 mp4 at ultra hd and it takes just 13 minutes there's 13 minutes 30 and then 13 minutes 27 remember this is a 20-minute project so overall that's not too bad at all now i actually monitored the battery life as well and it used just 9 battery to do that render so if we do the maths you can actually have one of these airs sitting maxed out 100 rendering and i'll actually render for about two and a half hours which is quite a lot when you think that it's sitting at 100 percent or to put it another way 20 minute video 9 percent you could render out a 4k video that's almost four hours in length on just a single charge you could render martin's corsages three and a half hour epic the irishman in 4k on a macbook air on a single charge and still have a little bit of juice left over as a notebook without a fan that's kind of mad now obviously when you're editing when you're actually doing the editing itself you're very rarely sitting at that 100 percent so realistically you can double that battery life anywhere between four to six hours of actual editing has been my experience and that's pretty much what you can expect obviously it will vary on the format on the resolution on how many effects how many fusion things you're using but four to six hours is a pretty good ballpark but what about the free version well i've actually just reverted my macbook back to the free version of the vintage resolve and i'll show you exactly how that looks as well we're in the exact same project everything was the same as before but i've set the timeline proxy mode to off once again and again we can just skip through overall the performance is very very similar i can just pick a point hit play and i will get the 25 frames per second same timeline same resolution same everything basically except obviously for the noise reduction but we can skip around it's still a very very capable machine even on the free version of the vintage resolve we can skip through and it is happy let's find one of the titles or hit play and again it's going to skip frames it looks very similar to as it did before so let's go to playback timeline proxy half resolution zoom in a bit we'll hit play once again and that's going to fix all of the issues for us and that's going to give us the full 25 frames per second what about the multiple tracks well if we just find that point in the timeline once again and hit play again no issues we've got the little transition we've got the dynamic zooms on we've got the three streams of 4k and it's having no issues whatsoever it really is a perfectly capable little laptop especially if you're looking for something to edit on the go the form factor is great the battery life is really really good and the performance is way better than you'd think possible from a fanless little notebook is it good enough for you well only you will know that but if what you do is very similar to what you've seen in this video i think you'll be surprised at how good the m1 air really is if that doesn't fit your needs if you need a bit more than i've shown you then obviously you will need to pay a bit more and go for something a little bit more powerful now if you are interested in the air but you think you want maybe a bigger hard drive one terabyte or you want to go for that 16 gigabytes of ram rather than the eight gig then things do start to get a little bit more complicated because the prices start to jump up really quite quickly if you were to take the air up to one terabyte of storage and then 16 gigabytes of ram you're looking at about 1649 pounds which is getting remarkably close to the base pro model now that comes with 512 gigabytes of storage and the same 16 gigabytes of ram but of course you get a better screen you get all the additional ports you get the best speakers all that sort of stuff for just 300 pounds more i personally think the air the 512 gigabyte of storage and if you can find it the 16 gigabytes of ram is probably the sweet spot especially if you can find one used for about that 1200 pounds sort of mark then that starts to make sense but as i said at the beginning don't be put off by the eight gigabytes especially if you do less than what i've shown you in this video you will really be surprised at how much you can actually do with just eight gigabytes of ram on these devices just to make the point i'm actually going to edit this entire video on my macbook air not going to use my pc not going to use my pro i'm going to do it all on the air and it's going to be edited at a higher than ultra hd resolution i'm going to be using a cinema 4k resolution for this one i'm actually going to put the render time down in the pinned comment below so if you're interested in that go and check it out anyway i hope this video was useful if it was give me a thumbs up any thoughts or feelings down in the comment section below thank you for watching take it easy i'll catch you next time
