The key to faster editing in DaVinci Resolve. It's the Alt key or the Option key. If you're on Mac, they do the same thing. Here's a whole bunch of reasons. Why? So we all know how to add media onto our timeline. I've got this clip here. This has both video and audio. However, if I hold the Alt key, click on it within the media pool, drag it on my timeline, we just get the video. Neat trick for adding just video onto the timeline. Just a heads up if you want to do the exact same thing with the audio. Just hold the shift key instead, drag, and then you'll just add the audio from the clip onto the timeline instead. Now this clip has been added onto my timeline. And as you can see, there's both video and audio, but I want to select either just the video or the audio really quickly. You can do that using the Alt key. So I'm going to hold down the Alt key and then click on the audio track. And as you can see, just the audio track will be selected. And then I can hit the Bat Space key to get rid of it if I want to. Super quick way of selecting just the audio or the video independently on the timeline without actually unlinking them. Now let's say that I've got a separate audio track down here and I want the audio to move down a track. So I'm going to hold down the Alt key, click to just select the audio. I can then hold down the Alt key again. While I'm holding the Alt key, I can use the up and down arrow keys. So I'm going to hit down and I can just move that audio track down a track down here. So then I can put other things here. Everything's still linked. I can move it around, but we've just made room for some additional audio. I'm not going to hold Alt this time. Just going to give it a click. You can see both my video and audio are selected. And then going to hold Alt. I'm going to use the up arrow key and I can move everything up or down on the timeline like so. Now let's say I want to duplicate this clip. So again, I give it a click. Both are highlighted in red. And then going to hold down the Alt key, click my mouse, hold my mouse. So I'm holding the Alt key and my mouse drag and we'll make a duplicate of that clip. That works the same way if I just delete that one. Hold the Alt key, click on this one so that it's highlighted in red. I'm keeping hold of the Alt key. I'm going to click and drag and now I've made a nice quick duplicate of that video clip. Now that works for pretty much anything on the timeline, video, audio, titles. You can even do it for transitions. Let me show you that. So as you can see, I've got a transition here and let's say that I've messed around with all the options within the inspector. So I want to duplicate it real quick. I'm going to give it a click so it's highlighted in red. We're going to hold down the Alt key. We're going to drag over to this edit point here and then release my mouse and job done. We've made a duplicate of that transition. Quick, simple, easy, easy. All right, you might have known some of those, but did you know that you can hold down the Alt key to add keyframes? This is a really nice way of doing some basic keyframes. So I've got this clip here on my timeline. I'm going to right click and then I'm going to go to my retime curve. And then just for this example, I'm going to click on the little drop down and select zoom. Get rid of the retime frame. So we're just looking at the keyframes and the curves for zooms. Now, as you can see, we don't have any keyframes already set. So all I'm going to do hold Alt, click on the line, and now automatically add a keyframe. So I'm going to add another one before and another one after. And then I can just drag this up. And now we've got a real quick zoom in and out just by holding the Alt key to add the keyframe. Now, another cool thing, if I highlight all of these keyframes, simply by clicking in an empty space, dragging like so. So they all turn red. You've guessed it, hold the Alt key, drag, and then you can make a duplicate of that little sequence of keyframes. So if you've done a basic animation, you can really quickly duplicate it like so. But what about audio? I hear you ask, well, it works in pretty much the same way. So again, we've got this clip down here and I've got my audio. I don't know if you can see, but there's a faint line right over here. And if I hover my mouse, my cursor changes. If I give that a click and hold, I can drag up to increase my volume and drag down to decrease it on this clip. Now, if I hold Alt and click, I can add keyframes once again. So if I need to duck my audio, let's say about here, I'm going to add two keyframes, I'm going to come afterwards, drag the line down to about minus 12. And now we've got a real nice quick, easy way of just going through the timeline, ducking the audio, or even increasing it, doing what we want, just by holding Alt, clicking the line to add a keyframe. Job done. Now, still talking about audio, let's pretend we're trying to match these two tracks. Maybe we're trying to edit to the beat or whatever it may be. You can see these two points on these waveforms need to be in exactly the same position. I'm going to give this one a click, and then I'm going to use my full stop or period and the comma keys on my keyboard to move this left and right on the timeline. But I'm moving a whole frame. And as you can see, I can't line these up. While you guessed it, there's an alt shortcut for that as well. With the audio track selected, hold down the Alt key and then use the left and right arrow keys to do subframe scrubbing. And what I can do is move this audio track just the tiniest little bit left and right, less than a frame, to make sure that audio is in the perfect position. Yeah, looking good. There's more. Let's keep going. Got a section on your timeline that you want to watch over and over again, just to make sure it's perfect. We'll put your playhead in the beginning of that section and then hit play, like you usually would. And then as it's playing, hold down the Alt key and hit L on your keyboard, and you'll go back to that exact same position and play it again. So you can do that as many times as you like. Hold Alt, L, hold Alt, L, and you can just watch that section over and over again to make sure that it is absolutely perfect. Right, check this one out. So I've done loads of hard work getting a color grade looking absolutely perfect on this one. I've done a color grade, I've added some effects, I've changed a load of the video attributes and I've changed the audio, done loads of stuff to this and I want to copy that to another clip. Well, you're probably all aware of the Control C shortcut for copy. So hit that, Control C on the clip that has all the effects. Then we're going to go to this clip, which doesn't have any effects on it whatsoever. And this time, rather than Control V, which you probably used to paste, we're going to hold Alt and then hit V instead. So rather than Control V, it's Alt V, and this Paste Attributes box will appear. From here, you can simply tick all the attributes that you want to paste from that original clip to this one. So we've got simple transforms, we've got zooms, cropped, you can even do retimes. So if you've sped things up or slowed things down, plugins will include anything from the effects library, color correction will include all the color correction from the color tab, and you can even do the same with Fusion Effects as well. Underneath here, the same thing again, we've got audio attributes. So I'm going to click on all of them, click on Apply. And now this clip has got everything taken from this clip. Now, this isn't actually an Alt keyboard shortcut, but it's a very similar screen. So I'm going to show it to you. Let's say I've done all of this hard work, but actually now I've changed my mind. I don't want this fantastic looking grade. So what I'm going to do, give that footage a click on the timeline, open up the Edit tab at the very top, and there's an option here to remove attributes. Give that a click. Then you get the same screen once again. So then we can pick and choose the attributes that we want to remove. So for this example, I'm just going to untick everything. We're just going to get rid of the color correction, click Apply, and all my effects are there, but the color correction's gone. Or we could have ticked everything and got rid of it, reverted this clip back to its original state. If you're anything like me, you've probably got a favorite video transition. If you have, what I recommend that you do is set it as a standard transition. So if you right click on the transition within the Effects Library, you can set as a standard transition. So I want that standard transition here, rather than having to search for it within my Effects Library, I can just now hit Alt and then T on my keyboard to add my standard video transition like so. And then if I just hit Play, it looks a little something like this. Awesome. Joining clips, you can actually join clips back together in certain circumstances. So see this edit point here? I accidentally did that earlier. I've done loads of stuff since then, so I can't simply undo to join those back together. So instead, there is a Join Clips keyboard shortcut. All you need to do, put your playhead over the edit point like so, hold the Alt key and then hit Backslash. And that'll just join those clips back together like so. Now a quick caveat for this. If let's say I've deleted this section here, I'm going to do a ripple delete with the Delete key. I can't then join these two clips together. If I was to try, it would simply say Error, unable to join the clips because the clips aren't adjacent in the same source clip. Inns and out. Hopefully you've heard of using Inns and out before because they're super duper useful. But if not, let me show you because of the bunch of Alt shortcuts you can use with that as well. So if we hit I on my timeline, we'll mark an In point. If we go to further down and hit an O, we'll mark an Out point. So these are Inns and Out. Now if I want to remove that In, I can hold down the Alt key, hit I again to remove the In point. If I hold down Alt, hit O again, I can remove the Out point. I'm just going to set some more. If I just want to get rid of it really quickly, I can hold Alt and then hit X to get rid of all of the Inns and Out on my timeline. So that's super useful. Now I'm going to set some more Inns and Out like so. Let's say that you've marked in an Out point and you just want to watch that back really, really quickly where you can do that simply by holding Alt and then using the forward slash key on your keyboard. And that'll just play through any marked Inns and Out on your timeline like so. Now another quick tip for Inns and Out. I've got some Inns and Out on my timeline marked here. I'm going to jump over to the Deliver tab and it actually keeps my In and Out points here. If I was to then add this to the render queue, it would simply render out this section here within my Inns and Out. So it's an easy way of just rendering parts of a project rather than rendering the entire thing. Now those keyboard shortcuts I've just shown you work within here as well. So I can hit Alt and X to get rid of those. So it's rendering my entire timeline. Or what I can also do, let me just mark in In and Out. There's a drop down here and you can choose between the In and Out range or the entire timeline. You see why I like the Alt key? Right, just a few more. Alt and Y. Let's pretend you've got a massive timeline like so and then you've just remembered you want to add a break here. Let's say you need to add a space or gap because you want to put a title or whatever. If you hit the Y key on your keyboard, you can select everything on the timeline past your playhead on the primary track. The primary track is this little marked red one over here. Just a heads up, you can actually change the primary track by holding Alt and then using the number key. So Alt and 1, Alt and 2, 3, we'll go back to 1. I've actually done a separate video on using primary tracks. So check that it's up here somewhere. Give that one a click. It's a really useful video. But as you can see, just hitting Y has only selected this current track. I want to select everything. So you've guessed it, we're going to hold down the Alt key and then hit Y and that's going to select everything on every track past the playhead. So then I can just click, drag, move it along knowing that I've not missed anything. And I can add my title in here as I need to hold down the Alt key and then the Shift key and then use your number pads and you can actually just lock tracks. This won't delete them, this won't disable them, you'll still be able to see them. But let's say that my video track 1 here is perfect. I want to add some b-roll but I want to make sure that this track isn't affected ever by anything. I'm going to hold Shift, Alt, 1. So lock that and it doesn't matter what I do, I can't delete any of these videos from track number 1. Now one more just to finish it off, hold down the Alt key, hit like and subscribe. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next time.
