music music Hello and welcome to this my very first ever video tutorial. So what I'm going to talk about today is this lighting setup that I use for product shots. I use it for lenses if I'm putting them in ebay and that sort of thing. It's a low key sort of style so nice black background, black base or that sort of thing. I'm using a cheap product box which I bought off Amazon for about 20 quid. That's my backdrop that's the background it's like a black seamless that's gonna work quite well hopefully. On the right hand side I've got my 120 centimeter octagonal softbox with a speedlight in there. It's a really big light source which is exactly what we want so it should create some nice soft light with no harsh shadows and that sort of thing. The base is a black porcelain floor top which we just got one we were doing in our kitchen. Works really well it's a bit heavy so it's difficult to look around but for this sort of thing it works quite well. It's got just the right amount of reflection as you can see on the lens it reflects on the bottom and on the left hand side we've got a diffuser. It's actually the sidewall of the little product box but it works really well as both the diffuser and actually as a reflector so you can use it to reflect the the main light source. So we'll give that a go shortly. In terms of camera settings I'm shooting manual with the Sony a7. I'm shooting the ISO 100 just because I want the cleanest files I can and obviously I'm using flash so I don't need to worry about low light and all that sort of thing. I go for f8. I know this lens is sharper at f8 and I get a nice wide depth of field so everything called being focus and I'm going for one two hundredths of a second which is my max sync speed with this camera so that should kill all the ambient light which would be perfect it'll just be the flash light in the subject. So I'm going to have the flash I've got it on 24mm if you've got a flash that zooms I always put it to the widest setting because then it'll fill the softbox. It's quite a big softbox this 120cm so I want it nice and wide and I've come for the lowest power which is one 128th power. I generally start at that I'll start at the lowest power and then I can work my way up the power as I go. If it's too dark which you probably will we'll just increase the power. So here we go we're going to take our first shot so let's give this a whirl. There we go we have a quick look yeah as expected it's really under exposed so we're going to have to knock that flash up. So I'm going to double the flash from 128 to 164th so double the power. We'll take another shot let's have a look at this one. Still a little bit under exposed probably one or two stops so this time round we're going to knock it from 164th, double up to 132nd and again to 16th. So two extra stops of light hopefully we should have a nicely exposed shot which we do. That looks about right. The right side of the lens looks nicely exposed and obviously the left side is a little bit dark but we'll sort that out in the moment. That's how I always do my main light source. Start at the lowest take a shot. No under exposed double double up take another one under exposed and just keep going it's the easiest way and you just you'll see the difference every shot and then when you think you're about right stop leave it there and then you can crack on. So that's the main light source sort of it the right side of the lens now we need to move at the left side because that's a little bit unexposed. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to move this reflector and you can use anything you use a bog stand reflector or even just a white bit of card and I'm going to move it in as close as I can without it being in the shot. And straight away you can see that left side is a little bit brighter. So what I'm bright enough a little bit better. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get my second flash. I'm going to set this up on the left hand side. I'm going to set it to its lowest bar against a 1 128th. What I'm going to do is I'm going to bounce it off this wall. It's just going to light that the white reflector and hopefully provide a little bit of extra light. And it's a little bit brighter. It's the left side is still under exposed. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to knock that flash from 128 to 164. And we'll try again. Then you can see it's starting to build up starting to balance out a little bit. It's still under exposed. So again we're going to go for 164 to 132. So double up. We'll have a look at this one. And that's starting to look much more like it. Maybe it's under exposed. So we'll go one more. And we'll go from 32 to 16. And here we go. That looks spot on. It's nicely balanced. We've got equal light on the right and then the left hand side. Nothing's over exposed and nothing's really under exposed. We get the dark bit in the middle which I like and we've got some reflections in the base. So pretty happy with that. Not half bad. So that's it. As I say, nothing too complicated. I can get this set up, take a handful of shots and get it all disassembled probably in about an hour. So it's nice and quick. I think it looks quite good. So yeah, be sure to give it a go if you've got any questions. Just let me know and I'll answer what I can. Thanks for watching.
