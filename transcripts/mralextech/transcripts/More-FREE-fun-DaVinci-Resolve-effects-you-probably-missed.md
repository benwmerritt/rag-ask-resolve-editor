So, since you all enjoyed my previous DaVinci Resolve effects, you probably missed video of me starting to do a part 2. So here's even more effects that you probably missed in DaVinci Resolve. In this one, we're just going to have some fun playing with some effects which are hidden away on the edit tab that you can do some fun stuff with. Now, if you did miss my original video, I've linked it up above somewhere and it's also down in the description, so go check that one out. Now also, very much like that video, this video is sponsored by our friends over at NVIDIA and box.co.uk. NVIDIA Studio is an initiative to use the RTX GPU to accelerate creative applications like DaVinci Resolve and design laptops and desktop systems that expect to a creative professional's needs. And DaVinci Resolve uses that RTX GPU to deliver enhanced timeline performance, incredible GPU and AI based effects and improved rendering times. And box.co.uk have over 1 million customers, an excellent rating on trust pilots and 26 years of experience, selling laptops, TVs, gaming PCs, components and now NVIDIA Studio validated laptops. So head over to box.co.uk to browse our range of NVIDIA Studio validated laptops, plus you get free delivery on select products and the ability to select your own delivery window. Cool. With that out of the way, let's look at our very first effect. We've got this video in text effect. You see this all the time. It's really common in music videos. It's actually really easy to do in DaVinci Resolve. So let's show you how. So we've got our footage here and this is the footage we want to be playing within our text. So the first thing we need to do, go to titles within the effects library and grab literally any title you want. It can be a standard text or it can be one of these fusion titles. Just to give us something more exciting to look at, I'm going to grab this jitter one or pop this on here like so. We'll give the jitter a click in the title. We'll make it say whatever we want. I'll leave this as sample, make it a bit bigger, change the font if we want to do all the stuff that we would usually do to get it looking however we want it. So I'm going to go with something like that. Now to actually make the video playing through, we have to do something slightly strange. We have to swap these over. So I'm going to put my video on top of my text and you'll see why in a second. Now we're going to give the video a click on the timeline. In the inspector video tab, come on down to composite. You've got composite mode. Just change this to be the foreground. This is the thing that we want to see. Then select the text underneath, go to the inspector video settings, same place, composite, composite mode. Scroll down and we want to change this to be the alpha. What this basically means is this text is acting as a mask for the foreground. So the foreground is the thing that we see. The alpha is where we see it. And now really simply we've got sample with a footage playing like so. If you want to change this black background, this is actually just nothing, which is why it's black. But if we were to go to generators, let's just grab this four color gradient, put this underneath. We now have our gradient underneath like so. We can make this any color we want or alternatively we could even just put some other footage or an image underneath it. And we've got our video playing within our text with whatever we want underneath. It's surprisingly quick, simple, easy and looks pretty cool. Now of course that's a really great way of doing that trick with text, but it doesn't just work with text. It also works with basically any images as well. So I use this with PNG files to make real quick, simple masks. So I've got this star here. This is just a PNG. I've linked it down below, downloaded it for free. There's a website I use again. That's in the description. You can go and download PNGs for yourself. Now we're going to do the same thing. Put the video on top, give the video a click, come down to our composite mode and we want that to be the foreground. And then with our shape, whatever it may be, give that a click. Same thing, inspector video, come down to composite. We're going to change this to be the alpha. And now our video is playing within our star. So you can use this to make custom shaped masks really quickly and really, really easily indeed. Next up, this neon effect. We're going to use a couple of really, really simple effects to create a simple flashy neon style title screen thing. So this is the background I'm going to use. It's just an image, but you can use whatever you like. It's not really important for what we're doing. I'm going to go to my titles and I'm going to grab a text plus. The difference between text and text plus really simply is that text plus is the fusion based version. It means it does certain things. The main important bit is we can apply effects. So all the effects we'd usually apply to videos and images. If you use a text plus, you can apply the same effects to them. So we're going to give this text plus a click in the title. I've got all of my options within here. So I'm just going to put neon and I've actually downloaded a neon font. Again, I've linked this down below. You can get neon fonts from all the different sort of free font websites. And let's make this a bit bigger and make it a nice neon-y color. So I'm going to go with, I don't know, sort of a bright pinky, purple-y sort of thing like so. Now that doesn't look particularly great. So we need to just jazz it up a bit. Now I want to drop shadow on this. So for text plus, all you need to do, you go to the little shading tab, click on number three and then enable. And now we've got a drop shadow. All of the drop shadow controls are in here if you need them. So next up, what do we need to do? We need to make it flicker and then we need to add a bit of glow. Because this is a text plus, we can add those things on. So we're going to open the open effects right near the top. I think you've seen the second one down in color. There's a flicker addition. And this does exactly what you would expect. Just drop it on there, hit play. It's given it a little bit of a flicker. It's kind of hard to see at the moment, so we're going to give it a click in the effects area within the inspector. Let's just increase the range. And now we can see it's flickering. We can change the speed, the smoothness, the randomness. We can do all sorts of fun stuff to make this flicker a little bit more. I'm so happy with that for the time being. Next up, we need to add some glow. I actually covered glow in the previous video. We want the glow to sort of be universal, so it's not just on the text itself. It's affecting everything underneath. So to do that, we're going to use an adjustment clip. Grab your adjustment clip from the effects area, pop it on top, lengthen it out. In open effects, grab glow, which is down within the resolve effects light area. Pop that on the adjustment clip. And now as we hit play, it's sort of flickering. Still a bit dull. In the inspector effects glow, let's just mess with this shine, threshold, maybe increase the spread, change the gain. Now if we hit play, it's flickering. And we've got this pinky glow is also affecting the image underneath, which makes our neon look even more realistic. If you want to get super-duper fancy from within the open effects, grab camera shake, pop that on your adjustment clip. You'll need to just tone this down a bit. So I'm going to just change the speed right the way down. But now we've got our neon, our image, everything's moving at the same speed. We've got our glow and our flicker, and it just adds to this neon style title effect. Next up, this outer glow effect. It's actually just using a drop shadow, but there's a few things that you can do to that drop shadow to give this outer glow effect, which can be quite useful for just highlighting things on screen. So we've got this star here, and we just want to give it an outer glow sort of effect. So once again, open effects. This time we want to find drop shadow. That exists within the same stylized area. Third one down, drop shadow. We're going to drop it on this PNG. You can drop it on logos, whatever you want. I'm just going to pop it on here. Now you can see we've got a darkened edge. Inspector effects once again. We've got all of our controls within here. We can adjust the strength and the angle and all that sort of stuff. All you want to do, increase the strength all the way up, increase the distance all the way down, and then increase the blur all the way up. And now we've got a black outer glow. If we go to the color, change this. Let's go with, let's just go with the red so it's nice and obvious. Click on OK. And now we've got our simple red outer glow effect. Really I probably want that to be yellow because it's a star. And there we go. Just a nice simple way of making things pop on screen without having to go messing around in Fusion or the Color Page. Next up we've got this CCTV style effect. Again, it's another one that's easy to use because there's an effect which basically does half the work for you. Then you just need to change some things and you're there ready to go. So let's have a look. So for this one, once again within the stylized area, there's a simple effect called scan lines. So we're going to drop that on this clip and we're going to get scan lines. If we go to the effects area, we've got all of the controls, I'm just going to increase the frequency to give us a sort of TV style look. You can make these as fine as you like and also mess with any of the settings that you want to. I'm pretty happy with that. I want to make it black and white. So we're going to make sure it's selected. Hop into the Color Page. I'm not going to mess around too much in here. In these color wheels down in the bottom left, there's one called saturation, which is going to knock that all the way down to make it black and white. And then up here, there's one called contrast. We're going to give it an unhealthy amount of contrast to make it look more like CCTV. And if we jump back into the Edit Page, we've got this almost CC style effect. Now to put some icing on this cake, click on Workspace at the top and then come down to this one called Data Burn In. You've probably never seen this before because it's in a weird spot. And this window will appear. Make sure you select the clip option because we don't want to apply everything to the entire project. It's just the clip. And now what we can actually do is just burn data in. So if I click on the key code, you'll see the key code will appear on the preview. This design so that you can include certain things into your footage, like the real name, the shot, all this sort of metadata if you need it. So I'm going to put the source time code on there because that looks kind of cool, kind of like CCTV with that playing at the bottom. And then we can also add custom text. So I'm going to click Custom Text 1. It's just going to say Camera 1 because I've already typed that in there in the past. We're going to change the position, put it up in the top left hand corner, something like that. We'll close this down. And now we've got this simple, but effective, black and white scan lines, CCTV style effect. And there you go. Even more effects you probably missed. Now once again, big thanks to this video's sponsor, NVIDIA and Box.co.uk. If you are looking for a laptop, don't forget to check out Box's range of NVIDIA Studio validated laptops by clicking on the link down in the description below. Thanks for watching. Take it easy. I'll see you next time. Or there's a look and think of even more effects to show you. See ya.
