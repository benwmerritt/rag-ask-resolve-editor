Multiple languages and the ability to automatically remove silences. And that's thanks to the DaVinci Resolve 18.5 beta number 3 which has just been released and is available to download right now. If you're already on the beta, next time you open Resolve it should pop up asking if you want to upgrade or you can click on DaVinci Resolve top left and then check for updates. If you've not yet jumped on board with the beta but you want to hop on to this version number 3 you can do so by simply downloading it directly from the DaVinci Resolve support website which I've linked down below. Now just remember there are two versions of the beta, there's the free version and the studio version so make sure you download the correct one. Now in this video we are going to be talking specifically about the studio version, the paid for version because these updates are of course relating to transcriptions and subtitles which are only available within the studio version. So let's talk about it and we're going to start off with the big one something that people have been pestering me about and rightly so since the release of the beta multiple languages. Previously you could only run transcriptions and subtitles for English but now I'm happy to announce that Blackmagic have added 14 languages in total. So we have Chinese, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish and there's an auto category which will listen to it figure out which language you're using and then give you the correct subtitles. So this chap here is Marco Schreiber, he's a German speaking DaVinci Resolve YouTuber so if you speak German and you want to see some DaVinci Resolve goodness in German definitely go and check him out. I've stolen one of his videos from YouTube so we can test this out. I've got his video on the timeline so to create the subtitles we simply click on timeline and come down to create subtitles from audio the same way we did previously but now there is a language drop down it defaults to auto that if we give that a click we can see all of our languages within here. So I'm going to leave this on auto I'll let it figure the rest out. While we're here they have added a couple of additional features we now have lines drop down so we can configure whether we want single line subtitles or double line subtitles and they've also added the ability to add gaps between subtitles so we can have zero gaps between them or anything up to 10 frames. I'm going to leave that as zero and then simply hit create and if we have a look tada we now have German subtitles for our video now I can't read German so I don't know how accurate they are but I'm hoping they're pretty good now I have tested this to see if it will actually translate languages for you so if I run through a German video and ask for English will it give me English subtitles it will generate and initially I thought this is doing okay but then we got to about here and I don't think he's talking about big foot and then it sort of gets worse from there so yeah I don't think it's designed to do translations just yet but the fact that we now have 14 languages is awesome of course not everyone is English speaking so they've covered a bunch of languages within there some of you may still not be happy but I think they've covered an awful lot of bases with those languages so winner now you can also do the same thing with the transcriptions so you now have the ability to select the languages it does sit in a different place so let me show you that so for transcriptions you need to open up your project settings the little cog in the bottom right hand corner and then from the menu on the left subtitles and transcription transcription setup language you have the same 14 languages you can leave it as auto or you can simply select the language which you use so that's the 14 new languages covered big thumbs up absolutely awesome cool cool cool now that's about the updates for the subtitles there isn't much more to add they haven't added any additional jazzy way to edit them before anyone asks in the comments below so what's next well the big one is this ability to remove silences when using the transcription feature now weirdly black magic haven't included this as a headline feature it's buried in the notes and I stumbled across it by accident so it's definitely auto so it's definitely oh that's really good oh they've also added the ability to edit the transcriptions and manually delete some stuff yourself so basically these transcriptions now can be used to fully edit the video without having to pop things on the timeline you just delete bits from the script dump it all on the timeline and then you're good to go so let me show you how that works as well so I'm going to find my main clip within my media poll and we're going to right click and then go to audio transcription they've also added this which is really handy you now have the ability to clear the transcription from this menu which you couldn't do previously and here we go we have our transcription now for some reason at the start of this video I started singing so let's just have a listen to that be like a jam into don't really remember why I sang that but there you go so the first thing you'll notice if you've used these transcriptions before is the formatting it's much neater it's not just a big load of text we've got actual paragraphs and then we have these little markers in between so we've got some brackets with three little dots these indicate gaps now you can manually delete them if you want to so we can highlight this little section here right click and now we get this menu pop up we have an edit so if there's a typo and you just want to amend it for when you export the script you can do there is an option to delete there's an undelete and then there is a copy so obviously we don't want all this top section I can just highlight all of this I can right click and delete or simply hit delete on my keyboard and it'll put a line through that means this section won't be included when we add this to our timeline so how do you delete the gaps in one big go really simple you go to the top right hand corner there's three little dots and then you simply remove silent portions and it will automatically strike through all of these gaps as you can see here then all I need to do I'm going to hit a control a to select everything and then simply use this icon to append to drop it all on my timeline and then if we just close the transcription you can see this video has been cut up so all of the big silences all of the big gaps have been removed and then the deleted sections have been deleted so at the beginning it started off with me singing obviously bit too filled and now it doesn't now from totally honest it's not 100% perfect it leaves a bit too much silence for my liking I'd love to see a bit more control so we could actually adjust that but for a first iteration again awesome really happy not going to complain this is a brilliant feature but let me show you what I mean when I say it leaves a bit too much of a gap or not enough of a gap too much of a gap it leaves too much no no what I mean is this so in the second clip it leaves about a second or two of sort of silence of gap before I start speaking again when you listen to it it's just a bit too much it sounds pretty natural but for a youtube style video I'd cut that out generally so I'd like to just tweak that but I am nitpicking I'll be honest it's a really great feature it's awesome that they've included it and this is just going to keep getting better and better as I've mentioned before the subtitles the transcriptions for me have been really really accurate so as long as they keep getting better winner what else would you like to see if you still think there's stuff missing let me know down in the comments below thanks for watching take it easy folks see you later
