What up folks, it's Alex here and welcome to 10 minute Friday. Bit of longer video this week because we're going to be taking a look at the Alex Audio Butler Audio Plugin that's available now for DaVinci Resolve. I've been using this plugin for a couple of weeks. I really like it. It's really quick, easy and intuitive to use and it's really good at doing exactly what it's designed to do. What is it designed to do? Well, it's just there to make your life easier and save you time. It does three things. The first thing is auto volume leveling. So with a few clicks of a button, you can make sure that all of your main audio has a consistent volume throughout. You don't need to mess around doing any manual leveling or changing your volume of things. Few clicks and it'll just automatically set that volume to be consistent. The second thing is automatic audio ducking. So hopefully you can hear that background music that's playing in the background now, but it's nice and quiet so it's not interrupting me talking. If I was to stop talking, take a bit of a pause. You can hear the music gets a little bit louder, but then as soon as I start talking again, the volume automatically decreases so that you can hear my voice clearly. And then the third function is to set the compression and the volume of your master setting consistently for every single project. That means that all of your projects that you generate out of DaVinci Resolve will have the same volume, the same level of compression, so they should all be consistent to one another, which is really, really handy if you're uploading videos to YouTube, for example. Now the guys did send me a license for free to evaluate, but all of these opinions are my own. I'm under no stipulation to say anything positive at all. I just wanted to make this video to give you a live demonstration so I can show you how it works and then you can make your mind up to see whether it would be worth it or not for you. Right, with all that out of the way, let's open DaVinci Resolve and take a look, shall we? So here we are in DaVinci Resolve and we're on the edit tab. Now I've already installed Alex Audio Butler. I'm not going to show you the installation. It's dead easy. You just run a standard installer, then open DaVinci Resolve and it's there ready to go, so I don't need to talk you through that. Now what I have done is set up a really simple timeline. I've got my video track one here and then I've set up three audio tracks. I've got one for voice, one for sound effects, and then one for music. Now that's the best way to work when you're using the Alex Audio Butler and that will all make sense as to why in a moment. Now to actually apply the effects, you can either do that from within the edit tab or the fairlight tab. I like to stick within the edit tab as much as I can, just makes life easier, so we're going to stick to that for now. I'm going to open up the effects library. I'm going to expand the toolbox. I'm going to go to audio effects, VST effects, and within there we can see the four Alex Audio Butler plugins. We've got master, music, sound effects, and voice. Now they obviously all tally to the different tracks that we've got. We're going to start off with Alex Voice Audio Butler. Before we do, I'm just going to hit play on a section here and you can hear the audio as it is by default. I've made no changes at all and I've included one bit where I vary the sound of my voice a little bit. Let's just hit play about here. With all that out of the way, let's open up the wrench resolve and I'll give you a quick demonstration and show you how it works. If I talk a little bit quieter now and then go a little bit louder, hopefully the Alex Audio Butler is actually leveling this out so it sounds pretty much the same volume. That says it is straight off the bat without any plugins. We're just going to grab the Alex Audio Butler now and we're going to drag that onto my voice track and then this pop-up is going to appear. We've got a couple of options for the voice track. We've got auto volume and then we've got compression. If I hover the mouse over any of these buttons, it gives me a brief description. We can choose here between constant source and varying sources. Constant source is if you've been using the same microphone throughout, so maybe it's just a podcast or talking to camera, that sort of thing. Varying sources is if you've been moving around using different microphones, think of a vlog, you've moved from your office to outside, that sort of thing. I'm going to leave this as varying sources. Then we've got compression. We've got natural, which is a very light compression. General, which is a subtle compression, increases illegibility and consistency for all sources. A small loudness boost without sounding artificial. Then we've got max. It will be very loud but can sound harsh. I'm going to leave that as general. Once we're done, we can just close the box. If we hit play at the exact same space, open up the Vintage Resolve and I'll give you a quick demonstration and show you how it works. If I talk a little bit quieter now and then go a little bit louder, hopefully the Alex Audio Butler is actually levelling this out. It sounds pretty much the same for you. Let's give you another demonstration of that last bit. We'll turn that Alex Audio Butler off again and we'll listen to this section. If I talk a little bit quieter now and then go a little bit louder, hopefully the Alex Audio Butler is actually levelling this out. If I talk a little bit quieter now and then go a little bit louder, hopefully the Alex Audio Butler is actually levelling this out. It sounds ... As you can see, it's doing a really nice job of just levelling all the audio, bringing it to the same level so then you don't need to mess around with your levels throughout your video. That's it. Done. Drop the voice track on and then you're ready to go. Next up, we've got music. I'm just going to grab a music track and I'm going to put that onto my music track down here and then again, without applying anything, we're just going to hit play pretty much the same for you. I'll have to wait and see I suppose. As you can hear, the music is far too loud. It's completely drowning out all of my voice track. What we'd usually have to do is lower the volume of the music and then if we once did, we can mess with ducking so that it gets quieter when I'm talking and ramps back up when there's an empty space. That sort of thing. With the Butler plug-in, all we need to do is grab Alex Music. We're going to drag that onto the music track and then we get a very similar pop-up here. We've got the target volume so we can have it background music, soft, normal, loud, loudest. We're going to keep it as loud and then we've got auto-ducking, subtle, medium and contrasting. Just for this demonstration, I'm going to go to contrasting so you can see the effect in full. We've got contrasting and then we can close that box. If we just come back a little bit and we'll hit play, the audio butler is actually leveling this out so it sounds pretty much the same for you. We're playing the music now but it's so quiet because I'm talking you can barely hear it's just background noise because the Alex Audio butler is ducking it out of the way. Let's keep playing. We'll have to wait and see, I suppose. Also, if I stop talking for a second, you should hear the music start to kick in. Out when I start talking. As you can hear, exactly as I'm saying, the music is really quiet when I'm talking and as soon as there's an empty space, it ramps up to the level I've set and then quietens down again when I start talking. Dead quick, dead simple, that was all real time. You're good to go. You can have your background music. If you want to adjust the volume, we can just click on the audio track. Up the inspector, you can see Alex Music Audio butler is here. We can click on this little icon to get our pop-up back up and then we can change the ducking levels if we want to and the music level. Let's say that music's not actually loud enough and I'm not talking. I'm going to change it to loudest and we'll close that box and then if we just hit play again, we'll go about here when there's no talking. You should hear the music start to kick in. Job done. You can do the exact same thing for sound effects. If I grab sound effects and we'll put that on there, it works in exactly the same way. You've got target volume and then you've got ducking if you want your sound effects to come down when you start talking. The last one is the master. You can't actually do master volume from in here. You have to jump into Fairlight. Let's just hop into Fairlight. Try the plugins in here. It's dead easy. Again, we're just going to come over to the mixer on the right-hand side. We've got M, which is our master. We're going to click on this little plus. We're going to come down to uncategorized and then we're going to select Alex Master Audio Butler. What we're doing here is we're choosing the loudness of the project overall. Everything has been leveled to be the same volume. With the master, you can choose what that overall volume is. First up, we've got the compression. We've got general, light compression. It creates a cohesive mix. We've got boost, which will bring the loud and soft parts closer together, increasing total loudness. Then we've got the max, which is full compression for maximum loudness. I'm going to leave that as general. Then you've got the export target. You've got online, perfect volume for all web platforms, YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, etc. You've got broadcasts and then you've also got archive. I'm going to leave that as online and we can close that. That's it. Now I'll just hop back into the edit tab. The only last thing I like to do is to grab a little bit of noise reduction. I put that onto my voice channel and I'll just set that accordingly. I just use reset noise profile and auto speech mode and that will do me for now because when the auto leveling works, it can raise the volume. You do get a little bit of hiss or crackle. You can just apply that noise reduction to get rid of that and then you should have some really nice sounding audio that's all automatically leveled. It's ready. It's good to go. That's it. I hope you enjoyed this video. I hope it was useful to you. I really enjoyed using this plugin. It's really handy. I don't have the best ear for audio. I don't always set my volumes to be consistent. This is a great addition. Just makes life way easier and you don't need to spend loads of time messing with levels and volume and all that sort of stuff. I'm going to continue using it and I can recommend it if you struggle with audio as well. As I say, it doesn't do anything you couldn't do yourself, but it will save you a whole bunch of time.
