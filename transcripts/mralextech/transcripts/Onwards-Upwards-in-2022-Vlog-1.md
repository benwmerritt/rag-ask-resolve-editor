Hello, hey, you always trying to be the center of a fence, don't you? Oh yeah, you cannot be. Come on. How's it going all? Merry Christmas, happy new year, happy holidays. Thank you for getting the shot, Rose. Hey, what you doing? It's not all about you. It's not all about you. Gimpo, yeah. Oh, you're all wet. Come on, out the way. Just chill for two minutes. So how's it going? I hope you've all had a really good break, good time off with your celebrating Christmas or not. A few days off, just chilling out, doing whatever you want to do. So I hope you've all enjoyed it. As you can probably tell, I've had a cold. I've been full of cold. I wanted to make more videos over the Christmas break, but I just haven't been able to because I sound kind of disgusting, honestly. This is at the end of it. This is me sounding far better than I have been. So I sounded far too rough to be doing any of these tutorials where the main thing you're focusing on is my voice. So yeah, didn't do any of those. But there's no COVID, unlike full COVID tests, all COVID free. It's purely a cold, just the standard British common cold that comes around at this time of year. So there you go. But we're back. I don't sound too gross, hopefully. We're going to try and do some stuff. And we've got a big year ahead of us. Hopefully it's better. I'm not going to say that, actually. I'm not going to jinx anything. We have a year ahead of us. This is a new year and it will happen good or bad. Let's go with that. Much like everyone else, I guess. I have lots of plans this year, lots of little things that I want to do just a little bit differently. The channel has been doing all right, but last year wasn't the best year. It was still good. I just want things to keep improving, keep moving forward, all that sort of cliche rubbish. So lots of plans for the channel to try and do some different things. Some of my older tutorials, my old five minute Fridays, some of them are a little bit dated. Some of them, the information is still solid, but I may do things a little bit differently. Some just needed updating because DaVinci was always changed. And then some of them, my presentation was just a bit crap. I was a bit fresh. I was a bit new to this sort of thing. So I didn't do the best job I could have done. So one of my plans for this year, I'm going to go back through all the ones which I think need updating. I'm going to update those. So you may see some things which seem like repeats, but I think it's worth just going through, maybe doing a new multi-cam one. I haven't touched a multi-cam in ages, a few just stuff like that. We're going to do that. Another thing I want to do is more of this, more just chatting, getting to know people, a bit of vlogging, all that sort of fun stuff. Now I'm using this. This is the Hollyland little mic. These clip on, little clip on mics. Sometimes I want to use it on top of the camera. And I've just had an idea. It's velcro tape. So you've just got two sides of sticky back tape. This one is the fluffy side. This is the hook side hook and grab. I think it's called. So let's see if this works. So now when I can't be bothered to clip it on, it's a shotgun mic. My mic's up there. Hello. Should we go out for a walk in a minute? Should we go to the woods? One of those weird, dog ownership things you have to get used to. Never leaving the house without poo bags. And you find them in like every pair of trousers that you've got. But I know your pocket poo bag everywhere. Yeah, got it in black. Not as obvious. I mean, it's still not a professional looking solution, but not professional. Just an idiot on YouTube. So there you go. Come on then bud. I do that with him every time we've come for a walk down here. He's really good at it now. It's a little bit wild for him to get, but he's good at it. You know, so you sit, he waits, and only if he waits, then he gets to go mad, go bonkers, have some fun in the woods. Quite a simple concept really. Hello. Hello. Hello. You're going for some first one of a sudden. Hey, hey, hey. You always come a bit to the other side. You can't not be. Come on. Are you dead? Hey. Hey. Yeah. Hey. It's now like three o'clock on a bank holiday Monday. So nothing's going on. Just going to spend the afternoon chilling at home, not doing much of anything. I'm back at the day job tomorrow. So that'll be fun after like two in a bit weeks off. It's never fun. I do still have a day job. I did put a post up before Christmas saying I was looking for more part-time work. That's because I want to take steps away from the standard five days a week, nine to five this year, hopefully, and maybe focus on some other things. I'd like to focus more on the YouTube and just building a career that focuses on this sort of thing, a more creative style rather than a stuck in an office doing an office job, which is what I currently do. Yes, I do it from home, but it's a very office job job. It's not very creative at all really. So yeah, some plans, hopefully try and move things around this year and see what's what. So yeah. Then the only other real goal, unlike a lot of other people, need to lose a bit of timber, trim up a little bit, get back into the gym. Really want to work on my strength this year. You've been quite a strong dude a few years back, quite a while back. I've still got a little bit of that, but not as much as I did have. So this year, really going to work on that, trying to get nice and strong again, just because it's fun. I love that. I love that sort of lifting. I don't really do bodybuilding lifting a little bit of it, but I love lower reps, highway, all that sort of stuff. So some of that this year as well, work on the career, work on the YouTube channel, work on my fitness, strength, all that sort of stuff. That's it really. That my main plans. What are your plans? If you've got any plans, what you're focusing on, let me know down in the comment section below. If you like this style of video, you like a bit of vlogs, let me know down in the comments because more than sure about this sort of thing. Just never know how it's going to be received. So do let me know and let me know what you're getting up to and whether you had a good break. And I'll see you around on the channel very, very soon. Welcome to 2022. Let's all keep our fingers crossed that it's a better year for everyone. Take it easy. I'll see you next time.
