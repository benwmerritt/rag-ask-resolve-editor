What up, folks? It's me. It's Alex. It's Sunday. It's currently half seven. I was due to go out today. I was going to go out and film something. This video I wanted to do. So I was going to go out and about, film some cool stuff, and then it started raining. So I decided to do a real quick talking head, sort of channel update video tonight and just fill you in with what's been going on. So first things first, big thank you to every single one of you once again. Last time I made a video like this was when I hit 30,000 subscribers and the other day we hit 40,000 subscribers. So we now have 40, well actually we've got 41,000 subscribers now, but recently we hit 40k on this here YouTube channel. So massive thank you to every single one of you once again. All you newbies, all the 10,000 that have recently joined within the past, I don't know, a couple of months or whatever it's been. Welcome. Thanks for joining. I hope you've been enjoying the channel and to everyone else that subscribed way back when I was at 1,000 or 2,000 or 20,000, 30,000. Thanks for sticking around. Means the world to me that the channel's doing this well. So yeah, it's awesome. How cool is that? 40,000 people. Oh, last summer I did this. I said that we were now bigger than certain countries. So what countries are we bigger than now? So we are bigger than Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein has a population of 37,815 people and we've got 41,000. So we are the eighth smallest country in the world if we're all to get together and live on an island. There you go. How cool is that? Thank you all for joining me. Thank you for the support, the comments, the watches, the thumbs up, everything else that you guys do for the channel, guys and girls. I call everyone a dude whether you're a guy or a girl. But anyway, as always, thank you to everyone that has joined up to the YouTube channel so you can become a member of this channel now. £4.99 a month or $4.99 a month. Thank you to everyone that uses the Buy Me Coffee. As always, that's massively appreciated. Give a real shout out is a guy called Paul. Paulard there. I'll link his photography website down below so you can go have a look at him if you're UK based and you're looking for a studio photographer. He reached out to me with an email and just said, hey dude, really enjoy what you do. I've used tutorials to make some videos for my gliding club. Do you fancy coming out and having a go on one of the gliders? So I did. Right, we're just waiting for the guy to come on over now. So if you don't know what a glider is, it's a big plastic airplane without an engine. Basically, you get towed up by an actual airplane with an engine and then they let go. And you just glide about until you land. Now I've said it out loud. It doesn't fill me with confidence, but I have trust in these guys. They seem to know what they're doing. There's loads of them about. I haven't said anything crash yet and I've been here for a whole 10 minutes. So it should be fine. I had a great time, survived, which is the main thing. And yeah, it's one of those experiences which I'm glad I did. I'm going to try and maintain or at least attempt a three video per week schedule. So Friday is obviously the DaVinci Resolve stuff. We've got a five minute Friday. If I have any sort of more time during the week, I'll do a longer DaVinci Resolve video as well. Because they go down quite well. I know people like to see a bit of fusion stuff. So that's going to be cool. So yeah, we'll keep doing the DaVinci Resolve stuff. Don't worry. That's not going away anytime soon. I'd like to do a techie video sort of midweek. I'm thinking Tuesday, Wednesday. I've been sent a few bits. I've got this really cool tank of a light beast. This is a pocket light f7 fold. So I need to talk about that briefly. I need to make a video on that and I've got a few other bits. The techie stuff, the techie midweek reviews, it's all going to be related to video. So I've got my camera. I need to talk a little bit more about my lens. I use the Samyang 18 mil. Really great vlogging lens. It's really affordable for full frame Sony's. So I want to do a review on that. And then mics and lights. So that's going to be that midweek thing. It's not just going to be random stuff that you guys won't be interested in. It will be video related. I also want to talk more about some of the services I use. I obviously spoke about buying my coffee the other week. I use a thing called TubeBuddy. You can check the link down below. I've been on and off that since I started my YouTube channel. Honestly, I use it and then I don't think I need it. So I cancel it and then I miss it and then I sign up again. But I'm going to talk about that at some point as well. And then you've got all the music-y things and this, that and the other. I'm going to try and do those every week, but we'll see how it sort of goes with scheduling. And then the third video is actually going to be at the start of the week. So I've done this the wrong way around really. And that's just going to be whatever I fancy. I enjoy doing this stuff. I really enjoy doing the vintage result videos. You come up with cool ideas and that's creative, but I don't really get to flex and have fun creating videos when it's just tutorials. The tutorials are really cool. I do enjoy doing them. But I want to go out and just film more and have some more fun, which is why I've started doing a few little vlogs here and there. So there'll be one video a week where it'll be whatever I fancy making. Maybe it'll be a vlog. Maybe it'll be a review of something that's not related to video. It's not related to anything at all. You know how much I love my electric skateboard, my x-way. I bike a lot. Something like that once a week. You can choose to ignore it if you don't want to watch it. Talking about the biking, because I know some of you guys are MTB people yourself, you mountain bikers. I've got to show you this. So I started wearing my DJI action to take some video. I went to a bike park the other week, four on seven bike park in the UK. And, um, well, this happened. Oh, Nothing really too damaged. Feel a little bruised. Mainly my ego, to be honest. However, I wasn't damaged. The bike was. So the bike was a bit bent about to buy new handlebars and new front forks, which is very, very annoying. But there you go. So that's it for this video. I just wanted to do a quick Sunday night update. I might try and do more of these if you enjoy just my head. Thanks ever so much guys and girls, dude and dudeettes. As always, look after yourselves. Stay safe. All that good stuff. And I'll, um, I'll see you soon. Take it easy, folks. Thanks for watching. See ya. Bye.
