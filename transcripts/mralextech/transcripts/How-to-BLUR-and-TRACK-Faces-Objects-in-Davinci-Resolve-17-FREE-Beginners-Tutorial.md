I don't even mean to do it. Something just comes over me. I see people in the street and I just can't help myself and just What's up folks don't forget to like and subscribe all my friends have left me. I've got a family left Just me on my own my YouTube channel Don't forget to like and subscribe What up folks Alex here, Mr. Alex Tech in the air so have a look at how to blur faces in DaVinci Resolve Now this will work on both the free and the paid studio versions and what I say blur faces Well, you can actually use this technique to blur basically anything you need just use different shapes But follow the exact same process and as a bonus tip, I'll just show you how to discuss their voices wrong So let's open DaVinci Resolve and take a look. So here we are on the edit page of DaVinci Resolve I've got a couple of examples set up and ready to go So let's get to it The first thing I'm going to do give this first clip a click on the timeline and then we're going to jump directly into the color page Now we're going to do all the work for this on the color page Just because it's the quickest easiest way that I found to do this sort of thing now The first thing you want to do just make sure you've got your nodes open on the right-hand side here If you can't see this sort of gray grid area Just click on nodes up in the top right hand corner just to display those like so Now all we're going to do is going to use a little window to track my face and then we can blur that out So in this menu right in the middle here, you want to click on this icon this little circle Give that a click This is the window tab and then you've got a bunch of different windows that you can select from here now We're going to use this circle because most faces around so we're going to grab this one Just give it a click and it's going to show on the preview window here like so on the off chance You don't have it appear underneath the preview window You've got this little drop down Just make sure that you're on the power window and then you'll be able to see this window and then all we're going to do is Drop this on my face. So I'm going to drag this put it on my face roughly there Using these little dots on the corners and the edges just resize this so it's on the face a little bit better Now we can also just feather it or add a bit of a softness to the edge by grabbing the little red dots You can see there's just a slight red outline and that will just make that more feathered or less feathered But I'm just going to go with something like that Once that's done back to this middle menu here. Click on the next one It's like a little bullseye a target and that's for your tracker make sure that you're on tracker window There's three little icons here. You want this one on the left hand side again It's like a little bullseye and then you've got some options now I recommend that you turn off perspective 3d You don't need this to be tracking in 3d and 3d quite often just mess things up and makes things do weird things So just keep pan tilt zoom and rotate enabled but untick perspective 3d And then all you want to do is click this icon here the back and forth arrows And what it will do is just track your face in real time Like so easy peasy now if I just skim along you can see it's done a pretty good job of tracking my face So now all we need to do is apply the blur and there's two different types of blur which work really well for this So let me show you those so for the first type of blur We're just going to give this icon a click here which conveniently is labeled blur and then on this radius We're just going to grab this little bar right in the middle and drag it upwards now It looks like it only goes to one but actually you can keep dragging all the way up to get that as blurry as you like So I'm going to go with about one hit play and you can see it's tracking my face and blurring it as we go So that looks pretty good now the other type of blur is a mosaic blur, which is that pixelated star blur So I'm just going to reset this radius by clicking on this little twirly icon to apply the mosaic blur Simply open the effects in the top right hand corner And then you've got this full list here right at the very top You've got mosaic blur just grab that and drop that onto your node here So we're just clicking dragging our mouse and then releasing and that will put this mosaic blur on my face Within the effects area here You've got things like pixel frequency so you can change the size of the pixels and there's a few other options in there Just have a play with them getting it looking exactly as you want it I'm going to keep it as the square like so and if we hit play you can see it's doing a pretty good job And that's it really simple, but there are a few other things which can catch you out So let me show you those as well This example is just a little bit different because I'm sat further away from the screen and then I move into it like so So let's just do the same thing and we'll see what this does So I've got my node ready. I'm going to hop onto the window grab a circle We'll resize this get it on my face That will do and we're going to hop into the tracker Perspective 3d is turned off. So we're going to use this back and forth We use this back and forth one because then it doesn't matter where we are within the actual clip It will track forwards and backwards making sure that everything has been tracked So we'll give that a click it's going to track all the way forwards for us And then it'll go right to the beginning and track all the way back and if we just skip through let's have a look Now it's done a pretty good job But at this point here when it's moved towards the screen, it's just got a little bit too big But don't worry that's easy to fix as well What you want to do in this tracker window and chop right-hand corner You've got clip and you've got frame change that to say frame by changing clip to frame That allows us to add key frames for every single frame within this footage So we can actually just change the power window size and location all the way through the clip to make sure that this lines up perfectly So what I'm going to do down here in this little window It's going to drag this little playhead To a point where it looks like it gets a bit big so it starts to grow bigger about here And then I'm just going to add this little key frame But by clicking on this little diamond over on the right hand side and that'll add a little key frame just up here and Then about here you can see this is the point where it's got to its largest edge biggest size So we're just going to resize it move it back over to my face. I can rotate it if I want to Like so and now if we keep scrolling forward you can see from then on it's much smaller It's following my face really well, and it's doing a really good job So now we'll just drop the mosaic blur on that one We can hit play and job done It's tracked us and it's doing a pretty good job easy peasy, right? Well, what happens if you want to track more than one face? That's easy as well So in this clip there's these two lovely old deers going for a little bit of a walk And we want to blur their faces and it's exactly the same process you just do it twice So I'm going to grab the power window grab my circle We're just going to put this on this little lady's face over here for starters Make this a bit smaller that will do tracker everything's good to go. Let's track this That looked pretty good drag the mosaic blur drop on a node done that ladies done now We just right click on my node. I'm going to add a node I'm going to add a serial node which would just give us another node Afterwards and then we just repeat the process. So I'm going to grab a window circle Resize this drop it on the chap's face tracker forwards and back Mosaic blur slap it on there job done now If you've got footage with a color grade on as you can see I do here exactly the same thing Just right click on your last node add a node add a serial and then just repeat the exact same process on this Final node add your mosaic blur and you're good to go now for one final quick trick There's no point blur in the face unless you disguise the voice as well. That takes two seconds So let's do that as well. I'm back here on the edit page I'm just going to give this footage a click on the timeline Open up the inspector go to the audio tab at the very top Then all you need to do under pitch where you've got semi tones You can deepen the voice by bringing this to the left to the negative numbers But you can actually increase the pitch of the voice by taking it to the right. I want to go left So I'm going to go down minus five and now we've got this What's up, folks? It's Alex here. Let's try this trick and I've just discovered this super quick and that's it easy as that Thanks for watching. Take it easy. I'll catch you next time See ya
