Alex Tech folks, Alex here, Mr. Alex Tech, and welcome to the very first episode of Mr. Alex Tech News, a weekly video where I just took about the news. So it's going to be mainly DaVinci Resolve, but if there's anything else interesting that I think it's worth talking about, I'm going to talk about it and hopefully you'll find it interesting. Now say weekly, this is the first one. It'll be weekly if people like it, people watch it and people want to see more. So do let me know down in the comments if you do enjoy this video. Right, let's crack on with the news. The first bit DaVinci Resolve 17.4.1 is upon us. It was released on Friday, so two days ago today at the time of recording. Now that's only one week following the 17.4 update which was released last Friday. Now that was a really big update. It brought loads of cool stuff like the ability to render using hardware acceleration on the free version of DaVinci Resolve on Windows, which is a big thumbs up from me. Some other cool additions like the ability to do YouTube chapters and then some performance upgrades for the M1 and the brand new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips that Apple have just released. So what does this 17.4.1 upgrade include? Nothing anywhere near as exciting, unfortunately. It's mostly just bug fixes. We've got things like improved frame based imports from Finder. Don't really know what that means, but that fixed it. Addressed an issue with HDR on Viewers on Mac. Addressed an issue with banding on Video Clean Feed on Mac. Addressed incorrect fades when trimming in the edit timeline. Plus a load of other stuff in the bottom. General performance and stability improvements. Now I've installed it. It's all up and running. I've had no real issues, so it is available now if you want to go and download it. Again, use your place. Jump over to the support website or open Resolve. Click on DaVinci Resolve and you can download it directly from there. If you do download it, let me know if you have any performance increases, decreases, bugs, whatever, pop them down in the comments below. Share the love with the world. Newspiece number two. Two. News number two. Blackmagic Design announces price reduction on DaVinci Resolve keyboards and panels. So now is an excellent time to be buying some Blackmagic hardware. Or is it? Well, that really depends on exactly what you're buying. Because while this is overall good news, they have snuck in a tiny little nugget of bad news as well. So let's go through the changes. DaVinci Resolve is still free. Good. Excellent. Imagine the uproar if they change that. DaVinci Resolve Studio now costs $295. That's pretty much the same as it was. The DaVinci Resolve Editor keyboard, however, that's down to just $595. That's a saving of $400. That's really significant. That's basically a half price. When I first got my hands on one of these Resolve Editor keyboards about a year or so ago, I had it for a month to play with. They were about a grand. So coming down to $595 is a really good price. It's a solid piece of kit. Then you've got the DaVinci Resolve Micro Panel for $795. That's the same as give $200. And then the DaVinci Resolve Mini Panel, that's down to $1,995, a saving of $1,000. So that all sounds good. Lots of hardware that's reduced in price so that you guys can pick it up for a little bit cheaper. So what's the snag? What's the bad news? Well, the DaVinci Resolve Speed Editor has a price increase. That's gone up $100 and that's now available for $395. But the speed editor used to be free, I hear you ask. Yes, that bundle, that offer has now stopped. A year ago when they released the Speed Editor, you could get the Speed Editor for free when you purchased the DaVinci Resolve Studio for $295. But that offer has now ended. So if you want the Speed Editor, you need to go out and grab it for $395. But there is some good news that does still include a DaVinci Resolve Studio license. So you can still get the both for a total of $395. Here's a quote from Grant Petty, who is the CEO of Blackmagic. The launch special offer of a free DaVinci Resolve Speed Editor with the purchase of DaVinci Resolve Studio has been incredibly popular. So we've decided to replace this and include a DaVinci Resolve Studio license with the DaVinci Resolve Speed Editor. It's just so fast to edit and color grade without a mouse and keyboard and a lot of fun to use. We hope even more customers are now able to benefit from using them. So there you go. Not too bad, really. We knew this offer was going to come to an end at some point. $395 for the Speed Editor is still not a bad price. It could have been really expensive though. $400 is not too bad and it does include that $300 license within it as well. So you can kind of think of it that you're paying $200 each. You're paying $200 for the license and then $200 for the Speed Editor. Now it's also worth mentioning that you do also get the DaVinci Resolve license with the full size keyboard, the micro panel and the mini panel, which adds a bit of a conundrum if you haven't yet picked up a Speed Editor, but you've been eyeing one up because now there's only $200 between the Speed Editor or the full fat DaVinci Resolve Editor keyboard. Now of course, I've had a chance to play with them both in the past, which do I recommend? It's kind of hard to say they both do different things. The Speed Editor is of course much smaller, much more portable and it's wireless. So that's really nice if you dabble. You just want to grab it out of a drawer, put it on your desk, use a little bit of it and then get it out of the way, maybe take it with you, use it with a laptop, that sort of thing. The full DaVinci Resolve keyboard however, that's obviously much bigger, heavier and it's wired. The wheel is nice. It's got a proper clutch in it so you can have end points on there and it's a full mechanical keyboard. It also has more shortcuts on it because it covers all of the shortcuts across all of the keys on your keyboard. So it does offer that little bit more. Whether it offers $200 worth of additional value is entirely up to you, but for 500, well, 600 bucks is a much easier sell than the original price of a thousand bucks. And the final piece of news this week, the Coridol crew are actively using DaVinci Resolve to edit and composite some of their videos, which for me is really, really cool. Now, if you don't know who Coridol crew are, they're a collection of visual effects artists that have been making really interesting videos over on their YouTube channel for a couple of years now. And they do a big variety of really cool videos from really unique standalone original shorts to VFX breakdowns, reaction videos and all that sort of fun stuff. One of my favorite series is called the VFX Artist Reveals. It's by one of the guys over there called Ren and he uses visual effects to explain really complicated things like how big is the universe, how much water is there on earth and how many balloons do you need to lift up the uphouse in real life. So I'd highly recommend going and checking those out. But anyway, they're using DaVinci Resolve. Now, this isn't new news. I think they've been using DaVinci Resolve for a while, but it's just really cool to see if you're a bit of a nerd like me, loves using DaVinci Resolve. It's really nice seeing it put to use in a different way. They did a recent video linked down below where they did a reimagining of the Star Wars lightsaber battle. It's a great video. The end result is awesome and the breakdown of how they coordinated and filmed and edited everything is really worth a watch. But the most interesting thing is they did the lightsaber glow in DaVinci Resolve Fusion. They did it using a couple of basic masks, 3D KIA and then just a simple glow effect. But the end result is really, really awesome. So it's definitely worth taking a look at the breakdown. Now, of course, I'm just a big fan of the channel, so seeing them using DaVinci Resolve was just really, really cool to see. I might delve into Fusion a little bit and try and figure out exactly how they made that lightsaber effect so I can replicate it and make a little video on this channel. If you'd like to see that, please do let me know down in the comment section below. And that's it. That's the news for this week. Hope you enjoyed this video. Let me know any thoughts, feelings, opinions, whatever. I'm doing a little dance, done away. Thanks for watching. See you next time. Take it easy. Bye. News.
