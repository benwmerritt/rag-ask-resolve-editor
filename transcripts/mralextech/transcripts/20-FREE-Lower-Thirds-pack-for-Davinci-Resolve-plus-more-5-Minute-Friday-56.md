## Transcript
What up folks, it's Alex here and welcome to FreeBee Friday. This is a new series of five minute Friday style videos. I'm going to take five minutes to introduce you to a couple of free resources which are out there which you can start using in DaVinci Resolving in any other projects that you may have. Now don't worry, this isn't replacing the usual five minute Friday videos. Instead, I'm just going to throw them up intermittently when I found useful cool stuff while scouring the internet. So, let's crack on with it, shall we? The first one is by a long term friend of the channel, a chap called Sadi, and he runs a channel called Gargoyles at Work. Now you can just search for it on YouTube or there is a link down in the description below. Now Sadi is an absolute whiz at Fusion and he's created loads of elements and tutorials for you guys to use. So as you can see here, we've got animated backgrounds, we've got intro animations, we've got different particles. There's loads of really great stuff on his channel so you should definitely check him out. Now the thing that we're most interested in is this here called Avalon. Now Avalon is a lower thirds pack that contains 20 really nice, really professional lower thirds that you can download and start using in DaVinci Resolve. They're really well put together and they're really nicely animated and they use free fonts. Sadi's actually put together everything you need to be able to start using these. Head over to the video, click on show more. There's some links on how to download it and within there there's also install instructions as well. So there's everything you need straight off the bat. So head over to GodGirls at Work, say hello from me, make sure to like and subscribe. This is just a regular dude doing the same thing as I am and he's giving stuff out for free. So definitely show him some love if you enjoy his pack. Now I'm not gonna show you how to install them or how to use them because someone else is already beating me to it and that is John's Films. So John at John's Films has already made a video showing you how to use them, how to install them and all that sort of thing. That's linked down in the description as well. So again, if you enjoy his video, if you find it useful, seeing how to install them and how to use them, give John some love as well. Number two, free music from HelloThematic. Now I've used HelloThematic a few times in the past. I've since signed up to motion around using them and paying for a subscription. I'm giving them a trial out at the moment so I'm getting my music from there. But I've used HelloThematic quite a bit in the past and they have a really cool, nice, awesome selection for free music which you can use on YouTube. You have to be a YouTube creator because you're logging via your Google account. But once you're in, you can browse on the music, you can download what you want and you can use it on your YouTube channel. You do have to put a credit in your description but it gives you that straight away. You just copy it, paste it into your description on your video and you're good to go. Now there's other resources out there for free music but I really like the selection on HelloThematic. It feels like it's made by real artists that are putting it out there rather than just very generic music which someone's made available for free. So I'd highly recommend if you're a YouTuber looking for some free music, head over to HelloThematic, sign in and have a look at some of the stuff on there. Now number three for this week is a Anamorphic Lens Flare Pack brought to you by Premium Beat. Anamorphic lenses are used in cinema very often and they basically give you a very wide, elongated lens flare which looks really quite cool. So there's 17 completely free Anamorphic Lens Flare overlays which you can download, import into your DaVinci Resolve and start using. It's a nice effect for certain situations and it works best at night when you've got a bright main light source. So think of cars driving down the street at night or street lamps or a monitor or a TV in a darkened room. That sort of thing, that's when you might want to start using these Anamorphic Lens Flare. Now they actually work in exactly the same way as my Lens Flare. So they talked about in my previous Five Minute Friday. That's linked down below. So you can check that out for some detailed instructions but for a real quick guide, once you download the pack, it's a dot zip. So just unpack that, you'll have a folder like so. And within there you've got your 17 Anamorphic Lens Flare. We can just drag them straight into DaVinci Resolve. Pick one that we want and put it on our timeline above our clip like so. Then give it a click, open up the inspector straight to the composite mode at the very top and then add or screen work really well but feel free to experiment, use any ones that you like. If I just put screen on, and we can see straight away, we've got this Lens Flare effect going on. You can also just adjust your opacity so you can lower it if it's coming on a bit strong for you whatever you want to do. Easy peasy. And that's it. I hope you find those things useful. If you do, give me a thumbs up. If you have any comments or feedback, pop them down below as always. And if you're new here, don't forget to subscribe. Thank you very much for watching. I'll be back next Friday for the usual five minute Friday but I've got some other things to come between them as well so make sure to keep your eye on the channel. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. Bye. Yeah.
