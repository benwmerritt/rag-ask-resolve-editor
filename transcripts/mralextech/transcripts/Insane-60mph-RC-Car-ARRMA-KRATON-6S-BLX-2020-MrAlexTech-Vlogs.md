I've been in your arms I thought you'd got a love I'm not looking for a show I've never been so close to being strong It's wrong to be around you, I've got a love I thought you'd got a love I thought you'd got a love Check it out, I got a new toy What up folks, it's Alex here, Mr Alex Tech Welcome back to the channel, and bit of a different video for you today I'm just talking about my brand new toy here This is an Armacraton 6S version 5 RC car It's a 1 1⁄8 scale electric remote control car That's capable of about 60 miles an hour Out the box, if you fit the additional speed gear Which I haven't yet, but even without that It's still capable of about 40, 50 ish miles an hour So it's absolutely rapid, and it's a monster And it's awesome, and I'm really excited about it Which is why I'm making a video to show you all It's a Truggy, they call it So it's not quite a muntz truck, it's not quite a buggy Somewhere in between, Truggy makes sense You can get me in either red or blue I'm in for the blue, just so I look cool The red looks cool as well, but let's go for the blue Open her up, and we're running Spectrum, Motor, Speed Controller And Steering Survey Couldn't tell you any of the specs about them, but there you go Link down below if you want to check out some of the jargon, it's all there All of that is then mounted to an aluminium chassis Now mine doesn't look default, I've put a skin on it Yeah, it offers a bit of protection, but I bought the skin just because it looked cool Honestly, and it does look pretty cool It adds a little bit of extra something to it Now as I mentioned, this is a 6S model Now if you don't know RC, that refers to the battery The more power, obviously, the faster you'll go Bigger ones, need more power, yada yada yada This is a 6S, you can run it on 4S, which is what I've been doing It'll still hit 40 miles an hour on 4S But you'll get the full acceleration and the full top speed on 6S Now, I always wanted one of these as a kid I always wanted the Remoka Truck, and we could never afford one So I'm sort of just reliving my missed youth by buying one I feel like a big kid again, but it is awesome It's taken some knocks already, as you can probably see But I absolutely love it, it's bloody brilliant, I'm having a great time with it So it gives me something to do when I'm at home I can take it apart, I can tinker, I can upgrade it, I can mess with bit Which is loads of fun And as I used to tinker with cars, I used to modify cars back in the day So it feels like that, I can just take things apart and mess with it, which is always good fun So, enough of all that, let's throw up some footage so you can have a look at this thing in action And let me know what you think So there it is, my new toy I plan to create some more videos and take some photos of it, just have fun with this thing Because it's given me something extra to focus on, honestly, something different And I think we all need that at the moment Maybe DaVinci Resolve is that thing that you're focusing on to distract you from everything that's going on the world If it's not and you're looking for something, find something Doesn't matter what it is, doesn't matter whether you return to being a child, you're buying a new toy like I have Or you just start to learn something I think we all need to find that additional thing to focus on Just to try and get us through this rut that was 2020 and is now ongoing into 2021 So, yeah, doesn't matter what it is, doesn't matter what people think Find yourself a new toy, find yourself something that puts a smile on your face Like I have, and let's crack on and see how we get on in 2021 Let me know what you think of this, if you'd like to see some more videos of this on this channel Let me know, I probably won't do loads on this channel with this thing because it's a bit niche I have got another channel which I will link down in the description below And maybe I'll post stuff over there But if you'd like to see more RC stuff on this channel, let me know Maybe I'll just post it on here instead I do plan on doing more vlogs and all that sort of stuff here So this is the first, hopefully, of many And yeah, we'll just play it by ear Thanks for watching, folks Take it easy, we'll catch you next time See ya!
