If there's just one keyboard shortcut with individual resolve that everyone needs to change, it's this. This allows you to do simple cuts, these awesome ripple cuts both forwards and backwards and the essential undo without moving your left hand. That makes cutting your videos together much easier and much quicker. In this video, I'm going to show you how to set that up. I'm also going to explain the keyboard customization screen in just a little bit more detail, and I'm going to show you a bunch of my other favorite essential beginner friendly keyboard shortcuts for the venture resolve. But first, I need to thank this video sponsor, Audio. Audio is a music subscription service that has all of the music and sound effects that you could need and they have options for everyone. If it's a monthly subscription you need, you can get started with their creators license, which is available for just $14.99 a month. If you need everything they have to offer, why not go for the annual pro license, which you can get for just 59 bucks for your first year. Or if it's only music you need, you can get lifetime access to the entire audio music library for just a one off payment of 199 bucks. Well, I can check the links down below. Right, let's kick things off with the basics, the absolute essential keyboard shortcuts you need to know to get working in the venture resolve. And the very first one, super quick and simple, the spacebar. The spacebar will allow you to simply play and pause on your timeline like so. Now the left and right arrow keys allow you to scrub through your timeline one frame at a time. So you can keep tapping it like so to go forwards with the right arrow key or backwards with the left, or you can hold them down to scrub through like so. The up and down arrow keys allow you to jump between your edit points really quickly. So you can just whip through your timeline really quickly like so. Or we'll jump backwards on the timeline, well down, we'll jump forwards. Alternatively, there's the J, K and L keys. Now imagine that this little button here is J. This one here is K. And this one here is L. So I've hit the L key, it's simply going to play forward. If we hit K, it's going to stop. And if we hit J, it's going to play backwards. Now the joy of this, if we hit J once again, it's now going to play back at two X speed. Hit it again, 4x, 8x, 16, and 32. You can also play forwards and backwards in slow motion. If we hold down the K button, which is this stop, and then hold down L as well, we can then play forwards timeline at 0.5 speed. If we hold K and then hold J, we can play backwards at 0.5 speed. Now if we give a piece of footage to click, let's go with this one here. And then we use the full stop and comma keys, we can actually shift this footage forwards and backwards on the timeline by just a single frame. It's a real nice easy way of doing real fine adjustments. Now it's worth noting that works on edit points as well. So if I move my mouse over this edit point until my cursor looks like this and then give it a click, then we can use the comma and the full stop once again to move this edit point forwards and back to get it in the exact right position. Control and S by the way, does a real quick save. The vintage resolves pretty good at saving your work automatically, but it's good to know. And there you have the basics to play forwards and back and scrub through your timeline effectively, just using the keyboard. Now the next one I want to talk about is the Alt key, which is option if you're on a Mac. I can't talk about keyboard shortcuts with intervention resolve without talking about this key, because it is pretty magic. And the first example is this, if I grab some footage from a media pool, bring onto my timeline, you can see there is both video and audio. However, if we hold down the Alt key, click it from within the media pool and they're dragged down, you can see that we only get the video, which is just a handy way of bringing in the video only without the audio. Now you can do the opposite of that by holding shift, grabbing your footage, bringing it in, and then you're only going to select the audio and not the video bonus tip. I brought this footage in and it's just the video without the audio, but I've later decided I do want the audio. You can actually get it really quickly by using the F key, which is called match frame. So I'm going to give this footage a click on my timeline so that it's highlighted. And then we're going to hit the F key. And it's going to find this exact point within the main source video from my media pool. And it's going to mark these little in and out points to say this is the section you need. And then if I just click on my preview window and drag down, I can get the entire thing. So that's the video and the audio. Or if we use the same keyboard shortcuts as before. So I hold alt and drag, we can bring in just the video, or hold shift and drag, and we can just bring down the audio. If you've just brought down the audio, you can then highlight them both on the timeline, right click, and then go to link clips. And now they're linked once again, and ready to go. Now going back to my favorite alt key, these are obviously linked. So if I move the audio, the video will come with it. However, if we hold down the alt key, and then click on the video, we can select them independently. So then I can just move the video without moving the audio. This timer will actually show you how far they are apart, what the difference is between them. But they are actually still linked. So then if I give this a click without holding down the alt key, we can still move them together like so. But if we hold alt, click, and then drag, we can move them independently to get them however we want them. If we hold down the alt key, click on this video, and then keep the alt key held down, we can then duplicate things. So I can duplicate this video as many times as I like, just by clicking and dragging and keeping the alt key held. That's a really useful one to copy videos, audio, transitions, effects, pictures, pretty much anything on the timeline you can duplicate by holding alt, clicking, and dragging. Winner. And the very last alt key one I want to show you is simply by holding the alt key, and then scrolling your mouse wheel, you can zoom in and out of the timeline, which is super handy to get a better look at the timeline, and then zooming into the detail you're looking at. There's also another bonus tip here. If you zoom into whatever point you like, so I'm going to go with something like this, because I'm doing some fine adjustments, let's say, but I want to look at my timeline as a whole. If we hold shift and hit Z, we can see the entire timeline, and then shift and Z once again, and then we can jump back to that point we were before. And this will remember whatever zoom level you're at. So if I zoom out a little bit, let's go with this, we'll shift Z, see everything, shift Z, we're back to this point, zoom right in, shift Z, shift Z, and job done. Now the Z key is also super useful for looking at your preview window up here. So if I use my mouse scroll wheel, I can zoom in and zoom out. And if I click my wheel in, I can move this around. So it's really handy to be able to look in at some fine details within the preview window. To get that back to exactly as it was, simply hit the Z key, and it'll just reset that. So no matter what I do, I can hit Z to get back to where I was. Simple. That was a lot, I know, but the Alt key is super useful. And being able to zoom in and out, reset your preview and have a look at the timeline from different levels, they're all super useful. And hopefully that's not too difficult to remember. Next up, I want to show you some simple shortcuts for doing cuts, and then deleting clips and deleting spaces on your timeline with something called the ripple delete. And then we're going to get into customizing our keyboard shortcuts with this super handy one I hinted at at the beginning. So the default keyboard shortcut to do razors or splits or cuts or whatever you want to call it is control and B. So if I just put my playhead wherever I want the cut to happen, and I'll hit control and B, it'll do a big cut through the timeline like so. Now it's important to note, let me just duplicate this using my Alt and drag. If we don't have anything selected, so none of the clips are highlighted in red, we'll do a control and B, it will cut through the entire timeline. So it's kind of slicing all the way through. If we select the footage first, so this one is highlighted in red, and then we do a control B, it's only going to make the cut on that one particular clip we had selected, and not the entire timeline. Now if you want to delete a clip, you just give it a click, and then we hit the backspace key, which is the delete key on a Mac, the one at the top right hand corner of your keyboard. And that's just going to delete the clip like so on this one, we're going to do the exact same thing backspace. And it's going to delete that like so. But it leaves a big gap. So that is what's called the standard delete. Now let me just undo with control and Z. Another handy shortcut. If we wanted to delete this clip, and automatically close this gap, so bringing everything from the right hand side over to the left, on Windows, you'd use the delete key rather than the backspace key. And if you're on a Mac, you do shift and delete. And that will just delete that and close that gap. Now it's also worth mentioning, if I just did a standard delete on this, and I had this empty space here, you can actually click on the empty space, and it will highlight it in this light gray. And then I can hit delete or ripple delete to delete that and close that gap. Super quick word of warning when doing ripple delete with multiple tracks. So I've got two tracks set up here. If I was to give this clip a click, and then do a ripple delete, it's also going to affect things on the other tracks, it's going to shift everything over to the left, which can mess up your edit. Two quick ways to resolve this, you can either click on these little padlocks on the left hand side. So I'm going to lock these two. So then they're not affected by anything at all. If I was to give this a click and then ripple delete, you can see these locks tracks will stay exactly as they are. The downside, because they're locked, I can't actually click and do anything on them at all, until we unlock them by clicking on the padlocks once again. Alternatively, what you can do is turn off this auto track selector. So we're going to give those a click. Now we can still actually do any edits, we can still do what we want with these clips, but any ripple deletes won't affect those tracks. So there's two ways to prevent it. I just wanted to let you know that that can happen. Easy. So that's your simple cuts, delete and ripple deletes, but you can actually combine the entire process into one single keyboard shortcut. Well, technically two, it's called the ripple end to playhead and ripple start to playhead. And the shortcuts are control shift open bracket, and control shift close bracket, which is kind of fiddly, which is why we're going to reassign them in a moment. But let me show you how it works. So we've already got an edit point here, I've already done a little cut. And if we move a playhead over to this point here, let's say we want to make a cut and then also ripple delete this section. So rather than doing a cut a click and then a delete, which does work, we're going to combine the entire process into one. Now it's control shift and then the open bracket or the close bracket, you use the open bracket, which is obviously on the left, if you want to close to the left, and you use the close bracket, which is the one to the right, if you want to close to the right of the playhead. So in this instance, we want to do a cut, and we want to close to the left. So we're going to do control shift, and then the open bracket, and it's just going to close that gap. So it's going to go from wherever the playhead is to the previous edit point. If we wanted to do it the other way, so let's move our playhead right over here. And we want to make a cut here, and then delete this entire section up to this edit point. We go into the right of the playhead. So we would do control shift close bracket, the one on the right, and it close that gap for us like so. But as mentioned, it's kind of fiddly, you've got fingers all over the place. It's not particularly useful. So we're going to reassign those. Now there are a few different ways to do this. Some people prefer to use like QWNE or ASD. My personal preference is one, two, and three. So one will close to the left of the playhead. Number two, it's just a simple cut right down the middle. And number three will close to the right of the playhead. And it just makes life way, way easier. I also really like using one, two, three because the tilled key, which is the one to the left of the number one, top left of your keyboard, that's the undo key as well. So you can do control z to undo, or you can use the tilled key. I think it's called tilled or tilled or something like that. Same location on Mac, but there's no tilled. I have no idea what these symbols are, but you know, is that one hit that one up there. So basically you've got undo with your little finger, one, two, and three. So you can do real fast cuts and closes and undoes with your four fingers. Now quick warning, the one, two, and three keys currently are assigned to multi cams. Again, I don't really do multi cams, which is why I go for this option. If you do loads of multi cams, you may need to reassign them to something else. But I'm going to show you how I do it. Because that's how I do it. So let's have a look. So anywhere within DaVinci Resolve, or you do click on DaVinci Resolve, top left hand corner, and then click on keyboard customization. And the keyboard customization window will appear. Now super quick tour of this screen, you've got presets in the top right hand corner. So you can just pick and choose those. We'll come back to those in a moment. Then you've got this virtual keyboard. So you can either click on the keys on screen. So if we click on you, it's going to show me what you does within this active key area. So you can see the individual panels on the left, you can see application, the you does edit point type on the right, you've got a big list of all of the individual commands and the different pages. If we click on this edit point type, it's going to actually jump to that exact area. So then we could reassign that if we wanted to. Alternatively, by the way, rather than clicking on this virtual keyboard, you can just hold the keys down on your own physical keyboard. On the left, you've also got these modifier keys. So if you wanted shift to be held down, you want to see what shift and T is, you can just click those shift and T is add audio only transition. And that's kind of how this screen works. So we need to start to reassign some stuff. So the first one control, I'm going to hit control with my modifier and hit B. That is of course, razor, which does that splits. So we're going to click on razor, and it's going to automatically jump to razor. And you can see it's control B. I do want to keep the control B keyboard shortcut, but I want to add a second one. So we're just going to click on the little plus. It's going to give us a red box. And then I'm going to hit the number two key. And it's going to say number two is already assigned to clip, multi cam cut to angle. Do you want to assign this keystroke? I'm just going to click assign simple. Next one we want is obviously control, shift. And then it's this open bracket, which is start to play head, we'll give that click. It's going to jump to the right area here. Control shift. I don't actually need that anymore. So rather than assigning an additional keyboard shortcut, we're just going to click the X to get rid of that one. And then we've got a little red box. This is obviously the one to the left. So we're going to hit number one. It's going to give us a warning once again, I'll just click assign. And then enter playhead is just above, we'll get rid of that one, click in the box. Number three, assign and job done. Now, we do have some overlaps, which is why we've got these exclamation points. If we click on the exclamation point, it will actually show us what the overlap is. So you can see here, it starts a playhead and cut to angle one. To get rid of those, just to tidy it up, I'm going to go to my cut to angle one, two and three. Again, I don't use these often. So I'm actually just going to get rid of them. You could reassign them if you wanted to, or you could use a different keyboard shortcut, whatever you want to do. I just want to show you how this works for me. Then we're simply going to hit save. We have to give this a name. So I'm just going to call this 123. And then click, okay. Now, just before you close the screen, if you click on these presets again in the top right hand corner, you can see DaVinci Resolve is still there. So that default one still exists. It's really easy to jump back to if you need to. But we go to 123. We've got our start to playhead. Everything is all assigned. Perfect. We'll hit save. Now, just with my left hand, I can hit number two to make these cuts. This is a perfect example. There's loads of empty space here. So we're going to go right to the end, hit number one. It's going to close that gap for us. And if we went over to this point here, I want to make a cut here and get rid of this point. We can hit number three. Actually, I've changed my mind. We'll use my pinky finger to do one undo and undo. And you can just use your left hand tilled 123. So really quickly do cuts, closing down this timeline to edit much, much quicker. Left hand on those numbers. And then you can use the right hand either on your mouse. So we would like to click through the timeline, we can use your right hand on the J, K and L keys to really quickly scrub through your timeline. It's a really, really efficient way to edit. Or alternatively, you could buy either one of these. This is the Blackmagic Speed Editor. And this is the Blackmagic Full Editors keyboard. If you want to know more about these, stick around because we're going to be doing good comparison on the channel very, very soon. I hope this video was useful. I hope you found good stuff within this here presentation. I don't know. But thanks ever so much for watching. Take it easy. I'll catch you next time.
