The problem! This has all been keyed out using the 3D keyer. If I then go to the video tab within the inspector, try and zoom out. You can see the blackboard is going to come in, make it look like the video underneath is cropped, which isn't ideal. The solution! In the effects library, command down to open effects, scroll right the way down until you get to the resolve FX transform area and then there's a transform effect within there. Grab that and drop that onto your green screen on the timeline like so. Give it a click, open up the inspector, go to the effects area, you've got 3D keyer, just give that a click to minimize that. Open up this transform effect instead and then you've got zoom, simply adjust the slider to zoom out and that blackboard won't come in like so. You can then just adjust the X and Y position or the rotation if needs be to get it in the position that you need it. Now there might be another solution but that seems to do the trick and it's really quick and easy to do so hopefully it gets you all up and running.
