Transitions! There's tons of them even in the free version of DaVinci Resolve. From simple pushes and dissolves to glitch, mosaic, page curl and even burn. And if you think there are transitions missing, let me know because I'm on a mission to create some new transition packs for DaVinci Resolve so I need to know exactly what you want. Oh and before we get into it, this video is sponsored by Audio. Using the code alex199 you can get lifetime access to their entire music catalogue forever for just a one-off payment of $199. But more on those a little bit later. So first up, where exactly do you find these transitions in Resolve? Let's take a look. So here we are on the edit page with DaVinci Resolve and if we click on effects in the top left hand corner we'll open up our effects library down here. If we expand toolbox to make sure that's open and within there we've got video transitions and we've got audio transitions. Within our video transitions list we've got things like dissolve, iris, motion, shape and wipe. These are all your standard DaVinci Resolve transitions. If you keep scrolling down we've got these fusion transitions which are some really cool unique looking video transitions which you can use as well. And lastly right near the bottom we've got Resolve FX transitions and there's a nice burn away within there as well. So now you've found them, how exactly do you preview them? Well that's easy as well. If we put our playhead over the edit point we want to see the transition, we want to preview it. Then we're going to go to our video transitions, make sure to click on these three little dots and make sure your hover scrub preview is enabled and then you can simply hover your mouse over any of these transitions to preview the transition and see what it's going to look like on that edit point. If we move our playhead to a different edit point let's find a different transition. We can see what it's going to look like on that one instead. Now applying them is just as easy. So if I grab this center wipe I'm simply going to click my mouse, hold, drag and just drop it directly onto the edit point like so. Alternatively if you put your playhead near an edit point it doesn't even need to be on it, just needs to be close to any edit point on the timeline and then we can simply double click any of the transitions within the effects library and it'll automatically add that transition to that nearest edit point. So if we go to a different one over here double click on spiral wipe and it'll put it on there like so. You can even apply transitions to multiple different edit points in one go. All we need to do we click and hold our mouse and we select all of the edit points where we want to apply our transition. With that done we simply go to the effects library, find the transition that we want, we right click and then we add two selected edit points and clips and it'll drop the transition on all of those different edit points like so. If you want to get rid of any we can just give them a click, hit delete to delete them from our timeline. Easy. Next up alignment. I know I've done this a million times. You've dropped the transition on there, you've put it on slightly the wrong place and you want to move it either to the middle to the right or to the left. Well by default when you click and drag it won't move which seems like you're going to have to delete it and start again but you don't. If you simply right click on the transition on the timeline there's three options at the top. Start on edit which will put it over on the right hand side, there's end on edit which will be on the left hand side and center on edit which will put it right in the middle. Alternatively with the transition highlighted open up the inspector, top right hand corner and there's these three alignment buttons which do the same thing. Left hand side, center, right hand side. But what about when your transition just won't apply? Well that's due to something called handles. So if I grab any of my transitions it won't go on this point. No matter what I do I can't add this transition here. I can add it over here just not on this transition point. And why is that? Well DaVinci Resolve needs a bit of overlap so there's actually no additional footage to the left of this clip here which means we can't add a transition to this point. Now it does give you a hint about this because if we click on this transition point here you can see the highlighted area is red or is over here it's green. So if it's red that's telling you there's not enough handles to add a transition point. So what I can do is if I grab this icon here it's the trim edit mode and I roll this clip back to give us a bit of overlap between these clips. Now if I click on this edit point you can see the right hand side is green so the right hand side does have overlap but the left hand side still doesn't which means we can put the edit point over here but not over here. If we were to just trim this one as well to give us a bit of overlap this side now that edit point is completely green and we can add our video transitions so you've just got to make sure there's that little bit of overlap. Now if we've got this edit point highlighted here and we go to any of the transitions within the effects library we right click and we add to the selected edit points and clips it's actually going to tell us exactly that. Some of the clips selected have insufficient handles to apply the transition you can either trim the clips and shorten your timeline or skip those clips entirely. So if we click on trim clips it's actually just going to do that trimming for us and then put the transition on the edit point like so. Now we've got them applied how do you adjust the length? So with this transition on our timeline to adjust the length we simply grab either the left or right hand edge and then we click and drag to adjust the length as required. Alternatively you can right click on the transition on the timeline and there's an option to change the transition duration or you can use the keyboard shortcut of control and D so then we can manually set that within here or an even easier way open up the inspector once again top right hand corner and there is a duration so we can click in either the seconds hold our mouse and we can drag left and right or we can manually enter a number in there or we can do the same thing with the frames. If you want all of the transitions to be a particular length let's say I want all of mine to be 1.5 seconds I set that duration and then I simply click set as default duration and then every time I add a new transition onto the timeline it's always going to be 1.5 seconds in length. Bosh easy now you can also copy transitions directly on the timeline really quickly and easily so I've got this transition here and I want to copy it there's a few options what we can do is give it a click so it's highlighted in red hit control and C or command and C if you're on a Mac then if we click on this edit point so the edit point is highlighted green like so then simply hit control or command and V it will copy and paste that transition you can also do this over multiple different edit points so if I copy this transition once again I'm going to click on this edit point hold control or command and then click on this one as well so that they are both highlighted then we'll control and V and it'll paste that transition across now one final way if we give the transition a click and then hold the alt key or option if you're on a Mac keeping the option key held if we click and then drag we can simply copy these transitions across now I need to just take a moment to thank this video sponsor audio audio is a music subscription service that has a highly curated selection of music and sound effects which you can use on basically any project there's the audio pro license which gives you unlimited download of all of that music and sound effects and it's available for a special price of just $59 for your first year or if it's just the music you need you can get lifetime access to all of that music for a one-off payment of just $199 both the pro and that lifetime music license gives you access to their brand new AI generated playlists an AI powered similar song search with audio vault so to get started simply head over to audio.com forward slash alex there's a link down in the description below and use the code alex70 if you want that pro license and alex199 for that awesome lifetime music license right let's transition back to the transitions now you'll notice with a lot of these transitions they don't look all that great and that's because they're linear they don't have any acceleration or deceleration in them they're just kind of a constant ne you can make all of these transitions look better by changing the easing so we've got this push transition on our timeline and if we hit play it looks a little bit boring so if we simply give it a click open up the inspector within the transition controls we have ease and by default it's set to non which is of course linear if we change this we've got in out in and out so in will mean that it's slow at the beginning and then accelerates towards the end out we'll reverse that so it'll start off fast and then slow down and then in and out will give us a nice s curve which is commonly used in animation so it will start off slow speed up in the middle and then slow down at the end giving us a generally much nicer looking animation now this is actually visualized on the timeline with this little line on the transition itself so with non it's a straight line and in and out we get this nice little s curve now that's the same for all of these standard transitions so things like the dissolves iris shapes and wipes however it's slightly different for these fusion transitions located towards the bottom many of these don't have ease controls because they have their acceleration they have that animation already baked in because they're built in fusion however some like the rotate for example does have easing but it looks slightly different so within the inspector once again we have curve we need that to be set to easing rather than linear and then we have these in and out controls so rather than just having a standard s curve you can actually change the acceleration you can change the look now the easiest thing to do with these is kind of just to play around to see which ones you like but as a general rule of thumb the ones at the top of the list are kind of mellow this will give you a relatively slow acceleration curve and the further down the list you go let's go with cirq this will be much faster and much more aggressive you've also got some fun ones to play with at the bottom like back elastic and bounce which will give you different effects so have a play with those until you find something that you're happy with if in doubt in and out can't go wrong with that but if in and out isn't quite good enough you can also set your own custom curve so you can adjust these transitions to have your version of the acceleration that you want to get them looking perfect so with these standard transitions like push once again give it a click inspector we've got the ease this time round we're going to go to in and out and then on the transition we've got this little keyframe icon if we give that a click we've got push and then if we give this s curve icon a click we can actually see that transition curve that's being applied to our push and then from here we can actually adjust it so if we click on the keyframes we can adjust this we can make the curve a little bit more aggressive if we want to we can make it so it kind of has to accelerate lows at the beginning and then fade out at the end and we can just come in and customize these curves to make the transition look however we like now in that same place in the inspector there's always a bunch of different controls which allow you to customize this transition as well now exactly what controls you'll see would depend on which transition you have open but they're generally pretty similar kind of self-explanatory but let me give you a quick few examples to show you how it all works so the slide transition is a good example on the timeline give it a click open up the inspector and we have a bunch of different controls so by default it's going to slide in from the left but we've got this preset we can change slide right left bottom up top down top left bottom right so we can just change that as required we also then get direction so we can change these just to customize the transition we've also then got border so we can add a border on this if we want if we add a bit of a border and then click feather we can have a feathered edge instead and with the border selected we can actually change the color of the border to be something out we've also got motion blur so we can just knock that right up change the in and out to in and out and then we've got a pretty different looking transition this hexagon iris even has a rotation and what you can do if you're feeling particularly fancy is keyframe it so at the beginning it's going to be minus 360 degrees i'll add a keyframe at the end of the transition i want this to be zero and now it's a rotating hexagon so you can come in customize this however you like and then once you've done all that hard work if you've changed your mind you no longer like the star wipe you want to change it to a push or a crush dissolve or a left triangle or whatever it may be you can do that really quickly using this little drop down right at the top and it's called transition type so this is a hexagon iris i've changed the easing and i've added a colored border but if i've changed my mind i can change the transition type to something like i iris instead and it's going to change it to be a completely different transition but it's going to keep the easing we set the border and the custom color so rather than having to delete it add it again and then reset it up you can simply change the transition type like so now quick note that doesn't work for the fusion transitions it only works for these standard transitions above so if i was to grab any of these fusion transitions we do get obviously the customization controls but we don't get that transition type option so we can't quickly switch between them and here's a quick ps a for you all transitions aren't just for videos you can also use these on titles to just whip a title in and out you can use them on pngs which can be a really quick handy way to get a logo to pop in or whip out or dissolve or whatever you want you can even use them on solid color which is a really nice way of creating chapter screens titles and all that sort of fun stuff and let's not forget the super useful audio transition which can help you just go from one volume to another really quickly without messing around with keyframes so i've got some music set upon my timeline and i want to just duck the audio make it quieter in one particular point what we can do is simply do a cut so i'm going to do control or command and b to do a quick cut on this second audio clip here we're just going to open up the inspector and reduce the volume and then we simply go to audio transitions and we're going to grab the cross fade 0 db and we'll put that on the edit point like so and then what's going to happen is the volume is simply going to fade down over that point now the really cool thing we're doing it that way is then you can just grab this edit point move it left and right on the timeline to get this kind of fade in the exact point you can even make the fade a little bit shorter and it's much easier than messing around with keyframes now you've messed with all of these transitions whether it's the standard ones or whether it's the fusion ones you're probably going to want to save them fortunately there's a real quick and easy way to do that as well using transition presets so i've got this triangle left setup we've put a bit of an easing on it and a border and i want to save it all you do on this timeline you right click the transition and there is an option create transition preset we're going to give this a name transition left border and then click on okay now if i just delete this from the timeline within my video transitions area if we scroll down we now have a users area and we can see triangle left border we simply give it a click drag it on add it in exactly the same way you'd usually add any of your transitions hit play and it's the same transition but it's got all of our customization saved boom easy access whenever you want them now what you can also do is set any of these transitions to be your standard transitions now this is useful because it means you can apply them with a simple keyboard shortcut without even having to open up the effects library to make any transition the standard transition that includes any user generated ones as well you simply right click it within the effects library and we set as standard transition you know it's done because you'll get this little red icon in the top left hand corner then if you right click on any edit point it will say do you want to add that standard transition and you can add it for eight frames 16 frames 32 frames or 64 so we can just give that a click and it's going to add that transition to that point you can also set a separate audio standard as you can see when i added this i've got my triangle left and my crossfade same thing in the audio transitions my crossfade is set as the default we've got our red icon we could change this if we wanted to by clicking on any of the other transitions now you can also do this via a keyboard shortcut instead so if i just delete these transitions we highlight this edit point here if i do shift and t it's just going to add the audio transition only if we do alt and t it's going to add the video transition only and if we do control and t it will add both to that edit point both my standard video transition and my standard audio transition and if you want to know how to create some of your own fancy snazzy fusion transitions from scratch stick around because i'll be making some tutorials coming up very soon thanks for watching take it easy leave your thoughts and feelings down in the comment section below i'll catch you next time
