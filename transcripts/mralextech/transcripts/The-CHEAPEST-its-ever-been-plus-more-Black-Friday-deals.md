What up folks? It's Alex here, Mr Alex Tech and we're talking about some of the Black Friday deals which might be relevant to you as DaVinci Resolve content creator kind of people. But before we get into it, a good deal is not a good deal if you don't really need it. I do it. I sit there looking at all these offers and think, oh, I don't really need that. That's a good offer. And then you end up buying things that you don't really need. Buy the things that you need if you can find them at a good price. But don't buy the things you don't need just because they're discounted. That's tips from an old man who's bought too much crap he doesn't need. Right, I'm with the video and the first one we mentioned in the title and really it's the main reason we're making this very video. DaVinci Resolve Studio is discounted. You can get it currently with 20% off. And I do genuinely think this is the first time that the standalone version of DaVinci Resolve Studio without having to buy some hardware and that sort of thing has been discounted. Directly on the Blackmagic Design website, you can see we've got this big banner, save 20%, DaVinci Resolve Studio 19 has been reduced from 295 bucks to 235 bucks, which in English money, if you're from the UK like me, including VAT, it's £222 or 185 before VAT, which is quite a significant discount. So I probably don't need to tell you all about the reasons to upgrade to DaVinci Resolve Studio. I've made videos in the past and actually I'm going to work on an updated one, but it contains loads of good stuff. There's things like the film look creator, speed warps, magic masks, you get access to more codecs and formats like Blackmagic Raw. There's loads of reasons to upgrade to DaVinci Resolve Studio and that license, even though it's discounted, it still is the standard license. So you still get a lifetime license, so it will include any future updates as well. No subscriptions, none of that. You just buy it once and job done. Now the easiest way to get it is either through some retailers. I know retailers are offering the same discount, or if you go directly to the DaVinci Resolve website, this is the one here, I've put a link down in the description below for you all, you can buy it directly from Blackmagic. So I can buy online now, it'll just load up the page. You can see the discount, you can choose your country if you're from another country, and then you just check out there and then you get a license key. You can install it on two machines and job done. That's rolling two machines. If you install it on a third, it'll wipe the previous two licenses and then you can install it on two more. So you can just keep using it forever, essentially. Nice! Now as part of this deal, they're also doing some discounts on some other DaVinci Resolve related hardware. So we have the same 20% off the DaVinci Resolve Micro Color Panel, taking it from 509 to 395. The DaVinci Resolve Micro Panel coming down from 859 to 665, and the Fairlight Desktop Console coming down from 3055 to 2445. Now I don't have a huge amount of experience with those last two, but I do have experience with the Micro Color Panel. I actually made a video talking all about it, I really like it, and I might try and snag this deal because mine was a loner from Blackmagic, it's gone back to them, but I did really enjoy using it, so I might try and pick one up while it's discounted. 395 for that Micro Color Panel is not bad at all actually. So yeah, it's worth a little look. It is also worth mentioning if you've got a favourite retailer, they might be doing some other Black Friday deals, so it is worth checking out things like the Speed Editor and the DaVinci Resolve Keyboard, because they also come with the DaVinci Resolve Studio license included. You may be able to find the Speed Editor a little bit discounted, which means that you get both the Speed Editor and the license for a reduced fee. Just make sure you check specifically with that retailer that it does include the license. It should do, but it's worth double checking before you make any purchases. Now sticking with Blackmagic, I'm a big fan of the Blackmagic Cloud, I like the convenience of it. It's super handy when you're working with other people, but it's also handy if you're a solo creator. You can back up your projects, it just means you can access them from different places without having to take an SSD with you. Obviously taking an SSD is still super handy, but it's a nice thing to have. Now the reason I'm talking about it is because it has been discounted. Now I don't believe this is a Black Friday discount, I think this is just the pricing going forward, but it's definitely worth mentioning. Why? Well, it's basically half price. It's 50% off. It's been split in twain as the old folk would say. Previously it was about 30 bucks, which would get you two terabytes of cloud storage, or the entry level was 15 bucks and that would get you 500 gig. Now, if you want 500 gig of storage, that's just seven and a half bucks. There's taxing, you've got to add tax on that. But the base price is $7.50 for 500 gig, and then the next jump used to be straight to two terabytes. Now there's a one terabyte option, which is available for 15 bucks, which was the same price the 500 gig used to be. So if you currently have a cloud license, you just have a reduced bill at the end of the month, which is quite nice. Or you can go in here, double the amount of storage if you're only on the 500 gig like I was, which is exactly what I'm going to do now, pay the same price and have twice the storage. Winner. Super nice. It's super useful. Check it out. There's a free version, so try it before you buy it. But yeah, it's a nice little thing to have. And sticking with first time ever, I'm doing a Black Friday deal on my Magic Zoom Pro and Magic Animates Pro. So these are my two little tools that are available for DaVinci Resolve. Magic Zoom is designed to allow you to really smooth, seamless punch-ins and punch out without using any keyframes. So you can just make the adjustment clip as long or as short as you need it to be. There's some silky smooth animations in there. There's motion blur. There's trackers. There's tilt shift effects and all sorts of stuff. Magic Animates is designed for just making things pop in, PNGs, logos. You can put masks on things, shadows and just change the animation of little bits and bobs that pop into your videos again without having to do the keyframes. You take a few boxes, change the animation style that you like. There's a save tool so you can save it back into your own effects library and all that sort of fun stuff. Now, don't buy those without trying the free versions first. I made free versions of both of them that are really good. You get lots of stuff in the free version. So try the free versions first, make sure it all works and only then, if you think, this is good but I want a bit more, then check out the paid version. And if you do decide to check out the paid versions, use the code blackfriday24 to get 15% off. So there's 15% off both. So you can save a couple of pennies, which is always nice. And I'll be running that just check the date up until the 6th of December. So there's a week from today to use that code to get your 15% off Magic Zoom Pro and Magic Animate Pro. So links in the description, go check those out. Next up, we've got two friends of the channel, MotionVFX, who are currently running 30% off all of their plugins for DaVinci Resolve. So any of the titles and stuff that you see in my videos generally is available from MotionVFX. As you can see, DaVinci Resolve packs 30% off with the code BW30. So you have to use BW30 at checkout, but it's all over the website, so it's nice and obvious. And this offer ends in five days, 15 hours, 55 minutes and five seconds as of right now. But that's counting down, obviously. All of the fancy titles you see in this video and lots of my other videos. And in my Mac Mini video that I did recently, I had lots of graphs and infographic-y stuff. All of that is available from MotionVFX. Winner! And the other friend of the channel is, of course, audio. Now, audio aren't running any kind of specific Black Friday deals, but if you want to get a year's worth of that Audio Pro license, which gets you all of that music and sound effects, you can get the first year for just 59 bucks. There's a link down in the description below for that one. Or if it's just music you need, then you can get all of that music forever. It's a lifetime music license for a one-off payment of 199 bucks. So there you go. Of course, there are other deals out there to be had. I've actually just put a new mouse in my basket on Amazon, because everyone's always telling me how good these Logitech, Master, MX, Mice are, Mouses. And I need a new one, because I've had this one for years and it's getting a little bit ropey. So we're going to pick one of those up. This time of year is always pretty good to get kind of accessories. I always pick up SD cards around this time of year, because SD cards do get quite cheap. I use these Lexar Professionals 128 gig, that are on Amazon at the moment for about 25 quid, which is not bad. This thing is reduced. This is by PGY Tech. This is my card holder. The reason I like this thing is you can fit all your cards in it. It's nice and robust. Also, has a Type-T cable in it, and it's also the reader. So when you go away, you can take four SD cards, a bunch of micro SD cards and whatever else, and it's your card reader, all in one. Plus, you can play with it. And it's quite satisfying. So I like that. External SSDs, they're usually cheap. Internal NVMe SSDs, like the ones I talked about in my Mac video recently. They're usually on offer as well. Plus other things like bags and lights and microphones and all that sort of good stuff. But remember, as I said at the beginning, trying not to get trapped into too much and only buy the things that you need. So on that note, I hope you found this video useful. Take it easy. Happy holidays. Happy weekends, whatever. Whatever you're doing. Take it easy. I'll see you next time.
