Music We made it, we're in Eugene in Oregon for his old car. Yesterday was a ridiculously long day, but we're here. So, yeah, we had a good kit, staying at this random hotel for tonight, and then we're actually moving in a moment to the main holiday inn hotel where ResolveCon is, we're doing that in a minute, but we're up now, going to get some breakfast, and off we go. Music Right, we've done our one night at the best western, an hour after the holiday inn, which is literally next door, but check out, it was at 12, we've got the massive bags, and I don't think we can get in until 3? Three or four. Three or four. So we've got a few hours to kill, hopefully we can drop our bags off. I look good. Woo! I would not have been surprised if you'd stuck me. Music Right, we're in. Big thanks to Holiday Inn Express, because they allowed us to check in early, so we're not hanging around for like three hours doing nothing. We're super bagged, we're in the hotel, we're here at ResolveCon, ready to go. Now we just need to finish, so we can have a presentation, but I'm not until Sunday, but all day today to go through it. I have done it, I just need to tidy it up, make sure it all fits the time frame, cut some bits out, that sort of stuff. So then once that's done, ready for ResolveCon. Music Huge system, toast. Music Who's in here? Casey. Hello. Hello. Must finally meet you. How you doing? Good, good. Hi. This is Becky. Hi, good to meet you. Music This is it, ResolveCon. Has begun. Music Music Music Music We be glow. Music Alex, hold on, wait, I gotta do the YouTuber show. I gotta do the YouTuber thing. Wooo. Music We've come out to get some dinner. It's like a who's who of DaVinci Resolve YouTubers. Music Hello. Music Music Education is important. Editing is important. Couldn't agree more. This was actually a package that was already here at the Holiday Inn for me, which I was quite surprised about, but it came with a letter. It's from Fred Dudney. So thank you very much indeed, Fred. He says one of his retirement hobbies has been DaVinci Resolve. Thanks to my good self, Casey and Billy and others for helping him to get stuck in. So thank you very much. I really appreciate that as a nice little gift to arrive to. Yeah, that's great. You've been to the ground. Yeah. And seems to fit all right as well. You like it? Thanks, Fred. Music So, yeah, you've had some really informative professional information. It's a little bit different with me. We're just going to have some fun on the edit page. Cinematic envy. Something like that. Because I'm that creative, I couldn't even think of a good name for a movie. There you go. Who here has heard of my magic animate tool? Oh, yes. Cool. Thanks very much. We can add pulses. We can add shakes. We can add wobbles, waves. You might not want to do that on anything. It's nightmare fuel, that, isn't it? Cheese. Have a rage quit. Go put the TV on, whatever. Everyone have a good breakfast? One happy? More will you like? Cool. Remove the barriers and you'll just get more done. Applause That's it. It's all a go. Laughter Nah. So, just finished my presentation at ResolveCon 2022. And we're all done. And it all went well. You were very good. Yeah. So, thank you. Lots of nice comments. Hopefully you all enjoyed it. If you're watching the live stream, it did seem to go well. A few hiccups here and there, but nothing too major. So, yeah. Treating myself now with a monster. Because I'm an adult and that's what we do. We've got Darren and Cullard on next. Doing colour. So, let's go have a look. Music That's it. My stuff is done at ResolveCon. There's another session going on now, but it's nearly finished. One, my presentation seemed to go down really well. People seemed to enjoy it. The online comments were really good. So, if you're watching online, thank you very much for any kind words. And, well, just for tuning in really. And if you were here in person once again, thank you very much. It was really awesome to meet you all. So, yeah, it's done. I was a little bit nervous this morning. Ran through it quite a few times to make sure it was all good, but it all seemed to go okay. So, happy days. Indeed.
