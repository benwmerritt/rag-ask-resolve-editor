What up, folks? Alex here, Mr. Alex Tech, and I've got a two-ish Minute Tuesday video for you today because I'm going to show you the latest way to do the video in-text effect in DaVinci Resolve 17. It's dead quick, it's dead easy, so let's open DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you how to do it. So here we are, in DaVinci Resolve, we're on the edit tab and I've got this footage set up on my timeline ready to go. Now the first thing you want to do is just to move your video footage up in the timeline. So you need to create space for a text underneath. So I'm just going to move my video track up like so, leaving this video track one free where I can add my text effect. And then we're just going to add a text. So we're going to open up the effects library, come down to the toolbox, titles, grab text, and then just put it underneath there like so. Now it doesn't actually matter which video track you're on, it's just important that the video is above the text like so. Then we're going to give the video a click, open up the inspector, top right-hand corner, click on the video tab, come down until you see composite, give it a click if you don't see the options underneath, and then change the composite mode from normal to foreground. Then click on the text underneath, go to the same place, so the inspector, video, make sure you're on the settings tab, and then come down to composite once again. And this time we're just going to change that one to alpha. Da-da! Now we've got our text with our video underneath. So we can give the text a click, go back to the title tab this time, we can increase the size, change our font, relocate it, do whatever we want with it. It's all there, good to go, and if we hit play, the video will play underneath like so. Now what's really cool about this, grab both of those, and we're going to move them up one more track, so we've got this empty track underneath, and then you can put whatever you want under here as well. So if I was to just go to generators, and then I'm going to grab a solid color, we'll put that underneath, we'll give that a click, open up the inspector, generator, color, we'll make this red, and now we've got a red background with our text with our video playing underneath. And last but not least, let's delete this solid color, and instead grab a video file, and we'll put the video file underneath this time instead. So now we've got our title playing this top clip with this bottom clip as the background. So we've got video within text, within video. Da-da! Easy peasy. And that's it for this video. I hope you liked it. If you did, give me a thumbs up, any comments or feedback, put them down in the comment section below, and if you're new here, don't forget to hit that subscribe button for me.
