What up folks, it's Alex here. Welcome to MrAlexTech and in this video I'm going to show you how to create and restore project archive files within DaVinci Resolve. Now project archive files are really, really cool because they allow you to pack up a project and all of the media files within into one file, which you can then move to an external hard drive for storage or put on a memory card so you can transfer it over to another machine so you can keep editing from there. Now what's also really cool about this is it will work across platform so you can start a project on Windows, pack it all up, move it over to a Mac, restore and then keep working from there. So without further ado, let's open up DaVinci Resolve and take a look. So here we are within DaVinci Resolve and I've currently got the project manager open. This is the first screen that you see as soon as you open up DaVinci Resolve and it's from here that we can export our project archive. Now don't worry, if you've already opened your project within DaVinci Resolve, all you need to do is click on the little house icon in the bottom right hand corner to open up your project manager and then from here you can export the archive. And then to do so, all you need to do is find the project that you want to export, simply right click and then come down to export project archive. A standard Explorer window will appear like this and then all you need to do is to find the location that you wish to export the archive to. Now this can be an internal drive, it can be a memory card or a memory stick or an external hard drive. I'm going to go with my external hard drive for this demonstration. So I'm going to open up this Samsung T5 and we're just going to export it to here. Give it a name, I'm going to leave the file name as it is and put it in a folder if you want to, I'm just going to leave it there for now. We're going to click save and then this little archive window will appear. Now this is quite important, there's three tick boxes. You've got the media files, the proxy media and the render cache. So you need to tick what you want to be included within the archive itself. So obviously by default it's going to export the project, but do you also want to include the media files, i.e. any photos, videos or music which you've added to the project itself, the proxy media and the render cache. Now generally my recommendation, turn off the render cache and just include the media files. The render cache can get really big really quickly and it can make this project archive way bigger than it really needs to be. So I just tick the media files tick box. Once you're happy, click on OK. And then it will begin copying the media files and the project to that location that you've specified. Give it a minute or two to complete that and then you're ready to move over to the new system. Now that you've moved to other devices, it's really important to note that if you just restore the project while it's still contained on that memory stick or external hard drive, DaVinci Resolve will always look for the media files at that location. Now that's fine if you want to work off that external SSD. However, if you were to then unplug the device, the files would show as media offline within DaVinci Resolve. So generally what I tend to do is to make a copy of the project archive, move it onto the desktop or the internal drive of the PC or whatever you're editing on and then restore it from there. Now I've moved over to my other device which happens to be a Mac and we want to restore the project archive. So I've got it on this Samsung drive here. So we're going to open it up. You can see the DRA file here. If we was just double click that, you can see it's got the project and it's also got our media files. Now as mentioned, it's really important that you set this to the location that you want it to remain forever if it's going to stay on this PC or whatever you want to do. I don't want it running off my Samsung drive. So I'm just going to click on the DRA file. I'm going to copy that and I'm going to move it just to my desktop because I'm going to have it stored on there. Once that's done, we can restore the project archive. So I'm going to open up DaVinci Resolve until I get to the product manager as you can see here. We're going to right click on an empty space. So not on the thumbnail itself, just anywhere in between. And then we're going to go to restore project archive. Then we just need to browse the location. So in my case, it is the desktop and we've got this splitty dot DRA. Now it's really important that you don't need to open that folder and then click on the project. You're actually opening the DRA folder itself. So we're just going to give that a click and then we're going to click on open. And then the project will be added to your project manager. So you can see here it says splitty to. If we then double click that to open it up, you can see we've got our project, we've got our timeline and all of the media has also been imported and relinked to that new location. So from here, you're good to go. And that's it. It's a really important thing to note, especially if you want to back up any projects or move them between devices. Hopefully you found it useful.
