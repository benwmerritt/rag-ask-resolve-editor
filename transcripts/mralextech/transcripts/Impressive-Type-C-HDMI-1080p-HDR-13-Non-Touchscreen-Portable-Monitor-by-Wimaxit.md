What up folks, it's Alex here. Now if you've watched any of my videos before, you'll know that I always use two screens. Having more than one screen will make you more productive and just generally make your life a little bit easier. A company called We Maxit, or Wim Maxit, Wim Maxit, Wim Maxit, I'm gonna go with Wim Maxit, reached out and asked if I wanted to have a little look at one of our new 13.3 inch 1080p IPS HDR portable monitors. And here it is. So this is a real quick video review of this, the Wim Maxit 13.3 inch portable monitor. Let's grab the box and I'll show you what's inside. So here's the packaging, relatively plain and simple, but it does the job. Pop that open and you'll find the device itself. As you can see, it comes with this folio style case included. On top of that, you also get a screen protector, which I've chosen not to use personally. Type C to type C cable. There's also a type A to type C USB cable, which is primarily for powering the device. You also get a full size HDMI 2.0 cable. On top of that, there's also a USB wall plug, a cleaning cloth, and an instruction manual. So with that out of the way, let's have a real quick look at the device. It's about the same size as an A4 piece of paper, as it's 20 centimeters by 30 centimeters. It's one centimeter thick and weighs just over a kilo. The device is roughly the same size, give or take, as a Surface Pro. Now, as you can see, I've got the case included. It's a rubber material. It's quite thick. It does a good job of protecting the device. If you want to remove it, you can do so using these two screws on the back, which can be removed by hand, so you don't need a screwdriver with you. The case folds out to form a stand. Now, there's no magnets in the case. It's all just done on friction, so it can slip aside a little bit. There's also no magnets keeping it closed, so it may come open in your bag, but I've not had any issues with it as of yet. You have a micro USB port, which is primarily there just for powering the device. You've got two USB type-C ports. One is purely for power. The other one is for power and input. And as I say, you've also got that full-size HDMI port. That's on the left side of the device. On the right, you'll find a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, the power button, and then also a little scroll wheel for navigating through the UI. On the left and right sides of the monitor are stereo speakers, and on the back, you will also find a 75 by 75 Vesa mount if you wanted to mount this device. Now, for me personally, it's quite important not to understate the usefulness of that full-size HDMI port. It means you connect it to games, consoles, older devices, older laptops, as well as my Surface Pro, which doesn't have a USB type-C port on it. Now, the glass is also thick. It's much more like the glass you'd find on a smartphone rather than that of a monitor, which is quite reassuring because this thing will be carry-around with you. It's quite thick, it feels quite strong, so hopefully you shouldn't have any issues with that. Now, the downside to having glass like that on this sort of device is, as you can see, it's glossy, so it's very, very reflective, and it is also a bit of a fingerprint magnet. Now, onto the display quality itself, and it's actually really very good. At 13.3 inches, the 1080p resolution provides a nice, crisp, sharp image. Brightness is okay, it's not the best, but it's decent enough for most situations. I've been using it in my office at home as well as at work, and it's perfectly acceptable there, so you shouldn't have too many issues. You will struggle outside in direct light, however, especially with that glossy display. Now, colors are really quite nice. They're vibrant, they're punchy, and they have plenty of saturation. Contrast is also good with deep, rich blacks. Now, I don't actually have anything to test the brightness or the colors, so here it is, stacked up against my Surface Pro 2017, which in general regard is having really good levels of brightness and color accuracy, so you can see how it compares. Now, they're currently both set to full brightness, and as you can see, the Surface Pro is a lot brighter, a hell of a lot brighter. You actually have to knock the Surface Pro down to about 50% brightness until they're about equal. But in terms of colors and contrast, there's not that much in it. They both seem really not too bad at all. Now, as another quick demonstration, here it is up against my work laptop, which is a Dell Inspiron 5590. This is a 1080p screen. Now, in this shot, it's also set to full brightness, and the colors look about right. If anything, I actually think the Wiimax, it looks a little bit nicer. There's more saturation, the colors pop a little bit more, and in terms of brightness, there's not really much separating them. Now, if you currently edit videos using DaVinci Resolve, for example, using a laptop, then a portable monitor like this may actually come in really handy. It simply allows you to move things like the media pull over to another screen, giving you much more room for your timeline or your preview window. If you currently use your laptop for your color grading, I recommend you keep using that display for your color grading, and again, just make use of this additional display to move some things across, and don't use it for the actual color grade itself. Now, this is a HDR monitor, so if you connect a HDR device, such as a PS4, PC, or whatever it may be, you will reap the benefits of a high dynamic range. The colors look really, really good. They look better, obviously, than just using a standard input. I've tested this on both my PC and my PS4. They instantly recognized that it was HDR compatible, and it was easy enough to turn on. Now, the downside with the HDR is if you're using it on a PC, I use it on Windows, for example. The HDR content itself, such as videos and games, looks really, really good, but the rest of the standard dynamic range content, such as just being Windows or Word or Microsoft Office, whatever it may be, can start to look a little bit flat in comparison. Now, the refresh rate of the monitor is 60 hertz, which is pretty standard for this sort of thing. Now, I can't find any information about the response time of this monitor, but I have used it to play some games on both my PC and my PS4, and it felt good, it felt responsive, it didn't feel choppy, or like there's a delay of any type. Now, as mentioned, I've connected this device to loads of different inputs, such as the PS4, my full Windows 10 PC, Linux-based mini PC, as well as a Samsung phone, all of which picked the device up straight away, and I've had no connectivity issues whatsoever. If you're using Type-C on a laptop, for example, the Type-C cable will be able to provide enough power and the audio and video output, so you'll only need one cable. I used the Type-C using a Samsung Galaxy S10 to get into the decks. Now, that worked straight away, however, every now and again, the screen would cut off, and I think that was a power delivery issue. Once I inserted a second cable into a wall adapter, just to provide some more power, it was perfectly fine. Using the HDMI user input, that doesn't deliver any power, so then you will also need to plug in a second cable to power the device. This actually makes a really nice little gaming monitor for on the go, and I say that because you can plug the HDMI into this device from the PS4, and then use one of the PS4 USB ports to actually power the device. So you don't need to plug it into a wall. You've got one plug socket powering your PS4 and the monitor, and you're good to go. Now, the menu system on this device is accessed by pushing in the scroll wheel. It's a relatively standard affair. You can adjust things like contrast and saturation, brightness, and that sort of thing. Nothing too complicated there. The only one nice touch that I will mention is if you hold that scroll wheel down, there's a selection of crosshair overlays which you can activate, which may be useful for any of you PC gamers out there. Now, last but not least, as I mentioned, this does have stereo speakers, but they're not really very good at all. They'll do the job in a pinch, but if audio is important to you, I definitely recommend using the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack instead. That's it, that's a real quick overview. So far, I'm really impressed with it. Yes, there are thinner, lighter versions out there with touchscreen, for example, but none of those things really mattered to me. That much, I'd much rather have the decent selection of ports and the HDR image quality. And it's small and light enough to take anywhere whether you can just chuck it in a laptop bag and off you go. If you're a laptop user looking for a secondary display or someone looking for a primary display to use with a games console or that sort of thing, this is actually a surprisingly solid option.
