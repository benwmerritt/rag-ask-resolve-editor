Has this ever happened to you? You've just finished an awesome project in DaVinci Resolve. It's full of fusion effects, transitions, titles, color grades, noise reduction, and you just want to watch it back before you export it to make sure your narrative is... Mmm... perfect. But you can't, because it's jam-packed full of those awesome effects, you can't get the smooth playback. And all you want to do is watch it from start to finish without all that additional seasoning to make sure that it flows. Well actually, you can. There's a sneaky little button that's hiding on the edit page which allows you to do just that. This is the bypass color grades and fusion effects button and it hides just above your preview window on the edit page. By default it's turned off which basically means that our color grades and our fusion effects are turned on. So if I hit play you can see I've got all my transitions, text, animations going on and I'm getting slightly stuttery playback. If we simply give it a click that icon will go gray and we'll get the little red line through it. Now if I hit play again I'm getting perfect 30 frames per second and none of my titles, animations or color grades are coming through. But there's more. There's actually a keyboard shortcut. Rather than having to hit this icon every time, simply use the shift and D keyboard shortcut to enable the bypass on and off. It's a really handy way of just toggling it as you need it. How handy is that? And there's actually one more thing that you can do with it. You can toggle whether you want the color grades and or the fusion effects to be disabled allowing you to check exactly what you want. Let's say that you want to check your titles but you want to disable that noise reduction because we all know noise reduction really chugs up your system. We can do that too. On the edit page once again, go to your icon and then simply right click and then you get the option to toggle between color and fusion. So at the moment I've got both ticked which means both things will be bypassed. If we tick fusion the icon will look like this and that just means that we'll be bypassing color. So color is the only thing that's got a tick next to it. If we tick fusion and untick color then we get these three little stars and that simply means that any fusion effects will be bypassed but all of my color grades will still be coming through. Simple. Now mine also has a bypassed Mr. Alex Tech button so I'm going to give that a click.
