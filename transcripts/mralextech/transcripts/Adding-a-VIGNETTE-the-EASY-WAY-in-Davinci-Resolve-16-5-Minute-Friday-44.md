What up folks, it's Alex here and welcome to Five Minute Friday. Now in this video We're going to talk about vignettes. Now if you don't know what vignettes are It's that sort of darkening you see around the edges of the frame Sometimes it occurs naturally within your lens and other times it's something you may want to add Afterwards in post purely for aesthetic reasons. I for one love a good vignette. I use it all the time in the studio It really makes me pop and I also use it within my photography quite a lot as well But before we actually boot open to which resolve and get into it I just want to take a moment to thank the sponsors of this video Nvidia and scan computers Do you want the best from your creative applications and hardware? Well Nvidia studio is a platform designed for creatives that incorporates that RTX GPUs with specialized SDKs Combined with dedicated Nvidia studio drivers You get ultimate performance and stability for your workflow and creative needs the platform includes Specific laptops and desktops that have been carefully selected and put through laboratory based performance and compatibility tests to ensure the best Creative application experience for you covering everything from Adobe to Maya the venture resolve blender and more only the ones that pass Get the RTX studio badge So with an Nvidia studio RTX laptop you can take your creativity Anywhere packing all the performance and reliability of a desktop into a portable solution and for a limited time only you can get Three months of Adobe creative cloud free with select Nvidia studio purchases now We've actually got one of the latest and greatest Nvidia RTX studio laptops right here This is a gigabyte aero 15 and it's sporting it Nvidia RTX 2018 Max-Q so if you want to see more information about this particular laptop Or you just want to have a browse of some of the other Nvidia RTX range check out the link in the description below to see Scans range of Nvidia RTX studio hardware and make sure you stay tuned to the channel because the video coming very shortly Well, we put these new creative application Optimizations to the test we're going to push this thing really hard in DaVinci resolve and see how it holds up So with that out of the way, let's open resolve and have a look at some vignettes. Shall we? So here we are folks. We're in DaVinci resolve. I've set up my timeline and we're ready to go Now whenever I apply any sort of effect and you always do it using an adjustment clip Just because it makes life a little bit easier and that's no different today. So we're going to open up the effects library I'm going to open up the toolbox. We're going to go to effects I'm going to grab an adjustment clip and going to put it on a timeline above our footage Now I'm just going to lengthen this so it covers both of our clips Like so now with the effects library still open. We're going to click on open effects We're going to scroll right down until you see the resolve effects stylized category We're going to grab vignette and we're just going to apply that to our adjustment clip And all of vignette is is a darkening of the edges of your footage essentially So as you can see, we've got this all over in the middle and we've got our dark corners Now that is obviously a little bit strong. So we just want to change the attributes of the vignette So give the adjustment clip a click in the top right hand corner open your inspector And then the top two tabs you should see video and open effects click on open effects And then you should see vignette if it's minimized just double click on the word vignette to open it up The first thing you've got here is the operating mode. There's two basic and advanced Self-explanatory really will stick in basic for now and then you've got the shape. So you've got size Really simple how big or how small do you want this vignette to be and then you've got anamorphism Which is essentially the shape. So if we drag it to the left It goes a little bit more vertical and we go to the right. It goes more anamorphic and it goes more horizontal So if we drag that I like to drag that right up to the right hand side And then we're just going to reduce the size a little bit like so Something like that So under appearance we've got softness We can drag that to the left to make it a little bit harsher and sharper and drag it to the right to actually soften it up a little bit And then what's really interesting underneath that you can actually change the color Which actually allows for some really interesting effects. So I'm going to give the color box a click And we've got a color picker here So if you want to add a little bit of blue Let's just select the blue And then we can just increase that saturation from the right hand side like this. Let's move that out of the way And as you can see it's added this sort of pale Cornering to which I quite like it looks quite good and you can reduce the saturation So by bringing that down to black or you can increase it to the top like so Let's go for something about there and we'll click on okay Now if that's still too strong for you you can change the blend So we can increase the blend which actually reduces the overall effect until you've got a middle point that you're happy with If you want more control Select the operating mode go down to advanced And then you've got some extra options here So you can change the shape from oval triangle diamond rectangle hexagon or octagon You can also change the center point. So you've got the x and y here. So you can just move it to the left to the right Up and down And if we scroll down here, you've got two extra options in appearance You've got the transparency so you can just increase that transparency And then you've also got different composite modes. So it's set to multiply by default, but you can have some fun changing to hard light Maybe something like luminosity and it'll just change how the two layers affect each other Now a really good use for this is outside in the sun with Drone footage like this for example, but it also works really really well With your internal studio style footage because you can just help darken the background a little bit and to make you pop out So I nearly always apply a vignette or reset this move our playhead over here like so That's a little bit harsh for me, but all i'm going to do is increase that Increase that a little bit and there you go You go from that with the nice little darkening making me pop out And that's as it was before And that is the vignette with indivisible So that's it folks. I hope that was useful if it was give me a thumbs up If you've got any comments or feedback drop them down below and if you're new around here Don't forget to subscribe I'd really appreciate it if you did click on the link down below to have a look at some of these new nvidia laptops Thank you for watching. As always, I shall see you next time Bye
