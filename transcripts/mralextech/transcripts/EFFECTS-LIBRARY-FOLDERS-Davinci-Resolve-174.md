What up, folks? Alex here. DaVinci Resolve 17.4 is out, as I'm sure you're probably already aware. One of the big new features, at least for me, are these folders within the Effects Library on the edit page. We now have folders, so we can stay organized. How awesome is that? Now, quick caveat, a quick warning. This isn't really designed for everyone to use. This is really designed for those people that create their own macros and then save them within the Effects Library. So if you're creating your own titles and doing stuff in Fusion and saving them, this is an absolute winner for you. Either way, stick around. It's useful to know, so I'm going to show you how it works. Now, fortunately, it's dead easy. It's dead quick. It works exactly the same on Windows and Mac. I've tested both. I'm going to demonstrate it on Windows because it's a little bit easier for my setup, but yeah, it works both the same. Sorry, Linux people. I don't know. If someone can test it for me, let me know down in the comments below. That would be awesome. So with all that waffle out the way, let's open DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you what to what. So here we are in DaVinci Resolve. And as you can see, I've got my Effects Library open on the left. And if I expand Effects, you can see I've got Mistralix Tech, Motion VFX, expand Motion VFX. We've got M Channel Clean and MTuber 2 within there. Quick one, Motion VFX creates these transitions and effects packs for DaVinci Resolve. They've sent me these to test out. I'm going to be doing a review over the weekend of that. So stick around. If you're interested, fortunately, I think they just guessed they made the folder structure ahead of time. So now that Resolve have introduced this feature, all of that has worked perfectly and are in nice tidy folders. So fair play to Motion VFX for basically predicting the future on that one. So how do you do it? Well, first things first, the easiest way, hop into the Fusion tab, open up the Effects Library, which has now been changed to just be Effects, by the way. Used to be called Effects Library, now it's just Effects. So I'll have to remember that. We're going to expand templates. And this works for Fusion, but the main thing we want is this Edit tab, because we want these folders on the Edit tab. So if we click on the word Edit, and then over here, you've got these three little dots, give that a click and then show folder. And then this will appear. So this is your directory. This is my edit folder within the template. And I've got Effects, Generators, Titles and Transitions. In Resolve, if I just expand Edit, you can see we've got the same folders there, Effects, Generators, Titles and Transitions. So all we're doing is creating the folder structure we want within this folder on the OS itself. And that will be reflected within the Vinture Resolve. So I'm going to use Effects. If I expand Edit, go to Effects, we've got Motion VFX at the moment, but we don't have anything else. So in this folder here, we're going to open Effects, we don't have a Motion VFX folder within here because it's a DRFX file. I'll come back to that shortly. So all I'm going to do right click, I'm going to go to New, I'm going to go Folder, and I'm going to go Mr. Alex Tech. Now in Resolve, if I open Effects, you'll notice I don't yet have the Mr. Alex Tech folder within there. After you've made the folder, it still won't appear in the Vinture Resolve unless you put a dot settings file within it or something within it. So it knows there's a folder there, but it won't display it because it's empty. So you just need to put something in it and then it will appear. So I'm going to grab these because I've got a PNG and a settings. So they've got the little thumbnails attached. And we're just going to drop them into the Mr. Alex Tech folder. Give it a second. I don't need to come out of Resolve and back in if I just expand Effects now. Now we've got a Mr. Alex Tech folder, and I've got my Magic Animate and my Magic Zoom. And then most importantly, I'm going to click on Edit to jump back into the Edit tab. We're going to go to the Effects Library toolbox, Effects. And now we have that Mr. Alex Tech folder within there with the effects that we dropped in place. Now if I wanted subfolders within that Mr. Alex Tech folder, we'll open it up, we'll click New, and we'll just do Test for now. We're going to pop these ones in there. Now we've got an extra drop down, Test, which has the Magic Animate, or I can just click on Mr. Alex Tech, which has got both. So it really is as easy as that. Now I've tested a few additional things. You can't create any additional folders at the source level. So I can't, well I can, I could make a folder here called Mr. Alex Tech. And then if I grabbed a settings file and drop that in there, it would appear within here. So I can say I've got Effects Generators, Mr. Alex Tech titles and transitions within the Fusion page. But if I go back to the Edit page, if we go to the Toolbox, you can see we've only got transitions, titles, generators, and effects. We don't have that additional Mr. Alex Tech folder. We do, however, if I open effects, have the Mr. Alex Tech folder within there. And within there, we've got a Test folder. So you can create these folders within the existing structure, sticking to those four source folders. You just can't make any at that sort of top level, which is understandable at the minute, but I bet they'll introduce that a little bit later on further down the line. Now I'm going to go back one level to this Templates folder. And you can see here, this is where all the DRFX folders or files, whatever you want to call them, are installed to. So if we take this one, for example, this mTuber2, this is one single DRFX file, but the mTuber2 pack contains transitions, effects, and a few other things. So if we go to Template, Edit, Effects, you can see I've got Motion VFX within there, Titles, Motion VFX within there, Transitions, Motion VFX within there. So all you need to do is to make sure to include the file structure within the DRFX file when you create it. And that will work as soon as someone installs it. If you want to know more about the DRFX files, I made a video when I was first released, that's linked up above, you can go and check that out. But I'll show you really quickly how to create them on here as well. So I like to do this in a separate folder, or as things can get really confusing. And so I've got a new folder here. So then all I need to do is match this structure, starting with Edit. So I'm going to have a folder called Edit, we're going to open that up. We're going to have a new folder. Let's open this. We'll have one simply called Effects. And we'll have another one called Titles. And then let's open Effects, and we're going to do New, Mr. Alex Tech. And Titles, New, Mr. Alex Tech. And we're just going to draw any two files within there. And we'll go to Effects, Mr. Alex Tech. We'll drop this lens flare in there, like so. So we've got this file structure now within this other file structure. I'm going to go back to Edit, right click. If you're on Windows, don't use the standard compressed zip folder. Apparently that can cause some issues. I use seven zip personnel. It's just much, much easier. So I'm just going to go to Add to Edit.zip. And that's going to zip that up. I then just need to click on this, make sure that I've got the file name included in the name so I can change this to a DRFX. Again, I expand on that more in my proper video, check that out. If this bit is a little bit confusing, we're going to click on Yes. And now you can see it's a DRFX file. So I'm going to copy that. Just drop it here into this template area. So we've now got this edit dot DRFX. If you're paying attention, you just saw that refresh over there. So now if we go to Effects, Mr. Alex Tech, we've now got the lens flare within there, which wasn't there previously. And there you go. That's awesome. So people can just install these DRFX files and it will keep your structure. Now there's one last really cool thing which I just want to show you in my edit DRFX that I just created, I created a folder called Effects, and then a folder called Mr. Alex Tech. Now already within my edit and effects, I've got a folder called Mr. Alex Tech, which has got this other stuff within it. Now because it identified that that folder heading was the same, it's dropped my magic zoom and the lens flare within the same Mr. Alex Tech. So what that means is if you keep your file structures the same within DRFX files, so if I release a transitions pack, and it's transitions Mr. Alex Tech and then an additional folder with all the transitions in my next one that I do six months down the line, if I follow the same structure, transitions Mr. Alex Tech, new transitions with the transitions within there, it will put them all within that Mr. Alex Tech folder because it'll see that they're the same, and even though they're separate DRFX files, it will keep that main folder, that header of Mr. Alex Tech the same, which again just means there's less duplication and less messy effects library stuff going on for people that download them and use it. So there you go, it's really really awesome. Now what if someone sent you a DRFX file, maybe it's one of my older ones, which doesn't have the folders currently set up, or it does, but you don't really like the format, you can go in and tweak them even if they've sent you a DRFX file, because they are just zip files with a different name, you can actually turn the back into a zip file, unzip them, and then put them in the folders that you want to. So let me show you that real quick. What I'm going to do is right click, I'm going to go to rename, I'm going to change the DRFX to ZIP zip, I said Z then like an American, if you change a file name extension might become unusable. Yes, that's fine. It becomes a standard zip file. I can then right click, extract all, click on extract. I'm going to delete the zip file, now I don't need it. And now I've got this folder here, ultimate seamless transitions, edit transitions, Mr. Alex Tech, ultimate, and it's got them in there. Obviously I've already done it, but then we've got the zip files. So we could just cut those. Let's go back to template, I then go to edit transitions. Let's say I wanted these here under a different name. Hello. Pop them in there, paste, and then job done. So if the DRFX file isn't your liking, change it to zip, extract it, put the settings files wherever you want them, job done. And that's pretty much it in a nutshell. That's the general gist of it. Have a play with them. If you create your own effects and you do all that sort of macro stuff, let me know how you get on with them down in the comment section below. If you did enjoy this, if you want to know any more, if you think of me or something, let me know that as well. Thanks for watching. Enjoy Adventure Resolve 17.4. I've been enjoying it already. Third video in like 24 hours. I've got another one to do in a bit as well. So there you go. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. See you.
