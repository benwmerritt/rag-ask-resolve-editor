How you all doing? I hope you had a really great Christmas and New Year break. Now I wanted to make a real quick channel update video. As you can tell I've got a stinking horrible cold again, I'm all bundled up. So I sound like crap so I apologise for that. So first things first, number one, thank you. Really want to give out my sincere thanks to each and every one of you that is a subscriber to the channel. If you've watched any videos, any sort of input that you've put on the channel for this year, real sincere thank you very much. Huge thank you to all the lads and lassies that subscribed this time last year when I just hit a thousand subs. Really helped the channel grow. You've liked, you've watched, you've subscribed, you've commented below, you've engaged with me and I think that's amazing so thank you very much for that. And then all of the new subscribers, a lot of which have arrived recently. Big thank you to you as well for turning up for subscribing, for enjoying the content. We actually managed to get 1.6 thousand subscribers in December alone. That's a new high, awesome way to end the year so thank you very much for that. Hopefully we can keep that momentum going into 2020. As of right now, as of right now we've got 14,444 subscribers to Mr. Alex Tech, which is way more than I ever expected to get by this time so amazing. Thank you all very, very much indeed. Point number two, this is not purely a DaVinci Resolve channel. Now I know I've not done myself any favours with this. I said the same thing last year and then pretty much made a year's worth of DaVinci Resolve videos. DaVinci Resolve is one of the things I focus on. I really like doing these tutorials. I like feeling like I'm giving you something and you're learning from it and then everyone can become better and I think that's really, really cool. But from my perspective, I don't want to fall into that whole of just doing DaVinci Resolve stuff. So this channel is not called DaVinci Resolve this or whatever and that's because it's not just the DaVinci Resolve channel. It's Mr. Alex Tech. It's me talking about the things I like, maybe vlogging, talking about general technology and all that sort of thing. And this year I really want to push that. I'm still going to do DaVinci Resolve videos. Don't think I'm going to knock that on the head because I'm not. But I do want to sort of branch out a little bit, do extra things here and there. So I'm really looking forward to actually getting stuck in. I recently just bought a new, I'm going to pick this up today. This is a Peak Design bag. Not cheap, really expensive, but it's a really cool bag. It means I can take my camera with me sort of every day, have it on me, this really nice little package and hopefully start just doing more off the cuff fun vlog style videos. I'm going to keep this channel as varied and as fun and as exciting as it can be as well as doing this tutorial stuff. So I just wanted to let you all know about that basically. I can't think. What am I talking about next? Number three, brands and stuff. Number three, brands and monetization. In December, things went a bit crazy. I started to get emails from really well-known, quite big companies. DaVinci Blackmagic got in touch, for example, just started having a chat with me saying they liked the videos. Would I like to have a look at that keyboard? Which I have here, which I'm going to make it with. This is probably going to be my next video because I've had it for a couple of weeks now. I've been playing with it, experimenting, sort of trying to get to grips with it and see, sort of really just to see the point of it. What's the point in this thing? I now do see the point. It's a lovely bit of kit. Really is. But it's super, super niche. So it's really nice, but it's niche. I'll elaborate more in a video to come. And there's some other companies that I've got in touch with me, talking about doing some sort of collaboration brandy sort of stuff. And that's really exciting for me. And as I get to play with things and do cool stuff. So that should hopefully be coming this year. Don't worry, I'm not going to sell out and start selling you all down the river. Is that saying selling you all down? I think it is. But yeah, if I can do some more brand deals and get to play with cool stuff, I can, I can make these videos only if it's relevant. I'm just going to start talking about toothbrushes and vacuums, random things. And what I really want to be focusing on, similar to the last point, is sort of the whole process. So at the minute we just talked about dementia resolve. I love to get more involved with sort of cameras and talk about lenses and laptops and PCs and sort of the whole spectrum of creating videos. And hopefully I can get some of those brand deals and collaborate with the companies so I can bring that information to you guys. I recently released some free transitions, which you all really, really liked. And you donated. Oh, forgot to mention, thank you all for those donations very much. Everyone they've donated for the transitions. Mega awesome. Love you all. Thank you very much for that. I'm not going to do any Patreon or anything like that. I did think about it, but I've sort of realized how I want this channel to work. So I'd much rather continue to give you free things. And in return, maybe I'll get like a sponsor here and there and I'll be able to do a sponsored video. And that'll pay me to do whatever to talk about something. And in return, I can just keep giving you things for free. I'd rather sort of get paid by these guys so I can give you stuff for free. So that's how I seek working. I don't know how it's going to work really. I'm just sort of yabbering on. We'll see. What number was that? Three. Number this video is so awfully and so all over the place. This is why I need to do this more. I need to get better at this because I'm all over the show. But there you go. And number four collaborations. Now I don't mean collaborations with brands and that sort of stuff. I mean collaborations with you guys. I want to do much more of that this year because I think that'd be really good fun. But I'm only going to do collaborations if it's worthwhile. If it's beneficial for me and for you guys, I don't want to it's pointless if there's no real difference to just recording two separate videos. It's got the proper amalgamation of stuff. And that's what I really want to do this year. So UK Draw and Adventures, you mentioned me sort of having a look maybe reviewing some of your content. I'll happily do that. What I'd also really like to do is maybe again for you mate is come out, I'll film some stuff with you. Maybe we'll create a vlog for your channel. But I'll be involved with it. I'll help you put it together and make a vlog of me doing that with you. I think that'd be really cool. So if there's any other UK channels, one I thought would be really cool. Clare's RC if you happen to be watching this. Clare is a last that does loads of plays with micro control cars and does a last stuff. That looks really cool. Have a play with some of my drone and cameras and all that sort of thing. I just think it'd be cool for me. And hopefully it'd be good for you as well. And a bit of a collaboration. So if you're a UK channel and that sounds interesting, pop a comment below. We can maybe sort something out. I've got a really busy year so I might struggle for time, getting married, moving house, loads of things going on. But hopefully we have to fit that in. Thanks for watching. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for subscribing. Thank you for watching. Thank you for thumbs up in thumbs down in whichever you prefer to do. Thank you for all your feedback, your engagement. And thank you for helping the channel become what is today. Long may it continue and grow and become whatever it's going to become in 2020. So yeah, thank you very much. I'll see you next time. Hopefully you will get back into the swing of work or school or whatever you're doing very soon. Thank you for watching. I'll see you next time. Bye. Good luck editing that.
