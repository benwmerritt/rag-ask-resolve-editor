This is not a good look. Yeah. What a folks. It's Alex here. I hope you're good. Got another real quick Thursday. Mr. Alex talks video for you today. And it's actually more of an update than anything else, to be honest. I've really been focusing recently on the idea or the importance of getting out of your own way. So one of the things I think that sort of holds me back whenever I create videos for YouTube is I always need to have a point. I always feel that I need to have a teachable moment within all of my videos, which is why I really like doing tutorials because it's really obvious from the beginning. What's the point of the video? I've got a thing which I want to show you. I'm going to show you what it is at the beginning. I'm going to tell you why I think it works and then I'm going to show you how to do it. It's a real simple start, middle and end, but vlogs and just me talking and that sort of thing is what I struggle with because I don't always have a point necessarily to make. And it's difficult for me, especially being British, it's not something that we usually do, to accept that part of the appeal of Mr. Alex Tech may in fact be me in a weird way, not just necessarily the details or the information that I put out, but also people quite like watching my stuff. And that's weird. I find that strange. It just doesn't quite sit right. So sometimes I think that holds me back because I think I'm not going to do certain things. I'm not going to show certain things or do certain vlogs or whatever, because there's no point. It's just me being me. This has actually come from a Joe Rogan podcast that he did with Robert Downey Jr. And they talk about the importance of getting out of your own way. It's really easy to hold yourself back, I think, with negativity and with a bit of doubt and you maybe miss certain things and don't do things that you think might work because you're scared of the outcome. So I'm trying to get out of my own way and just do whatever and try and if I have an idea for something, I'm just going to roll with it and see what happens. So one of those things, which is why I'm making this video, the update side of it, is I've started streaming over on Twitch. Now it's not DaVinci Resolve focused per se. I am going to do some DaVinci Resolve stuff. I'm going to have some guests on at some point, but at the moment I just decided to stream on there, chat to people while I'm playing some games just because I don't really game all that much these days, to be honest. But I figured it gives me an hour or two where I can just sit down, play some games and get to know some more of you guys. People that want to hop into the chat, just chill out with me for an hour or two. I thought it'd be fun. I'm going to stream probably two times a week, I think. The plan is Tuesdays and Thursdays and then go from about nine to eleven UK time GMT, which means tonight in about three hours. I'll be on there. There is a link down in the description. So if you want to come over, you want to have a look, you want to check it out. There's a link down in there. Obviously, as always, no obligations. I have no expectations. Not going to become some crazy popular full-time streamer, but I thought it'd be something fun, get to hang out. It's a nice chill out time. It's a bit different to see me in this formal setting. It's just me chilling out and I can get to talk to you all and I thought that'd be cool. And then secondly, after actually streaming going on Twitch, I got chatting to a few people that joined my stream and we decided it'd be cool to have a Discord setup as well. So I've set up a Mr. Alex Tech Discord channel so you can hop in there as well and come say hello and just chat amongst yourselves and get to know everyone and get to know me a little bit more. And I thought, again, that'd be quite fun and something a bit different. Now, it's not a DaVinci Resolve Discord. There is a DaVinci Resolve channel in there for people to talk about resolve and help each other out. And of course, if anyone asked me a question and I'm able to help, I will, of course, help out where I can. However, there is a dedicated DaVinci Resolve Discord. It's got thousands of members in it and there's loads of really smart people in there that will happily help you out. Many hands make light work, I think is the saying. So rather than posting a question for me in my Discord, if you need help, you're much better off going to the DaVinci Resolve one where there'll be plenty of people able to give you the advice that you need. That's not to say that I won't help where I can, but generally speaking, if you're after some urgent advice, that's the best place for it. This one is a place to chill out, post some memes, have a bit of a laugh and just get to know people a bit more. And I can post some ideas. If you've got any suggestions for videos, you can put them up there. If I've got any queries for you guys or anything I think would be useful. Again, I can just ask it in there and it's a really nice back and forth rather than me, just replying to comments on YouTube videos and talking to you via a camera like this. There's voice chats as well. We might even hop into a few gaming sessions together and all that good stuff. So if you fancy hopping along, again, there's a link down in the description below. Come on over, hop in and hopefully it should be fun. And that's it. This is a really quick one for this one. I just wanted to announce those two things to let you know what's going on. I'm also working on a little bit of merch. I've got these hats really like that. I know the logo, not everyone's too keen, but we're going to see how it goes. I really like it and I really like these hats. We also got some t-shirts that I'm working on, but I'm sort of getting those samples from suppliers at the moment to get the best service I can for what I want to do. So there you go. That's it. I'm going to be back with another tutorial tomorrow and I'm also going to do some more quick tutorials for some of the new 17.2 updates. Things like the fusion bundle. I was actually going to do that tonight, but I got a little bit distracted. So I haven't had a chance to do that tutorial tonight, so I'll get that done over the weekend instead. Anyway, have a great evening. You know, hopefully I'll see some of you either in the discord or on the stream later this evening. Take it easy. I'll catch you next time. See you.
