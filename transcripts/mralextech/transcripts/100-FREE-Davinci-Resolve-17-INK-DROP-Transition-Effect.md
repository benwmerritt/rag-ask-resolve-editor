Hey, how cool are they? Now you do need to be under Vintu Resolve 17 to do this, but it will work on the free or studio versions. And talking of free, the Ink Splash video which I'm actually using to create this effect is also free. It's linked down in the description below as well as a few other clips you could also use if you preferred. Right, let's open up the Vintu Resolve and take a look. So here we are in the Vintu Resolve for on the Edit tab. I've got two pieces of footage set up on my timeline and it's this edit point here where we want to add our transition. Get your Ink Splash. So I'm going to drag this onto my timeline. I'm going to put it on track number two and we just need to make some changes to this so that it will work for our effect. The first thing we need to do, give it a click, open up the effects library, come down to open effects, scroll down just a little bit until you get to the Resolve FX key area, grab a Luma Keyer and then drop that on there like so. Still with that selected, open up the Inspector, go to the effects tab, expand Luma Keyer if it's closed and then just make sure that in the controls you've got this little icon selected like so. Underneath your preview window, there's a little drop down. Use a little drop down, select open effects overlay and then using your mouse, all you need to do is just click within this black area in the middle and that's going to make all of this black the alpha channel so that we can see our footage underneath. Now you need to do that whenever you want to use one of these transitions or alternatively once you've done it like I have just now, give it a click in the Inspector, go to the file, you've got name, give it a name. I'm going to call this Ink Splash, it's about wrong but Ink Splash and then we could put this within a power bin. If you don't know about power bins, I've talked about them quite a lot in the past. There's an old video which you can watch up here which talks about them in just a little bit more detail. So I've got my power bin, I'm going to drag this in that power bin and I can delete it and then whenever I want to use this transition in any project, I go to power bins, I can grab the Ink Splash from there, it's already got the alpha in there so the black is transparent and then it's ready to go. How do you actually use this transition? Well there's just a few more things you need to do, give your Ink Splash a click on the timeline again so it's highlighted in red, open up the Inspector, this time go to the video tab, scroll down to composite, composite mode and then change that to be the alpha. Grab this clip so the one on the left, they start at the transition and you need to drag this up onto video track number three so that it's above your Ink Splash. Then we're going to go to the same place, Inspector, Video, Composite, Composite mode and we're going to turn this one into the foreground. So now we've got this, if I hit play, you've got this black splodge appearing and if we were to put our second clip underneath there, you can see that that splodge is transparent so we've got this effect which looks really, really cool. So then it's just a case of lining everything up. So I want the transition to happen just over here so I'm going to bring this over and if we hit play from there it's going to do something like that, it's starting to look pretty cool. Now you'll notice with this Ink Splash it doesn't fully fill the screen so it doesn't quite work as a transition but it's actually really easy to fix because all we're going to do at this point here, I want this to fill the screen so I'm going to give it a click still within the inspector I'm going to zoom that in so that it fully fills the screen like so. Then if we just go back and hit play it looks like that and looks really, really cool. Now I'm just going to show you another real quick example but we're going to fly through it super fast. This one here is pink and white so you don't need to use black and white, you can use whatever colour you like. So I'm going to grab the Luma Keyer again, we'll drop that on, Effects, we've got the option selected, we're on open effect, the white is more consistent so I'm going to click on the white like so. We're going to drag this clip up, we're going to make this middle one, the alpha, we're going to make the top clip, the foreground, slide everything into place and now we've got this really cool transition. But you'll notice that it's the wrong way around but don't worry that's easy to solve rather than making this middle one the alpha instead make it the inverted alpha so now if we just hit play you'll notice it's the pink or purple in the middle which is the alpha channel revealing everything underneath and we've got ourselves a really quick easy simple but dope looking transition. And that's it, it's as easy as that. Thumbs up if you liked it, comments down below and subscribe if you're new here and you did enjoy this video. Thanks for watching, I'll catch you next time.
