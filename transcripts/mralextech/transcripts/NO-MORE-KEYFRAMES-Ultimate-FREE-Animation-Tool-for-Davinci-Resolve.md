This video was created without using a single keyframe, not one. No keyframes, no curves, no faff. Everything you're seeing was created using my magic animator version 2 tool which is available right now for free and it's awesome. And talking of awesome, this video was sponsored by Audio. We've got in and out animations like whips, spins and zooms, plus mid animations like pulses, rotates and wobbles and it's completely scalable so you can make your animations as long or as as you like. Now you do need to make sure that you're on at least DaVinci Resolve 17.4 to use this and yes it does work under DaVinci Resolve 18. It will also work on both the free and studio versions. So how do you get hold of it? Well it's really simple there's a link down in the description below which I'll take you to my Ko-fi page and on there you'll find my magic animate version 2. Just give that a click and you can download it from there. Now it is free. All you need to do is put a zero in the box if you don't wish to pay or donate anything. Follow the instructions until you get this view content. Give that a click magic animate v2 simply download. Once downloaded it'll look something like this. Don't worry about the long title name that's just an oddity of Ko-fi and you'll get a drfx file. Double click on that DaVinci Resolve will open up and then I'll ask you if you want to install magic animate version 2 simply install and job done. So we've downloaded it we've installed it we're ready to go. So let me open up DaVinci Resolve. I'll show you where to find it and how to use it. So here we are within DaVinci Resolve. Now we're just going to open up our effects library top left hand corner and then within the toolbox we go to effects. Now to the left of effects you've got this little arrow give that a click to open up your folders underneath you should see Mr. Alex Tech. Do that once again to see your magic animate folder give that a click and then you'll see the three files within there. Now the magic animate effect is simply just one effect really but there's three variations in there which just make your life a little bit easier. I'll explain those as we go. So first thing I'm going to grab this png and just drop it on my timeline or lengthen ours a little bit and off we go. Now the magic animate will work on any images so png files any video files as well as titles but if you're doing titles you need to make sure you use a text plus rather than the standard text but for this demo we're just going to stick with this image. So I'm going to grab my magic animate v2 and we're just going to drop it on there like so. Now when you're using this you don't use the transform tools within the inspector so I'm not going to adjust them at all even if I want to make my image smaller. Instead we drop the magic animate on there we go to the inspector and then effects and then within here these top controls are our transform controls so we've got center we can move this around we can zoom in and out we can adjust that aspect at angle we can flip we can adjust the pitch and we can adjust the yours. If we want to reset any of these we just double click on the words to reset them like so or there's a big global reset up in the top right hand corner so I'm just going to leave that where it is for now. Now there's some additional options within here we've also got a drop shadow so we can just drag that up to add a drop shadow we then change the drop shadow angle the distance and the softness so I can make that a little bit harder like so. We've also then got motion blur and shutter angle. Quick note the motion blur really heavy just the way that it is it's really resource intensive it kind of chugs even on my system so generally I don't use it all that often but it is there if you want to. Now it also does only affect the transition aspect not the mid animations again just because it's so resource heavy but I'll cover that in the transitions section and then underneath that we've got an in out speed so this just controls the animation speed for our transitions so by default it's one second but if we wanted it to be two two and a half three seconds or whatever we'd just scroll this up and that will slow down our animations or if we want really fast transitions we can just bring that down like so. Simple now you can always go back and adjust them after the fact it just makes life easier to do them initially you go in you transform it do you get it in the right place add a drop shadow if you want to and then job done and then you can start to mess around with the transitions and we've got essentially five options for your transitions you can do whips zooms spins dissolves and then aspects so let me show you how that works it's really quick and it's really easy so I've got my png all we need to do is open these up and then we just pick the ins and outs so I'm going to start off with zoom because it's really simple we've got an in and an out and then our options so I'm going to move from playhead to the beginning if we just tick in and then hit play you'll see we now have a real simple in animation like so we don't yet have anything out so we're going to tick out hit play and now we've got an out animation like so underneath there we've got these curve options the zoom curve simply changes the animation curve so the acceleration now I can't go through all of these so just experiment with them honestly just play around with them this one on the left will adjust the start of the animation so basically the first half whereas this second drop down will adjust the second half of each of the animations and as a rule of thumb as you go further down this list the faster the animation becomes so sine for example if we play that it's quite slow if we were to change both of these to xbow you can see it's got a much much sort of faster much more acceleration now if none of these curves are doing it for you and you're feeling really jazzy change the curve from easing to custom and then you can create your own curves so all we need to do we can click on the end points and we can use the little handles just to smooth these out we can also click on the line at any point add an additional handle so we can move these around if it's a bit abrupt right click on the point you've got all of these options just go to smooth and it'll smooth that point out and you can just drag these around to do custom curves to get it looking however you want it so let's go with something really crazy like that and now if we hit play it's going to do something like that so you can just use these custom curves to get it looking exactly as you want it now no motion graphics or text animations work without a good soundtrack and some decent sound effects and that's where this video sponsor audio comes in it's a music subscription service that has a highly curated catalog of music and sound effects and that means you're getting the very best stuff that's been handpicked by the guys and girls at audio plus one of the best things for me it's all really easy to find because it has some of the best filters in the game got filters that allow you to sort by instruments theme build up as well as genre and mood so it's really easy to find the music that you're looking for the audio pro license gives you unlimited downloads of all of that music and sound effects and it's available for a special price right now with just 59 bucks for the first year that's a massive 70 off and that pro license doesn't just cover you for youtube it pretty much covers you for everything you could possibly need from video games to podcasts to tv and even films so you know you're covered for pretty much any video project you're going to take on to get started simply head over to audio.com forward slash alex there is a link down in the description below and use the code alex70 to get that 70 off and get started for just 59 bucks simple now we've got our in and out on this we can move it around and we've always got our in and out and we can lengthen it shorten it whatever we need and we've still got these in and out regardless of what we do with this it would just always work and then what we can also do make a little cut in it and now we've got a new out and then another in like so so these in and outs will always work regardless of how long it is where it is or whatever you're doing with it now of course you can combine them so we've got our zoom controls i'm going to untick the in so we've just got this zoom out at the minute and we're going to go to whip and we'll turn on the out for that so now we've got a whip and a zoom out and it gives us that sort of effect i'm going to take in for the whip so now we're whipping in and let's go to spin and we'll turn that in as well and now i've got this really cool little roll in animation now the whip controls are a little bit more complicated but they're still really self-explanatory honestly put your plate at the very beginning the whip scale controls how far you're whipping in from so by default it's one but if we just bring this in we're going to have it sort of just we roll over like so we've then got the whip in angle so at the minute it's coming from over here on the left we can just change the angle so if we want it to come over from the top right like so it's just going to whip in like that we've then also got this whip in spin so rather than just coming in it can also go on a bit of a journey and whip around like so so just have a play with all of those the same goes for the whip out so you can just control the whip out angles independently so you can have it whip in from one side and out another and just mess around with all of these you've got dissolve and you've got aspect so let me just turn all of these off if we just go to dissolve this is a real simple dissolve like so this combines really nicely with a whip so i can just do a really slight whip like so have it dissolve in it just looks really nice and then we've also got this aspect control so let's turn this on for the out and it'll just squish it down like so that's combined with a dissolve and off you go so you just combine these to get the in and out animations that you want cool now we're going to have a look at the mid animation controls and they allow you to do some really funky stuff we've got a pulse effect a shake a wave and a wobble so let me show you how they work so sticking with the same png as before we've got our ends and outs already set if we scroll down we've got this mid animation control if we expand that we've got pulse shake wobble and wave so let's start at the top pulse if we just increase this this is the amount of pulse we're going to get this sort of bouncing effect and we're going to get this little bounce as we go we've got a pulse count so at the moment it's going to do five pulses however long this is which does mean that if i lengthen this out all the way the pulses are going to slow right down so you may want to increase the pulses if you do a really long file but obviously using 20 pulses if it was really short that's going to be really quick and crazy so you just need to adjust that accordingly the scale is basically how far in it's coming so if you want a big bounce like so or just a teeny tiny one and then we've got very similar controls for the rest so the shake angle just confirms how much of a shake it's going to have so we've got 42 degrees and again this one's going to shake five times we can increase that to give it more of a shake we've then got wobble which is just a real random sort of wobbliness and then under here we can change the smoothness so if you want it to be really smooth or really janky we can just mess around with those as we need to and then lastly we've got waviness so let's increase the waviness and then we can change to vertical or horizontal as we need to and as before we can combine these so let's give this a bit of a pulse bit of a shake and a bit of a wobble and now i've got this effect going on now we'll always finish before the end animation so it'll stop and then whip out so it'll whip in and then start doing craziness and again we can lengthen this out we can make a cut it'll keep doing exactly what it needs to do it'll then whip out next one will come in and then it'll start its animation for however long your file is so you never need to have a mess around with keyframes lengthening things out moving things along if you just want to adjust the length of your image or your text how easy is that combine them all mess around get some really cool effects and now for the final aspect of this there is the background creator this i just put in for a little bit of fun allows you to do some really cool stuff if you're using a logo for example so let's have a real quick look at that so we're sticking with this png it's all animated like so and we want to turn this into a little background so what we're going to do scroll right down till you get to the background creator and then all you want to do it seems a bit strange at first but crop in left until you start cutting into your image so that's too fast i'm going to back it off a little bit crop in from the right same again until we start cutting in top and then bottom perfect now i won't look like it's worked at the moment so then underneath there you've got edge behavior change that to either reflect or wrap around so i'm going to go with wrap around and now we've got this duplicating across our preview then we've got zoom so i'm just going to zoom this out and now we've got loads of my logos let's scroll up a bit we're going to add a little bit of pitch a little bit of yore just to make it look a little bit jazzy now if we go to the beginning they're all going to pop in they're all going to do a bit of a pulse like so now if you notice any additional cropping or harsh edges like i've got here because it's pulsing it's growing too big for its box it's cropping itself but it's easy to fix so in this background creator this zoom here basically controls the zoom for the entire background so as you zoom out zoom in we zoom in everything like so if we scroll up to the very top in the transform sections up here this zoom controls the actual image itself so if we zoom this out we can just make it smaller within its box so when it's pulsing it doesn't hit the edges and we don't get any harsh edges much much better real quick and easy to fix so why are the three versions where your magic animate v2 is your do it all if you only want the in and out animations then there's a specific transition one just for that it doesn't have the mid animations included and then if you only want the mid animations there's that one too which doesn't have the transitions so it just makes life a little bit easier and can speed up the workflow and can speed up the processing so there it is there's my magic animate version two let me know what you think down below hopefully it's useful if you've got any feedback do let me know because i'm always looking to improve this for a version 2.1 or even a version 3 further down the line thanks for watching enjoy take easy i'll catch you next time
