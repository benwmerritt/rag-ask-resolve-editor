Music Hello, it's Alex here, just a real quick video update, hopefully this is going to be one take, which will be a first. I had an email this morning saying that my new Sony 85mm 1.8 is due to be delivered on Tuesday, this Tuesday. It's only just been released in the UK and I think I'm going to be one of the first to get my hands on it, well relatively anyway. I'm not usually an early adopter for these sort of things, I usually wait till they're out and they're picking up views and that sort of thing, but I've just sold my 70-200mm so I'm picking up an 85mm. I presume there's probably going to be a few people thinking about buying this new 85mm. The initial reviews so far look really good, it's basically a lower priced batis, so it's comparable to the batis 1.8. Apparently not quite as good as the G-Masler 1.4, but that's sort of understandable, especially when you consider the price difference. If anyone's got any questions, pop them down below. Once the lens arrives, I'll be happy to do a few videos, I might even do a little review, I've never done a review before so that would be interesting. So I can do a little review, maybe answer some questions, do a little Q&A, if anyone wants to know anything about the lens then just ask away and I'll see what I can do. I'll pop an update as soon as it arrives and we'll take you from there. Cool, thanks very much.
