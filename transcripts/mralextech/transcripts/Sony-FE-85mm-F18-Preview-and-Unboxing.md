Music Hello Alex here, I'm trying for photography, quick video, look what arrived, it is here, the new Sony FE 85mm 1.8, I ordered this last, middle of last week from e-infinity, they are not UK based but they have a United Kingdom website, I've had really good experiences with them so far, I've ordered the 60, I've ordered a couple of lenses, they're really cheap, they're really quick, they send you a photo of the package when it's on its way or that sort of thing, highly recommend them, I'm going to get everything insured so I'm not too fussed about the UK sort of warranties but e-infinity do offer their own 5 month warranty as well, so there you go, I recommend that, but here it is, I'm going to open it up in a moment, have a play, I haven't even looked at it yet, I've just sort of done a quick video, as I said in the last video, any questions, let me know and yeah we'll have a good look shall we? So here it is, the Sony FE 85mm f1.8 in its lovely fetching bright homage box, now as you probably already know it's a Sony full frame emote, so works best on the full frame cameras but it will go on your APS-C cameras and it has an equivalent of 127.5mm if you should bet on one of those, it's pretty well packaged, it's sort of compact, it's all jammed in there, we've got some boring stuff like instructions and warranties and that sort of thing, it is of course a 1.8 lens, the minimum aperture is f22, just in case you need to know, and it has 9 aperture blades, circular aperture blades, a minimum focus distance is 0.8 meters, which gives you a maximum magnification ratio of 0.13, now as you can see it does have a round lens hood included, which is always nice, it doesn't normally mean I don't include these within the box because I use them pretty much all the time so I like to have them in there, so that's really nice that it's included, I'll put that side for now, and it feels quite weighty, it's only 371 grams which is quite light but because they're quite small, they always feel quite dense, these Sony lenses, but it feels good in the hand, it's plastic but it's quite a nice plastic, it feels pretty good to be honest with you, on the left hand side you've got the focus hold button which you've maybe you've changed but I quite like having those there, and it's also got the autofocus switch, so autofocus to manual focus which feels quite nice, and then obviously we've got the manual focus ring which is quite well weighted, it's quite, it feels quite good, obviously being Sony it's fly by wire, so we'll just keep turning forever and ever, and here we have the front element, quite a nice big piece of glass up front, it was also worth mentioning really quick, it is apparently a sealed dust and moisture resistant design, so you can take it in windy or light rain conditions which is handy to know, I'm going to get it on the camera now and see how it looks, do some quick test shots in the garden, I'll probably just follow the dogs around for a little bit, and then I'll report back and see how it looks, and I'm back, so test shots done, just had it on the camera for a little bit, it was really well on the camera, sits really well, it's nicely weighted, I'm shooting with the Sony a7 with a battery grip, fits really nice, slight downside, it worked now stand up, it's a bit front heavy, so pops forward, but when it's in hand, feels really good, focus seems really quick, I always just use centre, centre focus is my preference generally, unless I'm doing the facial recognition, the eye focus which I haven't had much chance to try out yet, but you're just using the centre focus, seems really quick, really snappy, it's quite bright outside, so it's good light, so you sort of expect it to be quite good, and it's quiet, can't hear it focusing at all really, and I'd say it's pretty quick, so quite happy with that, had a look at the images on the back of the camera, and they look really sharp, really sharp, I've been shooting a 1.8 just because I want to say it looks like a wide open at 1.8, and it looks really good, I'm going to get them up on the laptop, so I'll have a look, and I'll throw them up on here, so you can have a look, see what you think, depth of field obviously, lovely, really shallow depth of field, so you get nice bokeh, out focus, background all that sort of thing, there's been a few comments about it being a little bit messy to bokeh on this thing, again looking at the back of the camera looks okay, it's maybe not as soft as some of the other 85, some of the more expensive 85s, but it looks pretty good to me, hopefully I'll be able to get out and do some proper shooting with it soon, but any sort of thoughts, pretty good, so I'll have a little.
