## Transcript
Hello, it's Alex here from ImageRiver's Photography, back with another video. I have no one for a couple of weeks, so I thought I'd do a quick update video. I've been on holiday for the past couple of weeks so I haven't had a chance to make a video. I went to Centre Park with the Mrs and it was lovely. But now it's back to the grind. First update, actually, hopefully you'll notice the sound quality has improved. These videos I've finally invested in some audio. It's a Boyo BY-M1. Amazon, 15 quid. You can see it here, a little clip on my mic. Seems really good from one of you who's tested so far. Happy with that, 15 quid. You can't really go wrong. To be honest, it's so much better than the in-camera audio that I was using. So, yeah, 15 quid. Goodbye, that is. My Tamron review is live. If you haven't watched it, go check that out. If you're more interested in the Sony stuff, go check that review out. Anyway, because I filmed all of that review on the Sony 85mm F8, 1.8. So if you're interested in that lens, you want to see what the video's like, head over to my Tamron review because that's all recorded on the 85mm. I've been out with the Tamron, the Sony and my Sony is certainly to 200 as well. I'll try and do a review of all three of them. I've done the Tamron. I'm going to try and do one for the 85mm and one for the Canon. It's the old, it's the F4, none IS. So it's an old lens. There's loads of reviews out on it already, but I might try and do one anyway. I'm out at Kerbera Sprint Track tomorrow. The MX-5 owners club are having a little sprint day there, so I'm going to tag along, take some photos and while I'm there, I might try and do a little tutorial on panning, capturing action and that sort of thing. Someone asked me to do one of them a while ago, so I might try and do it while I'm there, if I can. No guarantees, but we'll shall see. And then in the future, I've got some other little reviews lined up, videos. I want to do a review of those two other lenses. I want to do a review of my Black Rapids strap. That'll only be a quick one. I've also got a capture little clip on, waist thing, I don't know what you call it, a little waist clip for the camera, which is really, really good. So I like that. I'll probably do a review on that as well. So I've got a few things lined up. Hopefully I'll be able to do them once a week-ish. So yeah, I'll keep posting them as I can. Please do like and subscribe if there's any videos you want to see. Post them below in the comments and I'll read them and I'll, yeah, so I can do. Thank you very much.
