We've got some brand new free effects in DaVinci Resolve like these clouds behind me. Plus, there's a handful of more generators, some new titles and a bunch of other little fixes in the brand new just released DaVinci Resolve 19.1 update which is available right now. To get hold of it, simply open up your installation of DaVinci Resolve, it might pop up telling you it's there. If it doesn't, click on DaVinci Resolve top left hand corner, come down to check for updates. The little pop up will appear and if you're only on 19 or an older version, alas give you one to download, you can download it and off you go. If that doesn't appear, just head over to blackmagic.com forward slash support and you've got the DaVinci Resolve 19.1 and DaVinci Resolve Studio 19.1 versions available for you to download. I'd recommend heading here anyway because there is a DaVinci Resolve 19.1 new features guide for you to download and take a look at. So we're going to jump into DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you some of my favorite new features. I've not had long with these either so a lot of it's new to me but let's open it up and take a look. And we're going to kick things off with the new titles and generators. So open up the effects library, come down to titles, scroll down to fusion titles and there's quite a few new ones of these. They're all listed on screen for you now. We've got things like blueprints, circus, there's one called deep, there's one down here called gradient background, there's a gradient outline, there's a nice animated one here called pow. Which is quite cool actually, put that on the timeline, give it a click, pow. Obviously you can give any of these a click, open up the inspector and mend these as you need to so you've got some nice titles. Now all of these or pretty much most of these are simple just text plus so you can just grab them, put them on the timeline, give them a click, open up the inspector and you can see exactly how they're made. It's all the same text plus controls that you're used to. Most of the settings will be in the shading area so you can come and enable things and just have a little play to see how it's all been created. The generators are of course under generators right here in the fusion generators area. We've got this cartoon cloud so we can put that on our timeline, hit play and we've got some nice animated cartoon clouds. We can open up the inspector, we can play with the separation, the vertical separation, the number of clouds, the seeding, the positions, the animation speed, all sorts. Create, I don't know, like a simpson kind of intro thing with that one. It's quite a cool little addition. We've also got this cube array, a disk wall which does move slightly I think. We've got a gradient lines, hexagon glow, honeycomb, radial lines, squares, stage curtains and starfield. Starfield is exactly what you'd expect. You've got a little starfield here and I do like this stage curtains. This one's got alpha built in so let's just grab a video to put underneath this and as we hit play the curtains open up revealing our video underneath. Once again you can come in here and you can mess with all the settings as you need to. So there you go new titles and generators for you to have a little play with. Now I don't know how much I'll use those myself. Some of the generators look nice for background actually but the main thing, someone at Blackmagic is having fun with those which is nice to see and it just means there's a little bit more for all of us to have a little play with so thumbs up there. Now they've also snuck in a sneaky additional effect as well so under effects within the effects library scroll down until you see outer stroke. Now this one's handy. I needed something spiky obviously went with the hedgehog so I've got this hedgehog PNG and then if we grab the outer stroke and drop that on there we just get a nice border around the outside and it actually follows the edges of the PNG. We can change the border width, the border edge type so at the moment it's got harsh kind of rectangles and stuff. We can change that to circle and it's nice smooth edges and then we can also change the color of that border as well. So think of it like a magic kind of border-y tool. It's another one to add to your favorites. Now sticking with the effects library just for a second they've updated the search so that you can search for these categories so if I was to just type in stylize for example it wouldn't just look for the individual effects or titles or whatever that have the words stylized in them it will also look for this category heading which means I can search for all of the resolve effects stylize effects in one go which is nice and handy. Not major but a bit of an improvement. Now what is kind of major they've improved the ability to sync the media pull bins with file system folders. I talked about this in a previous video and they initially kind of introduced it. It's now got better and it will automatically sync your media. This is cool let me show you. So I've got this folder on my desktop it's just outside of DaVinci Resolve this is just on the hard drive itself and I've called it sync demo. Now we open it up we need to make sure there's something in there it needs to contain at least one thing so in my case it's just got this simple video here and I'm going to import this folder into DaVinci Resolve by giving it a click and dragging it over here to the left hand side of my media pool and releasing and obviously it's imported that folder name with that media it's just some random video I downloaded off the internet. Now if we right click on that bin there's an option to resync the media files so if new files appear in that bin it will automatically pick them up but there's now an option to automatically resync the media files so we give that a click so now that has a tick on there and if I was to just download a random video we'll go with this one here from Pexels and we're just going to paste it into this sync demo folder and if you were paying attention you would have seen it automatically updated in DaVinci Resolve so now if we open this one we now have that video within there. Now a real quick note just before I go any further with that if you were to delete the media from the actual hard drive from whatever it will stay within DaVinci Resolve and it will simply show up as missing so you can see I've got my red icon it's still cached so it's kind of displaying it but it has indeed gone which is pretty neat it just means that you can have a folder set up for screenshots or certain videos or certain assets which you use all the time music for example so you can just copy that music dump it in the folder and everything will automatically pull through into DaVinci Resolve. Now talking of music and sound effects if you need either you should definitely check out this video's sponsor Audio. Audio is a music subscription service that has a highly curated catalogue of music and sound effects which you can use for basically any project as that license covers everything from YouTube, podcasts, video games, films and even TV plus there's a huge amount of music covering all genres there's audio originals which is music you won't find anywhere else plus a massive selection of sound effects from ambient noises, transition wooshes, foley and everything in between that audio pro license gives you unlimited downloads of all of that music and sound effects and it's available for just 59 bucks for your first year or if it's only music you need you can get a lifetime license of all of that music for just a one-off payment of 199 bucks. To get started simply head over to audio.com forward slash alex there's a link down in the description below right let's get back to DaVinci Resolve. Now if you've watched my YouTube channel for any amount of time you'll know that I'm a big fan of the DaVinci Resolve timeline and the DaVinci Resolve bin trick which basically means whenever I start any project for YouTube in DaVinci Resolve I can do so by simply clicking on this icon that's on my desktop I double click Resolve is currently closed it's going to open up on its own it should appear in a second it's going to import that timeline start I say brand new project so that we're ready to start kind of doing what we want it's a really quick and easy way to jump into projects. Now I've always wanted to kind of have a preset file structure in there as well so I can say super organized but that wasn't possible it is now because they've allowed DRB template files to include empty bins so let me show you how that will work and I genuinely think you should implement this especially if you're doing YouTube and you kind of starting from the same point every single time you open a new project. So I'm in a new empty project here and what I'm going to do is create a new bin in my media pool we'll call this one alex or whatever and then within alex we're going to create a new bin and I'll call this one OBS for example we'll do another bin called main cam and we'll do another one called audio and then what we're also going to do is drag that sync demo folder into that bin as well and the last thing in this main alex folder or you can set up a separate bin I'm going to create a new timeline we could give this a name and we can set the format the color management whatever to be whatever we need it to be we could even then open this individual timeline change the tracks add more tracks set up some of the audio stuff kind of do whatever you want to this timeline then you just need to export it so we're going to right click on the alex bin come down to export bin I'm just going to save this onto my desktop so I'll hit save and then I can just close DaVinci Resolve so now from my desktop I've got this alex drb I can just double click DaVinci Resolve is going to open because that drb file is associated with DaVinci Resolve it's going to open up a brand new project and import that bin structure so I've got OBS main cam and audio folders ready for some files and in the alex folder I've got a timeline so imports and media and it's ready to go now obviously we also added that sync demo folder as well so what we can then do in this new project right click the sync demo come down to automatically resync the media files so then if it was to download something new or just add it to this sync demo folder it's automatically going to update within DaVinci Resolve handy now they've also added a bunch of kind of quality of life upgrades and some other handy things directly to the edit page and on the timeline and one of the big ones is an improvement to the duck at all so they introduce the auto audio ducking in DaVinci Resolve 19 and basically if someone starts talking it will automatically lower the music and then as they stop talking it'll bring that music back up ducking the audio but previously you could only use it on one track so if you had multiple people talking for example on different tracks so let's say you're doing an interview or whatever you could only point this duck at one of those tracks now you can add multiple different tracks so take this example here it's pretend it's an interview we've got these two tracks with these two different kind of dialogues going on and then we've got our music track down here so all we do we click on our audio three the one that contains our music for example then in the inspector we go to audio and we've got ducker if we enable the ducker we've got source and then the duck level so the source is just my track names i've named them person one and person two so it's nice and obvious now this is what you could do previously let's just knock this right up as person one was talking with this little mac the music would be ducked mini be slightly more mindful of what you're doing but then the music would come up when person one stops talking issues your blaze through everything but that currently is ignoring our person two we've got this little plus now over in the inspector we can give that a click to add another source we can actually add to multiple of these so in my source two i'm going to go person two and now if we hit play with this little mac mini be slightly more mindful of what you're doing if you're using tiny issues your blaze through everything the music's only going to come back up when neither person one nor person two are talking right next up they've made the dynamics and the equalizer way easier to access directly from the edit page so here we are on the edit page first thing you need to do open up your mixer just by clicking mixer top right hand corner and then you'll see the mixer down here right at the very top of each track we've got fx which if we double click will take you to your track level effects we've got ecu which if we double click that this will now open the equalizer for that track and you've guessed it we double click on dy and it'll open up the dynamics for that track as well so that's all really handy what's slightly odd is you still don't get the mixer on the cut page because if you had the mixer on the cut page with the ecu and with the dynamics that would make using the ipad version of DaVinci Resolve way easier because you still struggle to do a lot of the audio stuff on the ipad version if they brought the mixer with those new little buttons over to the cut page that might solve some issues mmm food for thought anyway what's next next up you can change whether the timeline will automatically add new tracks when adding new media so sometimes if you've got media and you drag it on your timeline and you kind of put it in the wrong place it could add a bunch of new tracks which you didn't want basically you can turn that off so in this example i've got video one audio one but this clip here actually has four pieces of audio so what resolve is done by default is it's just created all the different tracks so everything fits and that might not be what we want so now all we can do is click on edit at the top come down to edit options and you've got this automatically create tracks on edit untick that so now if we grab that exact same clip put this down here it's not going to create any additional tracks it's just going to put what we have on one and one so now we don't need to delete any tracks or mess around with the audio properties in the inspector however they've also added the ability to trim audio levels within the inspector so if you do have multiple pieces of audio on a clip you can kind of balance it out before you add it to the timeline which is kind of handy so using that same clip as the example if we double click so that it opens up in my preview go to the inspector go to file scroll down we have the audio configuration and you can see all four of my tracks here if we click on one of these tracks there's this new level control and we can just bring this down or up so for whatever reason this is wrong obviously but if I needed to boost that track I could put that right up so then when we add that clip to the timeline you can see track number two has already been boosted because we set the levels within the inspector it's also way easier to get help in DaVinci Resolve which could mean that this little man right here might be out of a job but what you need to do click on help at the very top and right at the very top of the help menu there is a search so if I was to search for delete gaps for example there's delete gaps and if I hover my mouse over it it will highlight that area that I need so it says it's in edit there it is delete gaps it's got a little marker next to it if I give it a click I'll actually enable it for me if we go back into this menu and we'll do I don't know let's just search for playhead here's all the options relating to playhead now weirdly on mac you also get help topics from the mac I don't know where you get those I'd imagine that's going to disappear soon but the other help bit really useful they've added the ability to set the location of the fixed playhead so if you've come from Final Cut generally speaking and you like the fixed playhead that you get on the cut page as well you can click on this little icon here timeline of view options we're on the edit page and we can click fixed playhead and that's going to give us our fixed playhead so now we just actually drag the timeline back and forth and that playhead stays in the same position but if we don't like where that playhead is if you just hover your mouse over the top of the playhead click and drag we can move it wherever we want so if we wanted to be over here on the left instead then we release and then when we drag the timeline back and forth the playhead stays in that fixed position now sticking with the playhead the clips are always pasted at the playhead position if you never use the ins and outs this probably never bothered you but if you did use ins and outs this one might be a bit of a fix basically what that means is if I copy anything on the timeline set my playhead to a new position and then paste that new thing is going to paste wherever that playhead is so we can just set the paste location previously if you had like an in marked and then you hit paste it wouldn't paste where the playhead was it would paste where the in was over here which could be a little bit annoying toggle track header control states by clicking and dragging again this is actually a bit of a time saver especially if you create loads of different tracks and you want to disable them for whatever reason so take this example it's quite a big project it's got a bunch of different tracks as you can see if I needed to disable a bunch for whatever reason I was going into the color page for example and doing some grade and some of these adjustment clips were getting in the way you used to have to just click on each one to disable all of these now you can simply click the one and drag your mouse up or down to quickly enable or disable them it actually works for all of them it even works for audio so if you want to mute a bunch of tracks we can just click one and drag down click the other one drag back up and job done now you may already know I'm a big fan of the film look creator it's like a film emulation tool they added in the studio version of DaVinci Resolve 19 where they've added one additional control to that which should be quite handy and that is the ability to control the halation saturation so I've got the film look creator open here if we scroll down to halation we can enable this let's give it loads you see it going on over here maybe increase the radius it's really obvious we then have saturation so you can see it's quite yellow at the moment and we can just knock this down to reduce the saturation or boost it right back up now in terms of fusion there's some new stuff on there as well the main thing for me and I know for a lot of other people as well is there's a new tool called the switch tool they can either use this as a standalone tool but you can also use it as a modifier I know a man that's probably talked about it already his name is Patrick Sterling so I'll link his video down in the description below because he'll talk about this in far more detail but as a super quick overview on the fusion page if we hit shift and space to bring up our select tool and we search for switch we've now got this switch tool and we can add this and this can have multiple different inputs so let's grab a background and pop this in the switch so it's kind of like a merge but rather than merging things we can simply now select input one or input zero so input zero is my media in the background is input one so we're going to swap them over now if two isn't enough we can go to the config can add some additional input some additional switches so now let's grab a red background we'll pop this in here then go back to our switch tool we've got a little drop down we can choose between zero or one or two or three or four or five or six now you can also add expressions on this so we can do maths to automatically switch inputs alternatively if we right click on anything we can modify with and switch is also a modifier which allows us to do some pretty nifty things so I'm going to have a proper play with that because I think it will speed up some of the expressions that I like to do rather than doing lots of ifs and this and theirs within a single expression we can just use a switch instead nice and last but not least a couple of things just to wrap this video up and the first one you can now drag to reorder render jobs in the render queue so I've got three jobs set up here and if I want to reorder them I can simply click and drag to change the orders then when I eventually do render them all we can pick which one's my priority and which one I want rendered out first export presets on the deliver page have had a bit of an update as well so on the deliver page on the render settings we've got resolution and frame rate and usually when you click on the three little dots and you save as a new preset let's give this just a random name when we load that in it's going to try and load the resolution and the frame rate which we set when we created this preset but sometimes you may want to load all the other settings but just pick the resolution and the frame rate from the current timeline well now you can so in the resolution option right at the top there is an option for timeline resolution and frame rate frame rate so we set those to that instead when we create a preset I'll just call this new one it's then any timeline that I open within this project all of my settings will remain the same but it's just going to load the timeline resolution and the timeline frame rate I can just load each timeline make sure to use that preset add it to the render queue and it'll be good to go the ability to encode h.265 main 10 formats in DaVinci Resolve on Windows I'm on Mac but it will look the same we can come down to the encoding profile now you're not just stuck with main which is 8 bit you can select main 10 which is 10 bit so if you've used some nice shiny 10 bit footage you can now export that project in h.265 10 bit so there you go there's obviously more it's actually quite a big update I do recommend you go and check out their guide their 19.1 update little document thingy because that covers all of the stuff thanks for watching folks take easy I'll see you next time
