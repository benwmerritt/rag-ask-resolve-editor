Wee hee! Keyframes. Keyframes are the key to animation. So in this five minute Friday video, I'm going to introduce you to the very basics of animating pretty much anything using keyframes on the edit page within DaVinci Resolve. Now keyframes are actually pretty easy to grasp once you know where to look, but are very, very difficult to master. So in this one, I'm just going to introduce you to the general concept of keyframes. So hopefully keyframes become a little bit more approachable. Anyway, enough of all that. Let's get five minutes on the timer, jump into DaVinci Resolve and take a look. So here we are on the edit page within Resolve. Now I'm going to use this PNG file for this demonstration, but keyframes do work on literally anything, videos, text, images, and everything in between. Now the first thing I recommend that you do, underneath your preview window, there's this little drop down, give that a click, and then make sure that your transform controls are on. So you can see the transform controls here. This makes it way easier to understand what's going on. Now I need to resize this, nothing to do with keyframes, but I'm just going to make this a little bit smaller. Now give that a click, open up the inspector, top right hand corner, make sure you're on the video tab, and then within transform. And you'll see all of your transform controls within here. So the right of those controls, you'll see these small little diamond icons. These represent your keyframes. And all you need to do is you click these to add keyframes in specific points. But because keyframes are smart, all you need to do, you set the start point, you set the end point, and DaVinci Resolve will fill in the gaps and do the animation for you. So what we're going to do, I'm going to grab my playhead, and I'm going to go to the point on my timeline where I want my animation to begin. Then I'm going to use my on-screen transform tools, I'm just going to click my mouse anywhere within the box, and I'm going to drag my logo to the point where I want it to begin. Then within the inspector, we're going to click on our keyframe. Now we can either keyframe individual attributes, so we can keyframe the position, or we can keyframe everything that's under the transform. For this example, to keep it simple, we're just going to do the position for now. Once ticked, you'll see it'll go red or orange. It'll change color. And that indicates that a keyframe has been set. If we move our playhead anywhere on the timeline, you'll see now we get little arrows. Because we've gone past the keyframe, we get a left arrow. If we go before the keyframe, we get a little right arrow. Then we can use the little arrows to jump to that keyframe on our timeline. Now what we need to do, move our playhead to the point where we want our animation and movement to end. So I'm going to go right at exactly five seconds. Now we don't need to add another keyframe, because we've already ticked it. It's basically kind of recording what we're doing. It's a simple way of thinking about it. Instead, what I'm going to do is just grab my logo on my preview, and I'm going to move it. And you'll see it's going to form this red line, which indicates our animation. Now here's a real quick tip for you. I'm just going to undo that using control and Z. Still at five seconds on the timeline. I'm going to hold shift on my keyboard, click and drag. And now it doesn't matter what I do with my mouse, it's always going to go in just a horizontal line. Just a nice way of making sure things are a nice straight line. Now if we use our playhead to go back, we can see exactly what's going on. At one second, it's here on the left. And then at five seconds, it's at our endpoint on the right. And if we hit play, it's simply going to move across that line. And it's really easy to visualize with this little red line. It's like a little train track. Now what we can do, we can use our little arrows to jump between the start and the end keyframes, like so. Or on the preview, we can actually just click on this left one to jump to here, and the right one to jump to here. Now what we can do is just click these and move them around. So if I wanted it to start up here, and then down here, we can do so, hit play, and that's exactly what it's going to do. If we wanted to, we could even go somewhere in the middle, drag to add another keyframe, and now it's going to come down, and then ping across. And that, in essence, is the core of keyframes. Let me just undo that. So instead, what we're going to do now is keyframe another attribute. So we're going to give our start keyframe a click. And what we want to do is to add some rotation. So at this point, I want it to be that way around. So I'm going to come to my rotation angle and add a keyframe. And then down here, we're going to give this keyframe a click. At this point, I want it to have rotated all the way around 360 degrees. Because I want it to go clockwise, I'm actually having to put minus 360 within our rotation angle, or hit enter. And now if it goes to the beginning, hit play, it's going to roll down our hill. If we play this back, you'll see there's no acceleration. It's what's called linear. So it's just moving, and then it stops all of a sudden, which doesn't look very good. So what we're going to do, we're going to click on our keyframe, then within our inspector at the position, right click on the actual keyframe on the right hand side, and change that from linear to ease in. Now we're going to go to our start keyframe, and do the same thing, right click, and ease out. And now what's going to happen is it's going to start off slow, speed up in the middle, and then slow down and come to a nice stop at the end. And it just makes the animation look much nicer. We can do the same thing for rotation. So we're going to click on our start, rotation angle, right click, ease out, end keyframe, right click, ease in. And now everything's going to start off slow, speed up in the middle, and then slow down and come to a nice little end. Keyframes, not as complicated as they look. Hopefully that made sense. If it did, make sure to give me a like, and let me know down in the comments section below. Make sure to also subscribe if you enjoyed this video, because we've got loads more Five Minute Fridays coming up. And next week, we're going to take a look at some really basic stuff, but really key stuff on the Fusion page. So hopefully, I'll see you then. See ya.
