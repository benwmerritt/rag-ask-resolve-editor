What if I say Mr. Alex Tech and I've got a one minute one day for you today doesn't really work that does it but if you're using the free version of DaVinci Resolve and it keeps this pop up whenever you try and grab my magic anime for example or any other effect from within the effects area of the effects library on the edit tab of DaVinci Resolve. Well, it's because of the hover scrub preview. As soon as your mouse goes over any of these effects which are limited to the studio version, it tries to give you a preview. It's not available to you so it shows up the error. Now just for your reference, those which won't work in the free version of DaVinci Resolve are the CCTV effect and the drone overlay effect. All the other ones should be good to go. So what you need to do, open up the effects library. Doesn't matter in what section you're in, just come to this little icon here, these three dots, turn off this hover scrub preview. And then when you go to the effects library, nothing will happen when you hover your mouse over any of these. So you can just go to the one you want, magic anime for example, drop that on there and you've got no issues at all. Now if you do want that preview back when you're looking at video transitions, for example, just remember three little dots, turn it back on and then you are good to go. And there you go. Easy as that one minute one day done. See ya.
