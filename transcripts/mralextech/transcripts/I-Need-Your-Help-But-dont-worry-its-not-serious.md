Yep, definitely news. Ow. I always get asked when I do these videos, why I'm wearing a big fluffy hat indoors. Well, it's simple. It's been cold today. We've had loads of snow. It's like zero degrees all day, and there's no heating in this room. There's not a radiator in sight, so it gets a bit cold, hence the big jumper and the big fluffy hat. So there you go. That answers that first question. Anyway, what up, folks? How you all doing? It's me. I haven't made a video for like two weeks-ish. I haven't put a video up on the channel for a couple of weeks, so I figured I'd hop on and just have a real quick, casual, relaxed chat with you guys. Now, the reason I'm here is because I've been trying to come up with a plan, trying to come up with a schedule going forward for the channel, for the videos, and I think I've kind of cracked it. I may be trying to cram too much in, but I think we can potentially do it. I've actually got someone now helping to edit my videos here and there, which will take some of the pressure off. More on that another time. But I think I've come up with a schedule, so I wanted to share it, get your thoughts, but I also do need your help. I'd be really appreciative of your input on something as well, which I'll come back to in a moment. So, first things first, Fridays. I haven't been particularly consistent with them. I will get more consistent with them from like tomorrow. There will be a five-minute Friday to the of tutorial every single Friday. That is the plan from now until, well, until at least the end of the year, one video every single Friday. That will be the standard DaVinci Resolve video where we just run through fun things to do, basic principles, I'm gonna try and cram loads of cool stuff into those five-minute Friday videos. So we're gonna see how they go. Obviously, you know about the five-minute Fridays because that's kind of the thing that really built this channel up. So, I also want to do two additional videos per week. Now, that may be too much. We're gonna try it. We'll see how it works. We may need to sort of dial it back down, but I figured let's just go for it and we'll see what happens. The other video will be mid-week. So I'm aiming for Wednesdays. I'm gonna do a longer form Wednesday videos. It's not always going to be DaVinci Resolve. Sometimes it'll be a DaVinci Resolve tutorial. It may be something a bit more techy. It may just be me talking about something which I find really interesting, which I feel that may be interesting for you. It's still gonna be relevant. I'm not gonna start talking about plants and sheds. Whatever, you know, I'm not gonna be talking about completely random, obscure things. We're not gonna do pointless of vlogs either. Come back to that in a moment. It will be videos with a structure, with a subject, with a point. That point just might not always be DaVinci Resolve. But I'm really looking forward to getting stuck in and doing some other stuff. A really good example of the thing that I'd quite like to do more of was my 4K video, why I don't always edit in 4K, where we talked about the principle of resolution rather than it being specific to resolve, just exploring that sort of thing. As well as, yeah, just jumping around and having some fun. Do something a bit different, really. It'll be more fun for me and hopefully it'll be really interesting for you. I've also created, well, I haven't created, I also have a vlog channel. This channel has been attempted a few times and every single time I've failed, it was like a vlog channel that then it went to a gaming channel that then went back to a vlog channel and I've just never been able to make it work. I've already tried twice this week to go out and do some vlogging and just sort of document what's going on. These videos don't have a point, it's just me, you know, talking, which is why I'm not gonna put them on this channel because, you know, they're too broad. But I keep failing because I'm not very good at talking in public. I'm not very good at just waffling on when I don't really have a point. I don't really have anything really worth talking about. It's just documenting and just following along vlogging. I'm not very good at it, but I'm gonna keep trying. So I've linked that channel down below if you wanna go have a look at it. I make no promises because I've promised things in the past and found miserably. So it's there if you wanna have a look, if you don't, you probably won't be missing much. I'm a terrible salesman and a terrible marketer. But there you go. Now, the main reason, the other thing, the thing I need your help with, a year or two ago, I started a news series. So every week, the plan was to cover a bit of news. Cause again, it's something a little bit different. I liked the format. The format was quite fun. It didn't take loads of planning. Like some of the adventure-resolve tutorials can take ages to learn the stuff. Some of the longer form videos I want to do will take a long, long time. The news should be fun. I can hop on every week. Can talk about what's going on. It should be a fun, light-hearted little video. So that's what I need your help with. I will try and keep my eye to the ground. I will try and keep my ear to the ground. Yep, definitely news. Now, to listen out for news and see what's going on in the world. I don't just want to cover the adventure-resolve. I want to cover obviously the adventure-resolve and black magic and filmmaking and all that sort of stuff. All that broad area that we're all interested in. But also tech and cameras and not really obscure things. But you know, Canon are releasing a brand new cinema camera. Let's talk about that or things like that. If someone on YouTube, like within our niche, is doing something interesting, we'll talk about that sort of thing. But there's probably going to be stuff that I miss. So if you come across anything, if you find anything that you think would be interesting and interesting bit of news, just forward it to news at MrAlexTech.com. That's news at MrAlexTech.com. Articles, YouTube videos, just whatever. If you find something which you think, maybe Alex should talk about this on the news. We'll send it to Alex. Please do, just ping it over to me. If I think it's relevant, I'll gather those things during the week and then that will be the news video. We're going to aim for every single week. I'm going to script them enough to get the information in them. But then it will be like this. It's just me just talking off the cuff without really scripting anything. So I want them to be kind of fun and I've said fun a lot. I want them to be funny, enjoyable, reactionary, lighthearted, whatever you want to call it. It's just a good time. You want to have a good time with the news and it will only ever be good news. That's worth pointing out. There's too much crappy, miserable news out there. You can go find that somewhere else. We'll just talk about the good stuff, the happy stuff. The good news, I really want to commit to Mr. Alex Tech. Not that I wasn't ever committed before, but I really want to commit to it. I want to try and get people around me to help and I really want to see what we can do with this obscure, weird, Birmingham, Brummie guys YouTube channel. Yes. I don't know, let's just see what we can do. Now it's really my main focus. It's my pride and joy. I want to see what we can do with it and where it might take me. So, here you go. That was all I had to say. Thanks all for your continued support. Please do email me, news at Mr. Alex Tech. If you're coming across anything interesting at all, have a fantastic Thursday evening or whatever day it is when you watch this video and keep your eyes peeled tomorrow, Friday, video linked here for the, actually it won't be linked, but you may be linked here if you're in the future for the five minute Friday video talking about compound clips. Take it easy folks. I'll see you next time. Bye.
