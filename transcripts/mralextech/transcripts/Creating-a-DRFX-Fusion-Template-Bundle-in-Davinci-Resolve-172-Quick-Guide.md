What up, folks? It's Alex here at MISTRADICTECH, and following on from the release of DREAM, which results 17.2, about lots of people asking me to do a real quick video just demonstrating how to create those DRFX template bundle files. So here it is. Here's a real quick video just showing you how. Now it is actually really simple because basically all you're doing is creating a folder structure on your operating system, zipping it up, and then changing the file extension. That's all you really need to do. Now Blackmagic have actually released a readme file which does give you some basic information about how to do this. So first of all, let me just show you how to find that. Open up DaVinci Resolve on your PC, click on Help at the very top, go to Documentation, and then Developer. A file explorer window like this should open, and then you just need to open up the Fusion Templates folder. Now if you're on Mac, you actually then need to open up the Developer folder, and then within Developer you'll find the Fusion Templates folder. Within there, there's a readme.txt. Double click on that to open it up. Now there's loads of good information within here. There's information about Fusion Templates, how to create Fusion transitions, and all of that sort of good stuff. If you scroll down right to the bottom, you've got information on the template icons because they've actually introduced a new method to import your own icons into DaVinci Resolve which is really cool. The template paths, which gives you some juicy information about where you actually need to save your dot settings files too. And then right at the bottom there's DRFX bundles where it gives you a brief piece of information about that. Now what we really want to focus on just above that is this here. Your template should be saved in one of the following subdirectories according to its purpose. Transitions, titles, generators, and then effects. So we can actually use that file structure to create our DRFX folders. Now one quick thing to mention, you do this at the very end of the process. So just create your Fusion macros exactly the same as you usually would within DaVinci Resolve and then export them as either groups or a macro, a dot settings file. And then after you've generated them, that's when you can turn them into the DRX files. So you don't actually need to do anything differently up until that point. So on my desktop, I've got this folder here. I'm just going to open that up. And then there I've got a couple of dot settings files which I want to turn into a DRFX file. Now four of these are transitions, these top four here. And then this bottom one is an effect. So we just need to create the right subdirectories for those. So the first thing you want to do is just right click, create a new folder. And the first folder needs to be called edit with a capital E. And then we're going to double click to open that. And then within here, we need to create whatever folders we need. So in my case, it's transitions. So I'm going to click on new folder, transitions. And then I'm going to right click again, new folder and effects. Then I'm just going to go back. I'm going to grab my effect, do a control C, just to copy that. And we'll paste that into the effects. Then I'm going to grab my video transitions, control C, jump into transitions, control and V, just to paste. And there we go. So we've got edit, our subdirectories, effects, transitions, generators, titles, that sort of thing. And then within there, we've got add dot settings files. Quick editor note, for this demonstration, I'm obviously using the effects, generators, titles and transitions, everything that appears with under edit. But you can actually do the exact same thing for fusion as well. So if you've created any fusion macros, you just use the word fusion rather than edit when you're creating your file directory. And then you can use any of these subdirectories, backgrounds, generators, how to, looks, et cetera. And then drop your settings files within there, do the exact same thing, and they will appear within the fusion category rather than the edit category. You can even create a single DRX file, which contains both edit and fusion, if you want to import to both categories. We then just need to go back to where you can see the edit file itself. We're going to right click, and we're going to send to compressed zip folder. And that'll create a zip folder. If you're on mac, you just need to right click and then click on compress, and that will do exactly the same thing. Then all we need to do is to change the name of this folder to whatever we want it to be. And then we need to change it from a dot zip to a dot DRFX folder. Now, if you're on mac, it should be easy enough for you just right click, rename, and then you can change the whole thing. On Windows, there may be one thing you need to change beforehand. So here you can see that I've got edit dot zip. So I can actually see the words dot zip at the end. If you don't see that, if you just see the word edit, you just need to turn something on. So at the very top of the folder, you should see the word view, give that a click. Over on the right hand side, you've got options with a dropdown, click that and then change folder and search options. The folder options window will appear like so, click on view at the top, and then you should see you've got hide extensions for known file types. Yours is probably ticked, so just untick that and then click on okay. And you'll now see the edit dot zip file. So then if we just right click, rename, we can call it whatever we like. I'm gonna leave it as edit and just change it to a DRFX file. It'll ask me if I want to confirm that. It may become unusable. Click on yes. And then you should see you've got the little DaVinci Resolve icon to the left of that now. So that's perfect. So now that's done, I can actually just import that into DaVinci Resolve. So I've got DaVinci Resolve open. I'm gonna jump into the Fusion tab. We're gonna grab my DRFX file and just drop it anywhere here within the nodes. It'll ask me if I want to install, edit. This will add this selected template bundle to the effects library. I can just click on install. And now if we open up template, edit and effects, we now should have the video through text. And if we go to the transitions, scroll down. We want to have the clean down, left, right and up as well. Now, for some reason, they won't actually appear within the edit tab just yet. What you first need to do is just close DaVinci Resolve. And then once you've restarted DaVinci Resolve, shoot back into effects. And you can see I've got my video through text. And in my video transitions, I scroll down. I've now got my Mr. AT clean. And it's as easy as that to you export your settings files as normal. You just create a real basic folder structure, zip it up, change the format, and then you're good to go. So if you enjoyed this video, please do give me a thumbs up.
