My forehead's getting bigger look. That bit's going backwards. Oh, what a voice. It's Alex here. I hope you're all good. Saturday, I'm just sort of chilling. I've got a few jobs to do around the house and bits and bobs, but nothing too exciting. So decided to do a real quick vlog. I've got a few things that I want to say, two things to mention to update you all on. So first things first, go take the dog out. So I might as well bring you along for that and we'll go take him for a good run and we'll chat along the way, shall we? So yeah, let's go. You're going for a walk? Yeah, he does. Always got to make sure you have poo bags. The joys of dog ownership. All right, now before we get into all that I suppose, just want to say a real quick thanks to you all. 48,000 of you now, subscribers on this channel. So I'm closing in on that 50K. It's come again, once again, way, way quicker than I expected. It doesn't feel like that long ago when we hit the 30,000 mark, that flew by and then we hit 40K and that's flying by when nearly at 50. So yeah, it's just a bit insane really. The five minute Friday series was the thing that really kicked this channel off. I think it's the reason most of you are here, is the DaVinci Resolve stuff, which is awesome. It's not going away, don't think that it is, but I'm not going to do a five minute Friday every Friday. You're still going to get a DaVinci Resolve video every Friday, but they're not always going to be five minutes. I've done nearly 70 of them now, I think, and it's starting to get to the point where the five minute time limit is actually starting to be a little bit restrictive. So I want to be able to just open up and maybe create some longer videos on certain weeks and just do different things. You all know I've been a bit loose with the five minutes anyway, sometimes five minute Friday would be like nine minutes, but I'm officially going to sort of drop the five minute moniker every now and again just to be able to create some longer format videos. If I think something's suitable for five minutes, I'll do it in five minutes. I won't just waste your time talking about nonsense, I'll keep to that five minute mark, but a slightly longer timeframe just gives me a bit more scope to be able to do different things. And some of you are asking for some tutorials which I could try and brush and cram into five minutes, but we better take my time, go through some different stuff, maybe show you some more fusion stuff, which is naturally just a bit lengthier, and then yeah, we can just spend a bit of extra time talking about some of the stuff. So there you go, hopefully that's not bad news for any of you, maybe it is. I don't know. Good boy. Alright, this could end badly. Let's try and get down here without falling. Oh, it doesn't feel promising. Right, now topic number two, YouTube tips. Would some YouTube tips and tricks and tutorials that the things I use to create this YouTube channel be handy? And I mean, besides obviously, dimension result. So there's a few third party things which I use and I really quite rate. And I could also talk about the analytics and how you can not manipulate things, but how you can read your analytics to make decisions going forward on how to grow your channel. Obviously there aren't any magic formulas to instantly have a super successful YouTube channel, but there are some things that you can do to make the most of it and sort of play the game because YouTube is a game at the end of the day. Of course you can make money off it, of course you can be successful on it, but you have to sort of play the YouTube game. That doesn't mean changing who you are or changing the videos that you want to make, but making use of the tools that are there to read your audience and then make strategic decisions from there is definitely something you should all be doing if you have a YouTube channel. If I can show you how I edit my videos, awesome if I can give you tips on the editing side. Amazing and then I can show you some other quick tips when it comes to actually uploading them to YouTube. Winner, perfect. Maybe they'll help, maybe they won't. If they do help and you get to like 200K, remember me when you get there. Or you're gonna jump it, come on then. Really, this way. Come on, do it. That was rubbish, wasn't it? That was rubbish. What? Come on then. Ah. Stick it. Do you guys all notice that whenever I do these vlogs, talky videos, I always come to a place like this. Always come to a nice secluded area to do them. It's because I'm still not used to talking to a camera in public, honestly. Makes me anxious, nervous and just feel uncomfortable. I'm getting better, I am getting better. But every time I try, I sort of fail a little bit. So, of course it's quite nice. Come out with a dog, I'm under no time limit, I'm under no pressure, I'm just wandering around and it's quite nice actually. You should try it. If you don't vlog and you've got your phone or your camera or whatever, even if you don't plan on publishing it, if you like me, you've got a dog, go for a little walk. Just talk, even if you just use your audio, make some audio notes, quite stress relieving. Get stuff off your chest, just talk to yourself. Never okay, what you're talking about actually, you don't even have to be interested. Just waffle. Oh, I wanna say waffle. It's the thing I say quite a lot of people are like, what do you mean waffle? Waffle, when you just talk nonsense, you just waffle on. Just waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle. I waffle all the time. Go on. Go on. I've just gone past the lady pushing a dog and pushed ya. That's a bit strange. It did look old, I'll give her that. So maybe you can't walk, but it looked very odd. I've never seen that around here before. There you go. All the back in the warm, rolls rolled in something. It absolutely stinks. So we're just gonna need a shower now, which I didn't wanna have to do, but we will. So there you go. An appropriate mug, I think. What was the last thing on the list? Oh yeah, new channel. So, I've decided to make a new YouTube channel. It's just called Mr. Alex Life. I did put it in my community page the other day. You may have missed it. Basically, the reason for this is, I'm gonna keep doing these little vlogs on this channel. If I've got something to say about the channel, or I wanna talk about a new piece of tech, or some information that I think would be useful, or once Corona is out of the way, if I go back to Expose, or you know, all that sort of stuff, I will do vlogs on this channel. Don't think I won't. But there's some things which are just thing that aren't relevant for a lot of you, like my mountain biking stuff. I'm having loads of fun with that, I'm keeping fit. I'm back at the gym, so I'm really enjoying going to the gym. But anything I think that won't be relevant to the vast majority of you I'll put on my other channel. Now, if you do wanna see some of that other stuff, bike videos, random nonsense, me just messing around, talking about the other things that are like, frit of rate to come over, say hello. Mr. Alex Life, it's in the description. So give it a little click and go subscribe if you want to see it say hello. Hopefully we can build a bit of a community over there. Also a nice thing with that channel is I don't need to worry about quality quite so much. I can just throw whatever up there and if it's what's an all, if I've made a mistake, I don't need to worry about 50,000 people seeing it because I know there's only gonna be a handful of people seeing it. So yeah, it just takes the pressure off. There'll be no schedule, it'll just be as and when. I can have a bit more fun with it. Come on then, you're in your bed, because you stink, you are absolutely the arancism. I'm also a little bit curious to see how I can grow it. I've learned loads over this, I don't know, two ideas, or whatever it's been since I started, or since I've really put loads of effort into this channel. I've learned a lot about YouTube and how it works. So I will put a little bit of effort in and I'll report back on the results as it goes as well. So yeah, if you found it to be following that, link in the description, go check it out, say hello. Even more of my face to keep you occupied. Must be mad, all of you. Mad. Right, and that's about it really. Gonna sit down now, edit the video on the laptop, which I need to talk about on the channel. I've actually formed a reasonable opinion of it now, the pros and a couple of cons with this laptop. Overall, I'm well impressed. I will edit this video, this video was all shot in 4K. I won't use any proxies, I won't create any optimized media. I'll run it directly off this external SSD in 4K, on a 4K timeline and it'll be absolutely fine. It will get warm and make a little bit of noise, but you can do it on in real time, edit it without too much hassle at all. So for that sort of thing, it's pretty good, but there are a few things that are a bit strange with it. The screen's not great, especially for color grading. Anyway, I'll get into that in a separate video. But yeah, we'll sit down, we'll do that now, and then I'll let it on the channel. You'll probably be watching this today. Thanks ever so much for joining me on the channel, all your ongoing support, everything else that you all do. If there's anything you could do on this channel going forward that you don't like, just let me know. I'm all ears, just write in the comments and we'll take it from there. But yeah, you gotta play with things and see how it all goes. Anyway, hope you all have a really good weekend. Take it easy, I'll see you next time. I'm gonna finish my coffee. See ya.
