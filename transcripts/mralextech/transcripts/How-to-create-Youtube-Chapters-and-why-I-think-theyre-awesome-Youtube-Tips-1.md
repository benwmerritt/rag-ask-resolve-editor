What up, folks? My name's Alex. This is Mr. Alex Tech. And in this video, we're going to be talking about YouTube chapters. Now, I'm going to spend a moment or two just talking about why I think they're really important. If you don't care about any of that, you just want to see how they're made, you can use the chapters on this video to skip to that particular section. So, first thing's first, what are YouTube chapters? If you have a look at this video, have a look at the timeline, just at the very bottom of the screen, you can see that it has clearly defined chapters. And then you can click on those chapters to skip to the particular section of the video that you want to get to really quickly and really easily. They were introduced a couple of months ago onto YouTube and I genuinely believe that every YouTuber should be using them in all or at least the majority of their videos. Now, why? Well, I think they're really important for two simple reasons. The first reason is it has the potential to save your audience time. You should never knowingly waste someone's time, especially on YouTube, if you're looking to grow and gain an audience. We all know how annoying it is to jump onto YouTube, you find a video, it's got a good title, it's got a good thumbnail, you think you're going to find the thing that you're looking for. But when you click on the video, it's a vlog, for example, the information may be in there, but it's padded out and there's loads of other things that you're not really interested in, you just want to find this one particular thing. Using the YouTube chapters allows people to click on your video and get to the section they want really quickly. If someone can get to the section quickly, they're more likely to give you a thumbs up, maybe subscribe because they like the way that you do things. Now, as YouTubers, obviously we want watch time, however, you should never knowingly waste someone's time in order to build up your watch time. Someone's much more likely to give you a thumbs up, comment below, subscribe and just generally like what you do. If you're honest up front and you provide the information you said you're going to provide really quickly and easily. Now, link to that is my reason number two. As a YouTube creator, sometimes you do get carried away. Sometimes you don't just want to do a one minute tutorial, you want to do a five minute vlog that contains a one minute tutorial. If you use the YouTube chapters, you still have the creative freedom to create a 10 minute video talking about whatever you like, a 10 minute vlog doing this, that and the other. But someone that's just looking for that one particular information can click on your video and get to it immediately. They're going to be much more likely to give you some positive feedback and maybe even subscribe to the channel. On top of that, if they go to the section they want, you've presented it really cleanly, precisely, maybe they like your personality, maybe then they'll stick around to watch the rest of the video as well. So using YouTube chapters allows you the creator to do whatever you want on YouTube to have as much creative freedom as you want without wasting people's time. You're giving people choice, you've given the option to watch your full video or just get right to the nitty gritty to see the particular piece of information they want. So that's where I think you should be using YouTube chapters. Hopefully that'll make sense. Let me know down in the comments below if you've been using them, if you haven't and what you think to all of that. Right, without the wait, let's open up my YouTube studio and I'll show you exactly how to create the YouTube chapters. So here we are within the YouTube studio. So I'm just going to go to my videos using the menu on the left and it's this top video that we're looking at. Hover my mouse over this pen here which is the details. We'll give that a click and here we see the video description. Now if we just open the video in a new tab and as you can see this video doesn't have any chapters across the bottom of the screen. So we're just going to insert those now. So within the description you can do this anywhere. It doesn't need to be at the top or the bottom. You can put it anywhere within the description. We just need to list the timestamps. Now there needs to be in a particular format and the one that most often people forget is the zero. So you must start at zero zero colon zero zero. This is the very beginning of the video and this is generally going to be your introduction. So I'm just going to put intro. We'll hit enter to go down to the next line. Now all I generally do is skip through the video, find the particular points. So we've got 25 seconds. We go into the first example. We can skim through to the next example and you just go through the video finding the key moments, the key chapters that you want to be included within the YouTube chapters. So my next one is at 453 and then we'll skip through just to find the outro which begins at eight minutes and 24. Now remember for them to work you must start at zero zero colon zero zero. As far as I know there isn't a maximum so you can have as many as you like. However there is a minimum. You need to have at least three timestamps and they need to be listed in ascending order. And lastly the minimum length for each of the chapters is 10 seconds. Once you've done you've listed them all you've started at zero you've put all of your different timestamps you can just hit save and now straight away there's no waiting if I just jump straight back into that video. You can see straight away we've got the YouTube chapters appearing at the bottom of the video. People can skip to the section they want to. They can also open the description and see the timestamps within there as well. And that's it I hope you enjoyed this video if you did give me a thumbs up any comments or feedback or thoughts pop them down in the comments below and if you did like this video and you're new here you want to see some more YouTube tips, some DaVinci Resolve tutorials and some general tech maybe consider hitting that subscribe button.
