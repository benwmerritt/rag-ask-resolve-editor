Depth Map is an incredible new feature within DaVinci Resolve Studio 18 which will automatically pick up on foreground and background elements, allowing you to do selective colouring, but titles or other effects behind people like this, and you can use it to do some really cool practical effects like blurring everyone within the foreground like this, and even create fake depth of field effects like this, all without doing a single bit of tracking, making the entire process much quicker and much easier. This is limited to the paid studio version of DaVinci Resolve, it's not available within the free version, and that's because it's using the DaVinci Resolve Noro engine which is the AI engine, which actually leads me nicely onto this video sponsor. Nvidia Studio and Scan Computers Nvidia Studio is a new software and hardware platform utilising technology to make creative work easier and more efficient. RTX Studio high performance systems are loaded with the world's most powerful Nvidia GeForce RTX GPUs, and those GPUs have dedicated AI tensor cores which accelerate the DaVinci Resolve Noro engine, ensuring you can run the new DaVinci Resolve 18 effects like the depth map and surface tracker, as well as older effects like magic masks, speedwarf and phase refinement effortlessly, and Scan Computers are one of the biggest and most trusted resellers of Nvidia Studio certified products in Europe, so click the link below to check out their line of Nvidia Studio certified laptops, plus their own line of award winning 3XS Nvidia Studio approved custom systems built specifically for creators. This video was actually recorded on my very own Scan 3XS system running in Nvidia RTX 1390, which of course makes light work of those new depth map effects. So first of all, where did you find it? Well it actually exists within the effects library, under open effects and the refined area on both the edit page and the color page. Now there is a distinction between the two versions. I found the version on the edit page is best if you just want to really quickly mask something out, whereas the version on the color page is best for obviously color grading but also applying some selective effects. Now for this quick opening demo I'm going to show you it on the edit page just because it's slightly more visual, but then we'll go into some real life examples towards the end. So let's open it up and take a look. So I'm on the edit page, I've got my effects library open, open effects and then within refine, depth map, we'll drop that on this footage here. So I'm going to open up the inspector, go to effects, open effects and I've got all of my depth map controls within here. Now I'm going to set the quality to faster because it just means that I get full real-time playback and it makes for a slightly nicer demonstration. So what's going on? Well it's actually quite simple. What DaVinci Resolve has done really cleverly is it's figured out whatever's in the foreground and the background. So the foreground is represented by white and then background is represented by black. And anything that's black is going to have an alpha. So that's going to be transparent. So what I'm going to do, just to make this slightly more visual, I'm going to grab a generator, four color gradient and put this underneath. So that black area there, there's some trees, we can see this light gray area here, he's kind of light gray, these are all light gray. So there's going to be some transparency over the entire image, but this sky area is going to be really transparent, whereas he's going to be a little bit more opaque. So I'm just going to turn off the depth map preview and that's exactly what we see. This guy is letting in some of the colors through and the bleach is over here, but the sky and the trees are nearly all transparent because that's the furthest away and this is closest to the screen. So how do you tweak it? Well in the effects, you've got a few options. You've got a resulting map adjustment for starters and you just need to take this adjust map levels. And then we've got the file limit, the near limit and the gamma. The file limit allows you to adjust where this background is. So basically this background is quite far away. It's sort of, imagine an invisible line, it's sort of on the trees, we can still see the trees. We want to bring that towards us so that we can get rid of all of the tree and the sky area. And we do that using this file limit. So we can bring our imaginary line closer to us, making anything that's kind of just past this guy in terms of depth will go black, meaning it's more transparent. And again, if we turn the preview off, this gives us a really nice visual. If we increase this file limit, it goes further out and then we can bring it back in. Now our near limits does the same thing, but this time it's for our weight levels. It's for our foreground. So at the minute, our guy here is kind of an off gray, so we will be a little bit transparent. So we're going to move our near limits just a little bit out like so. And again, we've got this invisible line. We're saying anything up until this point, we don't want any transparency. We want it to be completely opaque. So we can move this near limit all the way out to the trees or just encompassing this guy. Again, if we turn the depth preview off, we can see our little line going all the way out. So anything in this foreground area here, we don't see any of the four color gradient underneath. We don't want that. We basically just want the guy. So we're going to go something like that. And there we go. The gamma, the gamma represents the fade between the light and dark areas. So it's kind of like a contrast. We can make it so there's a real big fade between the two or we can make it so it's quite a harsh line between the foreground and the background like so. And there we've got this. We've got an isolate specific depth and we've got isolation. So I'm going to give that a tick. This allows us to basically do the same thing, but it's much, much harsher rather than having a nice soft edge, a nice soft fade between the white and the black, the foreground and the background. Instead now we get a real harsh edge so we can move this line. It's much, much thinner. Imagine the line is a thinner line. We're basically isolating subjects. So I want just this guy. So I'm going to make him super white, hot like that. And then everything else is black. So if we were to turn the preview off, we can just see this guy and then we've got the four color gradient coming through pretty much everywhere else except for anything in the scene, which is in line with our dude. We've then got tolerance, which basically just makes that line that we're talking about thicker or thinner. So we can be really precise with what we're selecting. And then we've got the softness, which just softens the edge of that line. Now I'm going to turn my preview off. So we've got this. We've got a nice harsh isolated subject against that four color gradient. Now we need to go down to our map for Ness and we've got post processing. So you can see is quite a harsh edge. Let's zoom in on his hair here. We've got a little bit of sky coming through and we've got a harsh edge here. If we turn on the post processing, that just sort of fades the edge a little bit. So we've got a bit more control. We've got expanded contract blur and post filter. Then we can just contract or expand this mask in relation to our subject. I believe that is is we can then change the amount of blur between our mask. Like so we can have loads of blur or not much at all. And then we've got this post filter, which we'll try and filter out all the differences. Now I found that this is actually quite good at generally with hair and that sort of thing. So it does work quite well. So you want to use all of these controls to try and finesse this mask to get it looking exactly as you want it. Now, I know that example we've done with the four color gradient doesn't exactly look very good, but hopefully it's giving you a good understanding of what all of those controls actually do. Now, in terms of actual practical examples, I've got a few of those set up. So let's take a look. So for this first example, we're going to do some selective color grading. I've got this footage of me in my studio. So we're going to give it a click and then go into the color page. I've got my nodes open. I've got my depth map from my effects library. So I'm just going to drag that onto my nodes and release like so. And now it's all ready to go. Now, that important distinction I mentioned earlier on the color page, the black areas don't necessarily represent alpha. Instead, think of it this way, all of your white or foreground elements are the elements which are going to have your color grade or your effects applied. And then the black areas won't have them applied. So you are kind of masking, but you're masking the color grade or the effect rather than actually masking something out revealing what's underneath. So what I want to do for this example is to do some color grading of either me or the background. So my depth map looks pretty good, but that's a bit gray and I'm a bit faded as well. So I'm just going to come to my adjust map levels. I'm going to bring the far limit in so that the background is completely out. And then I'm going to bring my near limit down just so I'm completely hot white like so. And that should pretty much do the job. Now, we don't want to do the color grading on this depth map node. We want to add a new one. So I'm just going to hit alt and S on my keyboard to add a new serial node. And then all we need to do is drag the little blue box to the blue triangle to connect them up. And then we could do any of our grading on this node here. Now, we do want to turn our depth map preview off so we can see what we're doing. We'll go to our new node. And then all we can do here is any of the color grading that we want to do. So let's say I wanted to adjust the temperature. I could bring this down or all the way up, making me really hot or cold. And if I hit play, it will track it all the way through because it's just looking at our foreground element, not our background element. We could change any of our gain, our offset, do whatever we wanted in here. If we wanted to do the opposite, we wanted to grade our background instead. All you do, hop over to our depth map, choose invert. That will switch it. So now I'm not selected. The background is instead, we'll go to our grading node and then let's just do the same thing. Let's measure their offset. It's nice and obvious. We could bring that up or down as we need to. As you can see, my mask is a little bit harsh. So we're just going to go back to my depth map, go to our post processing, turn that on. Straight away, that's actually done a pretty good job of just adding a bit of finesse to the hair and a bit of blur around my shoulders. So I think that'll do the job. Let's say that I actually wanted to just bring this temperature up and maybe lift up the gain, bring down the shadows, whatever, add a bit of contrast to the background, something like that. You can do it really quickly and really easily. Simple, selective grading done. Now we're going to stick on the color page for a couple of examples, but this time we're using blur. So this is the example we used at the beginning. It's just me in front of the TV and I want to pixelate myself. So I've already got my depth map on there. We're just going to toggle the preview on so I can see what we're doing. We're going to adjust the map levels for starters because we want to bring the background completely out and then we want to bring me so I'm nice and white. Let's just track through. That looks pretty good. There's a few other bits coming in. So what I'm actually going to do is just add the isolation as well, which should get rid of most of those. That's looking pretty good. We'll come back to the post processing. We won't worry about that for now. I'm going to add my new node, Alt and S. We'll connect the blue to the blue. We'll go back to my depth map. I'm just going to turn off the preview. Go back to our new node and for this one, I'm just going to use the mosaic blur, which on this new node because our node is downstream from the depth map. Our mosaic blur will only be applied to anything within our depth map. So ie, that's me because I'm in the foreground. Now there is a bit of a harsh edge. So I'm going to go back to my depth map. We'll apply the post processing on this one. For this, I think I just want to expand it. There we go. That looks pretty good. And now we've got me all blurred out in the foreground. Again, if I wanted to reverse this and blur out the background instead in the depth map, invert, the background is completely mosaic pixelated and I'm ready to go. Now, another great example of the depth map is replicating a shallow depth of field or that bokeh sort of effect. So I've got my depth map on here ready to go. We're going to use the depth map preview and we're going to adjust our map levels. Now for this one, because I want it to sort of slowly go out of focus, I'm not going to use the isolation like I did before. I don't want that hard cut. I want it to slowly get more and more blurry into the background. So I'm actually going to leave the far limit as it is. That looks pretty good. It's quite far away. We're actually going to move the near limit out a bit. So sort of this bit here is our foreground and then it slowly starts to fade. I may even just increase the gamma. So it's a nice soft gradient. So our things with our effect applied to those without. So we'll just turn our depth map preview off. Now it's actually not this guy that I want to have the effect applied to. It's the opposite. So I'm going to go to invert. Now I'm going to create my new node Alt and S. Like so, we'll connect the blue to the blue. And then all I'm going to do for this one down here in this blur area here, we've got the radius, I'm just going to drag this right up. And you can see it's starting to blur our background, but it isn't harsh. It sort of slowly gets more and more blurry as things go further into the background. We do have a bit of a harsh edge here. So I'm going to go to my depth map, turn on the post processing. That starts to look a little bit better. I could finesse it a bit more, but it sort of works. And if we hit play, we've got a much blurrier background. Again, you'd want to tweak that to get it just right. But for a real quick example, that doesn't look too bad at all. So as you can see, it works well. And it's actually really quick to do things which usually would be quite difficult if you're trying to mask. Now we're going to jump back over to the edit page and we're going to do some fun little masking. There's some cool stuff that you can do with titles like this, which again, usually would take some masking, some effort. And it's now actually really easy. So we're on the edit page and I've got this footage here with this title. And basically I want the ice skating guy to be on top of the title. So he's moving in front of it. So first thing I do, I've got this clip down here. This is the main footage. I'm going to make a duplicate of this. I'm going to hold Alt on my keyboard, drag up to create a duplicate on this third track. So we've got the footage, the text, and then the footage underneath. So I'm going to grab my depth map. We're going to drop this on this top piece of footage like so. We'll give it a click in the inspector effects. And then we've got the depth map options within here. So same thing again, I just want the focus to be on our guy. So I'm going to adjust the map. We're going to add some isolation. We're going to move the near limit so we can catch him. And we're not going to do too much else really. We'll maybe finesse it a bit. We'll have a look to see how that looks. Now, if we just turn the depth map off, this will add our alpha. So the only thing visible from this top clip is anything that was in the foreground. So now he's above our title. Yes, I'd need to finesse it. Let's go back into the effects. We'll go to the processing. Maybe it works better with it off, actually. And there we go. We've got a guy above our title really quickly and easily. So let's try this last one here. We've got these ladies walking in front. And we're going to do the same thing. So we've got to duplicate this, hold Alt and drag up. We're going to drop a depth map on the top one. We're going to adjust the map levels. And again, all we want to do is to select the people walking past, but not these stuff, these bushes in the background. So we're going to bring the far limit forwards to get rid of those. The near limit just there, even without isolation. That looks like it's done a really, really good job. Maybe a bit off, but let's just try it anyway. Now, if it goes to the beginning, hit play. Our ladies are going to walk in front of our title like so. How awesome is that? It's basically magic and talking of magic. Thank you very much to this video sponsor, Nvidia and scan computers.
