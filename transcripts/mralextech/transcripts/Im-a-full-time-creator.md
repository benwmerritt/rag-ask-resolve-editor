## Transcript
March 13th 2017 A dude with no film or video editing skills or knowledge at all basically decided to release his first video on YouTube. It was a tutorial on how to create low-key product shots using basic equipment and a couple of speedlights. It was filmed mostly on a phone that was duct taped to a doorframe because the tripod and the camera, the original Sony a7, were in use during the video and it was all cobbled together hastily and poorly in filmora. That dude was obviously me and I honestly can't remember why I made that video. What inspired me to make that video? Why I thought it would be a good idea to make that video? Or why honestly I thought anyone would care? But I made it anyway. Now it's cheesy and honestly insane as this is going to sound. Making that video changed the trajectory of my career and my life. Now that sounds really dramatic but it did. April 27th 2018 I bought a drone but that's actually a bit of a lie. It was actually my wife and my family all chipped in to help me buy a drone. It was a DJI Mavic Air, the Flymore package to be exact. I'd been obsessed honestly watching all of this drone footage online when they all started to come out. They were a little bit more affordable than some of the drones that came before it and I just really wanted to get out there and try flying the drone because it just looked cool and I just loved all these videos that people were putting together. So when I got one I just started looking for nice spots in my local area and I went out and I just made these little drone footage compilation videos. They're still on my channel, they're not great but I was just learning the ropes, having some fun and one of the places I used to go was this nice little wood that's not too far from me. This is it. Hey wood, this is the spot I used to come to quite a bit actually to do some some droney stuff. I haven't been here for ages. I'd come here and walk the dog as well. The dog by the way, Rolo, he's all good. He couldn't come with me today, he's had some surgeries on his legs. He's stuck at home but he's all good generally speaking. But those drone videos, they were nothing exciting, it just got me out and about and I got to come out and have a play with them and it was while doing those videos that I realized Filmora wasn't very good, not at the time. Anyway, it was great for transitions and effects and titles as a beginner, you could just throw them on and off you go. But it was kind of lacking everywhere else. As soon as you tried to do any slow motion or color grading or anything like that, it lacked to be honest and that's where I started looking for an alternative and I happened to stumble across to something called Da Vinci Resolve and it was good apparently and for me, quite importantly, it was free. It can get quite busy here and I thought being a Saturday today, it would be quite busy but it's eerily quiet. It's a bit cold, so maybe the cold will put people off but way quieter than I was expecting. Oh, mate. So I gave this Da Vinci Resolve a try and I started to learn it and I started to really enjoy it and going from someone that was purely photography, I just did photography more than anything else, I never touched video, I really started to enjoy the video side, messed around with video and learning all about frame rates and whatever else and Da Vinci Resolve really helped that. But I did find myself getting stuck on an awful lot. Things like not setting your project frame rate initially, no one had told me that you needed to do that and there was lots of strange things which didn't quite do what you'd expect them to do within Da Vinci Resolve and at the time, there wasn't that many tutorials, there were some out there but there wasn't load and load and load. But I was having fun with it, I persevered, I even managed to get some paid work, I made some car videos for a mate of mine, that was kind of paid and that was really, really fun and that really was the point where I thought this video thing was actually kind of cool. I'm enjoying this, maybe I should do more of it. June 14th, 2018, I was walking the dog around these very woods actually and I decided to do a quick video about some of the top tips that I'd learned when using Da Vinci Resolve. So I opened up one note on my phone, I actually dug it out, I'll pop it on screen, there's a screenshot of it, really basic but I just wrote down the five things which I'd learned, five things which I found was difficult to get my hand around in Da Vinci Resolve and I was going to do a real quick video on them. It was called Five Top Da Vinci Resolve Tips for Beginners. Da Vinci Resolve is about wrong for some reason, I put a space in it and two capital letters and originally if I remember right, I used a screenshot of a Premiere Pro timeline in the thumbnail. I didn't think anyone would notice and more importantly, from my list, I didn't think anyone would care. So I published the video, it went live on my channel and to my massive surprise, it did well, really well actually. I had a little burp coming at the end of that. I was going to try and hide it but there's no point, I'm not really recording it because there's no point in that either, so there you go, have a burp. Oh yeah, I'm a YouTuber, I'm recording myself. Yeah I was just getting out of the way to let you pass. Yeah I just talk about a lot of camera stuff, sort of techy stuff, video e-bits. Oh no, I wish, if you've seen me do a backflip, something's gone wrong. October the 11th, 2018. After making some videos about videos and photos and another tech and then attempted some vlogs to very mixed levels of success, I'm really unsure I want to do these sorts of talking videos. I don't find myself that interesting so trying to make, anyway, that's another topic. After a while I decided to make a series of videos on DaVinci Resolve called Five Minute Friday. Now if you've followed me for any amount of time, you'll have heard of Five Minute Friday but it's a five minute tutorial series where I just cover the basics of DaVinci Resolve in a five minute video to help people get up and running and as I was learning Resolve, I teach myself something, I'd learn all the things which the trip begins up and then that would become the basis of the Friday, the weekly Five Minute Friday series and that's where, well that's where things took a bit of a turn. It's now half two so we're going to shoot home, make some pizzas and we'll finish off this little timeline. Hey buddy. Hey, I've been to the table so you're right though. Yeah, hey buddy. So, well this thing's warming up. January the 6th, 2019. We hit 1,000 subscribers. Becky, my wife is just pointing out that it took me almost two years to go from posting my first video to 1,000 subscribers. So, if you're in that position, you just sort of start on your channel and you think you're not doing particularly well. Two years, it took me to get my first 1,000. After then, I really sort of found my identity. I knew what I was doing so things got a little bit quicker but yeah, two years, two long years. I didn't even realise that. I've been making videos for six so I'm old man. I'm old. June 14th, 2019. Made a bunch more videos to varying degrees of success once again. 5,000 subscribers. December 31st, 2019. Kept making videos, 14,000 subscribers. May 17th, 2020. 30,000 subscribers. October 15th, 2020. 50,000 subscribers. June 18th, 2022. 100,000 subscribers. Which leads me onto the next big milestone. Kind of the point of this video. January 31st, 2023. Can't imagine Broodug are ever doing any sponsoring but if you are, let me know. January 31st, what am I on about? Well, that was the day. I took a massive leap of faith, to be honest. It's the day I left full-time employment. As of right now, I'm no longer in full-time employment and that's the first time since I was about 17 when I've not been in full-time employment. Which is kind of mad. I've finally put faith in myself and I've gone full-time, self-employed, freelance, whatever you want to call it. I'd put an awful lot of work into my career, building the career I had because I didn't go to university. I haven't got a degree. It was all just through, I don't know, working and growing. I don't know. But I managed to get to a decent position so it was really, it's a massive deal for me to give it up. But I have given it up. Now I'm here, making pizzas, drinking beer and telling you guys, I'm a freelancer now. Which is cool. And it does, I'm not gonna lie. Feels awesome. Does feel really, really cool. I am actually still working for Kofi. I moved to them not that long ago, just before Christmas. And I'm still going to be working for them but as a contractor. So they are now essentially a client rather than my full-time employer. So what does all that actually mean? Well, it just means that I've got more time to go out and do the things I want to do. I can go out and make the videos I want to make. I can go out and be creative. And I can just do the things I've always wanted to do but haven't had time to do. I want to do vlogs like this. I want to make more travel and cycling, bikey videos. And I want to talk about other things. I also want to really document this process of going from full-time employment to being a freelancer. Whether it's the positives, the negatives, whether I turn this into a massive success or whether I fall on my ass and fail. I think it'd be really cool to document it and just to let everyone know what's going on. Hopefully people benefit from it. Hopefully it's something that's useful for other people that take the jump. I don't know. But the main thing for me is I want to keep developing. I want to keep learning and I want to keep progressing. My plan is to keep making these YouTube videos, to keep making DaVinci Resolve stuff. But I also want to grow myself as an asset. I want to be a YouTuber, obviously, but I could also be a presenter, a teacher, a talker, whatever, you know, go out and do talks to people. An editor, a filmmaker, content creator, all that sort of stuff. And let's say I might fail. There's a fair possibility that I will. But I'll finally take on the jump. I'm going to give it a try and we'll see what happens. So before I did all of this for fun, it was just a little side thing. It was a good little side hustle. It had me some additional money and it was fun. It was my creative outlet. But now, now it needs to pay the bills. So I am going to have to make some changes around here. Not too much. I, as I said, there's loads of those stuff I want to get stuck into. But I have always held back from making like a full on Patreon style membership thing because I've never had the time to commit fully to it and do something really cool and try and help people out and maybe even do some coaching and that sort of stuff. But now I do. I've always given things away for free because I've never had the time to support them. And again, now I do. That doesn't mean the freebies are going away. It's not at all. They're going to keep coming. I've got some ideas for stuff to do. But I am going to actually sell something at some point rather than just working for free and give it everything out. A huge thanks to every one of you that subscribed and watched over the years. Obviously, it's thanks to you guys that I'm here doing this. A huge thanks to audio as well. There's a link down in the description for audio. Make sure to check them out. You get your first year's worth of music and sound effects for 59 bucks. They are sponsoring the channel. So they've really helped in making this transition possible. Now they've got some massive plans for this year as well. They're updating their sound effects. So you're going to get loads more sound effects and that introduction can happen. Loads of other cool stuff. So definitely go and check audio out. And that's me, really. That's me in a nutshell. That's Alex. That's Mr. Alex Tech. You're all caught up. The last few months have been a bit weird, a bit turbulent for me. Lots of things going on, trying to figure out exactly what I want to do. But now it finally feels like I'm on the right path and hopefully going in the right direction. I guess we'll find out. I'll document it whatever happens and we'll see what happens, I suppose. So if you've got any feedback, any thoughts, ideas, things you'd like to see, things you'd like to see more of, see less of or whatever, make sure to let me know down in the comments below. So thanks. I think I'm going to wrap this up. Much like the pizzas and my career, please keep your fingers crossed that I don't fuck this up.
