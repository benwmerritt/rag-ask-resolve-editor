What's up folks, it's Alex here, Mr. Alex Tech, and I've just discovered this super quick easy way of doing this animated rainbow gradient style text effect. Super quick and easy to do on the free version of DaVinci Resolve directly on the edit page. Now yes, there are other ways to achieve this, but this is just a real nice simple way to do it. So let's open DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you how. So here we are on the edit page of DaVinci Resolve. First things first, click on the effects library top left hand corner and then we're going to go to titles and then just grab a standard text title and drop that on your timeline just on video track number one like so. Give it a click in the inspector video title, change this to be whatever you want it to be. So I'm just going to go with Mr. Alex Tech. I'm going to get a nice chunky font or make it a bit bigger and I'm going to go with something like that. Now what you need to do still within the inspector and the video, you've got title and then settings, click on settings, comment down until you see composite and then within the composite mode, choose the dropdown and you want to make this the alpha by changing the composite mode to alpha. What we're essentially doing is turning this title into a mask. So although it looks the same, it's actually masking things out, but you won't really see that until we apply the foreground, which will then fill in that mask, which is what we're going to do now. So still within the edit page effects library once again, this time we're going to go to generators and we're going to grab the four color gradient. Just drag that on top of your text. So you've got the gradient on top with a text underneath. Initially what will happen is the four color gradient will cover up your text. Don't worry, that's expected. Give the four color gradient a click in the inspector video settings, same places before, come to composite, click the dropdown. This time you want to change this one right at the bottom to be the foreground. The text is the mask and we fill in that mask by changing the four color gradient to be the foreground and voila. So now we've got our text with our four color gradient, which looks cool. So I'm going to give this four color gradient a click inspector. This time I'm going to go to the generator tab within here. You can change the X and the Y just to move the colors around. You can change the colors of all the different corners so you can get it looking exactly as you want it. And then to animate it, still with the four color gradient selected in the inspector, go back to the settings tab. And all we're going to do is use the rotation angle to rotate the four color gradient, which gives us that animated effect. Now, as you can see, because my title is so big, we're actually cutting it off. So we're losing some of the text just above rotation angle. You've got zoom, click on this little link to unlink those. And then I can just change my Y to make this longer. And then I'll just use the rotation again. I can just double check nothing gets cut off. So we're good to go. So what we then need to do is keyframe it. So I'm going to move my playhead to the very beginning of this four color gradient. In this rotation angle, I want my degrees to be zero. So that's perfect. And then we just click this little icon, this little diamond next to the rotation angle to add a keyframe. And they're going to move my playhead to the end of the four color gradient. Within the rotation angle, we're just going to change that to be 360, or you could do 720, 1080, however much you want this to spin. And then if we just go back to the beginning and hit play, we've got this real simple, animated rainbow gradient text effect. Now, obviously, you're probably going to want to put this on top of some video footage. So just drag both of them, put them over the top of some footage like so, hit play, and you can see it works just like that. Now, if you want to resize everything to put it in a better place, a quick way of doing that highlight both the four color gradient and the text box on the timeline, right click and then turn it into a compound clip. Give it a name. I'm going to go with rainbow. And then we can just move this compound clip wherever we want it. And if we give it a click in the inspector, we can zoom it out, we can change the position, get it exactly where we want it. And then when we hit play, we've got this nice, animated color text effect thing going on. Now don't worry, that's just a compound clip. You can still get access to the text and the full color gradient if you want to simply right click, open in timeline, and then you'll get back to this point so you can give the text box a click, change any of the titles or give your full color gradient and click and change any of the colors. To get back to that original timeline, just find it within your media pool. Mine simply called timeline to double click and we're back at this point. If you want to get it back to its original form, right click, and then you're back to where you started simple. And there you go. Super simple animated text effect in no time at all. Hopefully you enjoyed this one. Let me know down below if you did. Take it easy. I'll see you next time.
