What up, folks? Alex here, and welcome to Five Minute Friday. In this video, I'm going to show you how to do a real trendy, sort of blurred, slash mirrored, edge effect that looks something like this. It's a nice little technique which you can use in music videos, B-roll, product stuff, slow motion, that sort of thing. There's plenty of nice little uses for it. Now, the tool we're going to use is called the Blanking Fill Effect. It's actually designed to just fill out the edges when your media isn't quite big enough to fit your frame. For example, if you've reported some sort of portrait, photograph, or video, it can just blur the edges and give it a nicer look. But with a few tricks, you can actually do some quite cool things with it. So, let's open up DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you what's what. Now, the first thing you need to do is open up the Effects Library, open up the Toolbox, go to Open Effects, and then we're scrolling down until you see the Resolve FX Stylized category, and it's the Blanking Fill you're looking for. So, just give it a click and drag it onto a timeline. Now, you can either apply this directly to your footage or you can use an adjustment clip. So, we're going to pop that on there. So, with that applied, click on your clip on the timeline and then open up the Inspector and then head into the Open Effects tab. And you should see Blanking Fill within here. Now, there's lots of different categories for you to play with. So, we're just going to start off with the Source. Now, from here, you can zoom in, you can zoom out, you can also crop the sides and you can crop the top and bottom. Now, by default, they're all stuck to each other, but you can just untick these tick boxes to adjust the left and the right or the top and the bottom independently. So, as you can see, what it's doing is it's cropping in from the side, leaving us with our actual footage in the middle and then created a blurred sort of replica around the edges. So, what you want to do is just set the crop to somewhere that you want to go, sort of by the edges about there, something like that. And we've got this nice sort of blurred edged border. Now, in the Fill Extend, there's Zoom Mode and you can change some of the options in there as well. So, we've got Stretch to Timeline by Default, which just means it stretches the edges, but it works quite well. We can zoom to Timeline, we can set this manually, where you can set the zoom and the aspect levels yourself, and then you've also got Warp as well. So, we're going to stick with Stretch to Timeline for now, scroll down a bit further and you've got the Fill Appearance. Now, this is where we can start to make some dramatic changes. The first one is this Blend Edges. So, at the moment, we've got this real abrupt, distinct border here. If we just adjust the blend edges, we can fade that out. And now, we've got a much nicer sort of dreamy looking blurred edge, which looks quite good, but it's actually maybe a little bit too blurred for my liking. I don't want it to look that blurrier, so I want it to be sort of in focus. So, next, change the blur background. We're just going to bring that down and we're just going to knock it. So, it's just a tiny bit out, but not too much. And now, we've got this nice looking mirrored blurred replicated border, which works really well for sort of a dream sequence or music videos and that sort of thing. Now, also, while you're in here, you've got this fade amount. So, there's no fade at the minute. There's no difference in color around the edges, but if we increase the fade amount, we can actually change the color of that border. So, we go right to the top and it'll become a harsh edge. So, we've got this white here. Under there, you've got fade color and you can change the color of that fade. Now, quick additional tip while we're in here, if we do exactly the same as we've done, but then change the basic color to black, click OK. It's a real nice way of getting sort of an old TV set style border, like so. That's not what we want for now. So, I'm just going to remove the fade amount and we've got something that looks like this, which works really well. Now, if that's not enough, what you can also do, repeat the process again. So, grab another blanking fill, drop it onto your project. In the inspector, open effects, you should now see blanking fill at the top. That's the first one we worked on, but underneath that, you should see a second blanking fill. So, if you double click, you can open this one and you can just repeat the process. So, in the second one, crop the edges in again, top and bottom. We're going to blend that, reduce the background, and now we've got three edges coming in, giving us this really cool zoomed in mirrored effect. And that's it. I hope it was useful.
