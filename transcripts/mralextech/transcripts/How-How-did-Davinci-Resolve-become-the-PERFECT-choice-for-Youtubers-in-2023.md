YouTubers, big, small, new and experienced are all jumping over to DaVinci Resolve. But why? What's changed? I don't know. Honestly. But here's the main reasons why I think Resolve has really bloomed in popularity. And a big thanks to MotionVFX for sponsoring this video. And we're going to start off talking about the one, the most obvious thing, the price. The fact that DaVinci Resolve can be downloaded right now totally for free cannot be ignored. And the free version really is solid. Yes, it does have some limitations. You can't work with certain footage like 10-bit footage. There's less effects. None of the super cool GPU effects like magic masks are included. And it does have limited GPU integration. But it's still solid. You can jump in, learn the basics and put together a really good edit with full color grading and visual effects without paying a penny. All up to Ultra HD 60 frames per second. The free version really is enough for like 90-95% of YouTubers out there. You could happily and easily run a big YouTube channel just using the free version if you wanted to. Then there's Studio, the full paid version, which is available for just £300 for a lifetime license. No subscriptions, unlimited upgrades, perfect. You can even get it for free if you buy some black magic hardware like a pocket cinema camera. With subscriptions going through the roof at the moment, paying for something just once is a bit of a game changer, which I know sounds insane. That's just how buying things should work. You should just buy a product and then you have it. That's not the way of the world at the moment. Everything is a subscription. So just being able to pay for something once is huge. Most of us YouTubers start making videos as a sideline, as a hobby, and make no money off it for the first few years at least. It took me, for example, two years before I could even turn on monetization and another few years after that before I started making anything of note, which if I was using Premiere Pro, for example, on the monthly plan would cost me about £30 a month, which is £360 a year. So it would have cost me £720 for those two years before I even turned monetization on. And that's money I simply didn't have and I know that's the same for a lot of other people, especially younger people. That makes video editing and YouTubeing in general inaccessible for a lot of potentially awesome creators. Resolve breaks down that barrier. Oh, yeah. With you like resolve, with you like black magic, it doesn't really matter. The fact that it's so accessible for everyone is huge. And I think one of the biggest reasons everyone, at the moment, or at least it feels like everyone, is jumping over. Next up, the cut page. Bear with me, hear me out. I've been spending a lot of time recently looking and thinking about the cut page. And you know what? It's a great addition to DaVinci Resolve. If you don't know, the cut page is the really simple, easy way to cut and edit within resolve. So resolve has two editing pages, cut and edit. Edit allows you to do everything, but it's kind of the old way. And it can be a little bit complicated. The cut page is really quick and really simple, but does have limitations. It's also the page that's available when you use the iPad version of DaVinci Resolve. Now I personally do tend to do most of my work on the edit page, but I'm starting to really appreciate the cut page because it's just so easy to use. Everything is easy. Everything is simple and everything is logical. You can just make your way around the cut page. And it's really easy. I actually tested this theory on my wife, who has no interest in video editing, even after all these years, has never paid any attention to what I'm doing. But I showed her both the cut page and the edit page and tried to get her up and running. And she struggled with the edit page and was picking up the basics in no time on the cut page. And that with the fact that you can download it for free, again, just makes it more accessible. It makes it easier for people to jump in and get involved. Number three, presets and add-ons. One of the things which they added in DaVinci Resolve 17.4 was DRFX files, which were a game changer. These are files which allow you to quickly create and import custom Fusion template, like titles, transitions and effects. And this was huge for the Resolve ecosystem. It's actually what I used to give out all of my 3Dbies and it's what a lot of the other DaVinci Resolve YouTubers use as well. I've put a link down in the description for any of my free stuff if you fancy checking it out. This made it much easier and much more accessible to create cool stuff, cool add-ons and whatever else. One of the biggest complaints many people have had about Resolve for the past few years is simply the fact that there isn't enough custom stuff, presets, transitions and whatever. And there still isn't, to be fair. There's not as many plugins for Resolve as there are for Final Cut or Premiere Pro or whatever. But thanks to the inclusion of those DRFX files, it's growing and it's growing fast. Just look at Motion VFX, who happened to be this video's sponsor. Up until two years ago, they only focused on Final Cut. Now they've fully embraced DaVinci Resolve. They already have 30 something really awesome plugins and they've told me that they're planning on adding at least a pack or a couple of packs every single month for the foreseeable future. They've just recently released an M Journey pack for those doing travel videos or the M Restyle pack for those that want a funkier music video kind of vibe. And literally just today, they released the M Channel Modern pack. So make sure to keep an eye on them. There's a link down in the description below. Next up, I've already mentioned it, the iPad. The inclusion of the iPad to me shows Blackmagic's commitment to making Resolve more inclusive. Big, full mainstream editors likely aren't going to do a huge amount of work on the iPad. It just doesn't make that much sense. You can use it in a professional environment to review footage or make some quick changes, but it's never going to be the main place you go to edit. If you really like portability and you're looking for something small, generally speaking, you're better off just buying a MacBook Air, for example, which is nearly as portable as the Big Fat iPad Pro, but gives you the full version of DaVinci Resolve. I think the iPad Air is there to get even more new people involved in DaVinci Resolve. For some, the iPad version is all they'll need. It'll be plenty enough to edit family videos, YouTube vlogs, or whatever else they want to edit. At the moment, it's only available for some of the higher-end iPads, but in a couple of years, those higher-end versions will just be the norm. Everyone will have a standard M-chip in that iPad Air or whatever, so they can just hop onto the App Store, download DaVinci Resolve for free, and have a really solid editor they can mess about with on their iPad for free. That is another big step into getting more and more people on to DaVinci Resolve. Also, most of MotionVFX plugins are available on the iPad too, and can be downloaded and installed via that M Installer App. And last but not least, Blackmagic themselves are changing. DaVinci Resolve has evolved a ton in the past decade. It's gone from a pretty bespoke color grading package to a massively accessible NLE that's being adopted by everyday non-professionals and professionals at a really incredible rate. For a long, long time, Blackmagic kind of ignored us YouTubers. They didn't do any social media, like none. They didn't have a Twitter or an Instagram or anything really, and there were no content creator slash online slash YouTube-focused features within Resolve. But over the past 12 to 18 months or so, this has really changed. They've made things easier. They've included those DRFX files. They've brought Resolve to a wider demographic with the iPad, and they've started implementing more social media-friendly features like vertical timelines and being able to upload directly to YouTube, even including thumbnails and chapters directly in Resolve itself. This again just helps it to become even more accessible to casual users, to beginners, and to YouTubers like me, while also not alienating the professionals as well. And as some anecdotal proof they're embracing us content creators, I was recently invited out to Prague to give a talk at a Blackmagic Trainers Summit. It was awesome, by the way, met loads of really cool people, but at the end of the day, I'm just an idiot with a YouTube channel. I'm not a professional editor, but I was invited out, I gave a talk, and they genuinely seemed to listen and be interested in my point of view. So they are starting to embrace creators like me, which is only a good thing. What will the future hold? No idea. Not a clue. But at the moment, I think they're going in a really fantastic, really interesting direction, so we'll just have to wait and see. Let me know what you think. I'd love to know your thoughts, your opinions. Pop them down in the comments section below. And that's it of my rambling. Thanks ever so much for watching. Take it easy. See you later.
