Welcome to One Minute Wednesday. Oh, hang on. Wait, wait a minute. Wait. Mr. Alex Tech, you over there. Mr. Smargy Pants, with the YouTube channel. That's One Text Box. How did you do the multiple different fonts in the One Text Box, eh? It's easy. Oh, oh, easy, is it? Well, would you care to maybe enlighten us with some of your wisdom? All right, keep your hat on. All you need to do, open up the effects library, top left hand corner, go to titles, and then grab a text effect, not a text plus. They don't work, but just the standard text, and then drop it on your timeline. Okay, for what you do with that, mind you, put it in there. Give it a click, open up the inspector, put whatever text you want in there, and then just select some of the text, so it's highlighted, and then you can use the font family and change it independently, as you need to. Well, I don't know. I don't realise it'd be that easy. Makes sense when you know it, but it's not very obvious. All right, carry on, as you were. Thank you. Wow, that was weird. She'd probably lay her photo about, I think. Ooh.
