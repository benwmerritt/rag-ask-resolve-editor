This is the Blackmagic Camera app and as of today, it is officially available for Android and you can download it completely for free. Providing you're on a particular device because it is only supported on a handful of devices which we'll come back to in a second. But this is the Blackmagic Camera app which gives you access to all of your camera controls, on-screen displays like focus peaking and false colours and access to the Blackmagic Cloud workflow, or directly from your Android device. And best of all, as mentioned, it is available completely for free! It's actually been available on iPhones for quite a while now, almost a year, I believe. But as of today, Blackmagic finally brought this over to Android as well. Currently, you can only download it if you're using a Samsung Galaxy S23, S23 Plus or S23 Ultra, or an S24, S24 Plus, which is what this is here, or an S24 Ultra, or a Google Pixel 7, 7A or 7 Pro, or a Google Pixel 8 or 8 Pro. With the Google Pixel 8a being a slightly strange omission there, don't know why that one's missing. If you try to download it from an unsupported device, like I did here with my nothing phone, it will simply show it's being not supported and it won't allow you to download it. Now I know that's going to lead to some disappointment from many of you that aren't using either the latest Google or latest Samsung phones. But overall, it is good news. Blackmagic have shown the Android side of things some love and they finally brought the app over, so those that are using those phones can get stuck in, they can mess around with the camera app, they can start using the Cloud workflow and all that sort of good stuff. Although my wife's not very happy because this is her phone and I have stolen it for a few hours. So there you go. Now I'm going to assume that this is just the initial rollout. So this is the start of the Blackmagic camera app and it will eventually trickle out to other devices and other manufacturers in the future. I don't know anything for certain. I don't know if that's going to happen and I certainly don't know when that's going to happen. I have no additional information outside of what Blackmagic have shared on their social media pages today. Fingers crossed that does happen. As to why this is the case, we can only kind of hypothesize, speculate, guess why this may be. We all know the Android ecosystem is far more diverse than the iPhone's ecosystem. For example, there's different manufacturers using different variants of the US on different hardware and they probably make different APIs available. Some are probably really open with that sort of thing. Others are maybe really closed off with that sort of thing. We don't really know. So maybe there's some limitations there, or maybe it's simply a time issue. This is a free app, for example, so they're not going to throw tons and tons of resources and money at this thing, trying to get it to work on every single device from day one. It may be that they simply ran the numbers so that these Pixel and Samsung devices are the most popular. So they made it work on those initially, and then they'll spend some time trickling out to other manufacturers in the future. That would kind of make sense. I don't know. Only time will tell really, we're just going to have to wait and see. As mentioned, this is a V1. It's only been available for a few hours today. Literally launched this morning. I saw it when I first woke up. I've had a quick play with it and I am happy to report it's good. It has lots of the features from the Apple version. There are a few things missing as of today, but hopefully some of those will come in the future. So let's have a real quick rundown of what's here and what's not. First up, starting off with format and color spaces. One of the big benefits of the iPhone version is that it shoots in ProRes and of course you get access to Apple log if you're using one of the latest and greatest iPhones. None of that sort of thing is available on the Android version. We have H.264 and HEVC, which is H.265 and that's available in Rec. 709, Rec. 2020, HLG10 and HDR10. As of right now, they are your only options. Of course, we'd love to see more options here. Maybe some of the log format, maybe even some black magic raw. Maybe, I don't know. We'll just have to wait and see once again. On a similar note, LUTs do seem to be missing currently. There's no way to add any of your own LUTs from the menu. It's actually missing from the menu system entirely. Resolutions and frame rate will of course depend on your device. On this S24+, I have resolutions all the way up to 8K and the frame rates go all the way up to 60. Quick note on those, there's no 23.976 or 29.97. It's all 24, 25, 30, 50 or 60. The UI though is basically identical. It's the very simple, really nice to use and very recognizable black magic UI, which you'll be very familiar with if you've used any of that pocket cameras or that video assists or anything like that in the past. It's nice, it's simple, it looks good and it is genuinely really quite easy to use. You've also got lots of on-screen displays to make your life easier. Things like audio monitoring, false colors, histograms. You can switch it over to use shutter angles rather than shutter speed, which is handy. There's focus peaking, there's frame guides and you can do all of that whether you're shooting horizontally or in portrait mode. Because this does shoot portrait video if that's what you're into, but they've also included the feature where you can hold your phone in portrait orientation but actually be shooting landscape video. Now, we'll do that by actually punching into the sensor so you will lose resolution, you will be cropping in, but in a pinch if you need to run around like this and take horizontal video, you can. There's also quick access to all of your different lenses, depending again on your device. This one's got three, so I can really quickly switch between the lenses, aka the focal lens, as required. There's stabilization options, there's exposure controls, there's manual focus or you can use touch to focus. There's those built-in time codes I mentioned which allows you to actually sync your clips together from multiple different devices for multi-cams using that timecode which is pretty handy. At the moment, it all seems to record either directly to the internal storage or you can use the Blackmagic cloud which we'll talk about in a second. I did plug in an external SSD but it didn't seem to pick it up, so that definitely does work on the iPhone so hopefully that will come in a future update. Now, talking of that cloud workflow, pretty much all of that does seem to be here from day one which is pretty cool. I actually think that's probably one of the main features, one of the main selling points of this app. There are other really good camera apps available for Android at the moment which just give you access to frame rates and shutter angles and all that sort of stuff. The really unique thing about this camera app is the ability to automatically sync everything that you shoot with the app directly to the cloud so that people can open up DaVinci Resolve kind of from anywhere and they will automatically get the proxies even while you're still out shooting and can start cutting and editing things together. It's really quite cool. All you do within DaVinci Resolve, you create a new cloud project and you allow the remote camera access. Once that's done, from within the app, you just select that same project. Then you can choose whether to sync the proxies or the proxies and the camera originals. Then by default, whenever you finish recording anything, the phone will automatically create the proxies for you and upload them directly to the project. So even if you've got that project open, the files will automatically come in to the media pool. You can just drop them on your timeline and start editing away. It's all pretty seamless. You can disable that auto upload option if you prefer and then you simply need to select the files from kind of the media page on the app. Select the ones you want to upload. It will create the proxies and upload them as you go. Then you can just grab the camera originals from your phone, re-link those clips and you're good to go. There's also the chat feature here too. So if someone does have the same project open on the actual full blown DaVinci Resolve on a PC, Mac or whatever, you can have a little chat with them while you're out and about. It's all pretty neat. It's all pretty cool. Now if you'd like to know more about the Blackmagic Camera app, just in general, how people are integrating it into their workflow, just have a look on YouTube. There's tons of really great videos, mostly talking about the iPhone version of course, but everything pretty much will be the same in terms of workflow when using this new Android version. So go take a look at those and let me know what you think. I do appreciate some of you are going to be a bit upset, a bit disappointed that it's not available on your device, but hopefully that will all come in the future. Let me know your thoughts and feedback down below. Thanks for watching. Take it easy. I'll see you next time.
