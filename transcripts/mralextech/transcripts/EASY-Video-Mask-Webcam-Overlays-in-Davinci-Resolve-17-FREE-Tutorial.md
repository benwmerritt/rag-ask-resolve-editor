What up folks, Alex here, Mr. Alex Tech. Welcome to this 5 minute Friday video. And in this one, I'm going to show you how to use pretty much any shape you like as a cutout for your gaming, webcam or picture in picture footage like I'm doing right here. It's super quick, super easy. I'm going to do it from directly within the edit tab of DaVinci Resolve 17. You do need to be on DaVinci Resolve 17 to use this method. Now you will also need a PNG file of the shape that you want. To help get you started, I've actually created a bunch of basic examples which you can download for free from the link down in the description below. Or you can just head to Google type the shape you want followed by PNG and generally that pretty easy to find. So with that out of the way, let's jump into DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you what's what. So here we are within DaVinci Resolve and we're on the edit tab. So I've imported my basic shapes, as you can see in my media poll here. And we've got the other footage in there ready to go as well. Now I'm going to assume that you want your gaming footage or whatever footage it is down here on Video Track 1. So we're going to put our webcam footage above using Video Tracks 2 and 3. So the first thing we want to do is just to grab our shape. So I'm just going to go with this hexagon. And we're going to bring this down onto Video Track 2 and then just release. Then we just need to drag it to be as long or as short as we need it to be. Then we're going to grab our webcam footage or our picture in picture, which for me is this one here. And we're going to drag this down onto Video Track 3. Now what you need to do is to click on your Video Track on Video Track 3 like so. So it's highlighted in red. Open up the inspector top right hand corner. Come down to composite. Click on the word composite if you don't see the composite modes underneath like so. And then click on normal. Scroll down and change that to be foreground. It will look like nothing's changed, but don't worry. Come down to your shape underneath on Video Track 2. Same thing, click it so it's highlighted in red. Open up the inspector once again, composite, composite mode and then change that to be alpha. And tada, it will automatically do that cut for you. Our webcam footage will be in the middle and these black areas on the left and right are actually transparent. So if I put some footage underneath, you can see that we have our cutout and it's all done and ready to go. Now what I like to do here is to just rearrange things, do some transforms to make sure that everything lines up as you want it. So I'm going to give my video footage at the top a click. I'm going to click on this little transform. No, just underneath the preview window like so. And then I can just transform this. I can zoom in, zoom out, get it looking as I want it. So I'm going to go with something like that. And then once I'm happy with both the size of the shape itself and the footage within, highlight them both on the timeline just by clicking and dragging. So they're both highlighted in red, right click and then choose new compound clip, give it a name and then click create. And that will just bundle those two bits of footage together like so. Then it's much easier to resize and put it in the right location. So again, we're going to give that compound clip a click using the transform, we can just make this smaller, put it up in the corner like so. And then if we hit play, we've got a real simple picture in picture with a shape like so, dead quick and dead easy. Now if you want to change the shape or make any changes to it, don't worry, it's dead easy to do. On the compound clip on the timeline, just right click, click on decompose in place. And that will revert it back to its original form. So we've got our shape and our video above there. So I'm just going to delete this hexagon. This time let's grab the button. We'll lengthen this out, we'll give it a click, we'll change the composite mode to alpha. And there we go. We'll highlight them both, turn them into a compound clip once again. And then we can resize and put it wherever we want. And there you go. It's as easy as that. That's how to use basic shape PNGs to do webcam masks on the edit page, but then to reach resolve.
