Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Whatever you call it. Whatever you've been doing. I hope you've really well And I hope you've had a wonderful few days Me and Casey recorded a podcast just before Christmas. So here it is I was gonna try and rush it out and get it ready for Christmas Day But I decided to just take a break and not do much of anything at all. So here it is now for you instead We had a really nice fun long silly conversation about Christmas stuff We argue about pies versus tarts Gravy Yorkshire puddings all that sort of stuff. I apparently completely forgot that apple pies exist and lemon meringue pies That will all make sense in a moment I also swap and change between referring to myself as English and British which may annoy some of you So I apologize for that and then we also talk about some of our favorite Christmas movies It's a whole lot of fun. We both kind of lose our minds here and there. So it's really good I really enjoyed this one. So I hope you guys enjoy it There will be some more DaVinci Resolve content coming on the channel very soon and in the new year We're gonna get back to business as usual. So once again, thanks ever so much for sticking around. Thanks for being on the channel Thanks for watching these podcasts and all the other videos and everything else that I do So hopefully you enjoy this one and I'll catch up with you all again very soon enjoy Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas This is Christmasy, right? It will it will do it'll do it'll do that's one way to start a podcast Hello everyone Merry Christmas Merry Christmas Christmas time is here I'm slightly disappointed you're not wearing a Christmas jumper Casey. I don't even know what a jumper is. Why's got dogs on? You win I like I'm not even festive at all. It's Christmas special. We're not even gonna mention resolve. It's just Christmas No, we should we should what's one? Present that you can give the listeners the watchers viewers that is a resolve tip for Christmas What's what's your Christmas tip present? Does it have to be Christmas related? No, it's just it just it's just nice nice to know Nice to know yeah The timeline backups this is incredibly dry and boring I want it. I want even more dry and boring. Oh No, I'm going with time time line backers right click on the timeline within your media board You can get backups because they introduced it a few versions ago So if you've messed up your timeline you can go back to an old version see I knew that but I never use that see I forget It's there and then I remember and go oh, yeah I can go back to and when you restore it it restores a The backup, but you've now got a new timeline today. You've got two timelines. You can go this is the one I think I messed up. This is the old one actually I didn't mess up. I prefer the new one I'm gonna sleep with that one. Well, that's a nice present that we can unwrap from under the tree Shall we hang on that? You've got to deliver yours now. Okay. Let's see what this is. Let's open open up that oh Wow Learn color management You should learn that it's really important if you've been ignoring it don't ignore it anymore It's it's really really important. Okay. I have videos on that Colin has videos on that It's it's kind of intimidating, but it's really really worth the Investment of time and energy. So there's a free gift for you good gift. That's the gift And if you don't like that gift keep hold of the receipt and you can return it within 28 days Yep, unless let's Santa brought it. I got another question for you Let's flip it around and keep it slightly topical. Oh, no if you had a let's go with a $100 budget. Yes, and you were buying gift for a fellow resolve user that had nothing What would you buy them? What would you be your this right here? It's exactly what I was looking at This right here I would pick a very nice weighted mouse with a scroll wheel that you can push down Yes, that is the ultimate tool for resolve and ideally with some side clicky buttons Yep, just make life a little bit easier got a little sniper button here In in case there's some snooping that needs to happen. Is that what you would say to you? Yeah I was literally thinking mouse because just makes life so much easier when you've got a good mouse a good keyboard as well But you kill keepers are kind of the same generally unless you give something really bespoke But the difference between like I have a relatively basic mouse and then a good mouse It does just a world of good whether you're on the edit page with you on the color page whether you're in fusion It just makes your life so much easier. Yep. I totally agree. Yep invest in a good mouse That's the way so that's the obligatory resolve talk out the way. Okay now we get to the real deal Candy Canes are you for them? Oh, yeah all day regular canikines or the fancy ones So I'll go for the cheapest big bag of minty candy Canes just pure Garbage and and I want it to taste like I'm brushing my teeth That's what I just want to feel like I've got a fresh minty mouth the entire day. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's that's a big deal What about eggnog? Eggnog I'm for it. Oh, I am very for it. It's not a big thing. So I did some very dull research earlier Eggnog comes from England. Oh, but we don't really it's not popular over here. So we Made it and they were just like enjoy everyone. Yeah America have this Yeah, I have tried it actually and I'm enjoying it, but I don't I don't ever woke up and you know what I fancy Nog dude, that's me like every morning in December. I Literally was thinking about that this morning like hmm. Should I do my protein shake or should I just drink a bunch of eggnog? Oh eggnog protein shake. Yeah. No, that's a good time. Yeah, that's that's real good. I was looking for some Generic Christmas related questions like a quizzes and still okay They got really deep into like Christmas law on. Oh, yeah, this is way too much So I picked a handful of really loose questions, which I'm just gonna throw at you for fun. Okay. All right Which popular Christmas beverage is also called milk punch? Well, is that eggnog? It's eggnog. Yeah, all right, yeah In which James Bond film is there a character called Dr. Christmas Jones Dr. Christmas Jones? Oh, yes, that would be a no time to die. I Literally don't know Dude, are you literally drinking Guinness right now? Yeah, but it's like the evening for you, right? Oh, yeah It's half-five. Okay. It's 9 30 a.m. For me. I was like, oh, okay. We're serious Really Christmasy the answer by the way the world is not enough from 1999 There you go. See you okay. All right, which former president of the United States has a cameo in Home Alone 2 you'll know this one Yeah, that's um That's a Trump mr. Trump. Yeah True or false mince pies in our original form contained meat. I'm gonna say false. Oh True apparently. Oh A mince pie is a big thing over there. No, no, like I literally could not tell you what's an immense pie other than it's My guess is that it's like ground beef and cabbage No, I Don't know I really don't know that like I don't eat them So I get Scalded as a British man because I don't eat mince pies really I'm not a big fan But that like fruits, you know that really sweet fruits minced like saltanas and now all that sort of stuff Loaf, you know, like meatloaf the bread kind of the sweet bread. Yeah, it's like that kind of inner pastry kind of Okay, I don't yeah, I don't I don't even really have a concept of that So confused now, okay, let me Google exactly what I just lost Okay, mince pie is what it's called a mince pie. Yeah, like am I in CE? Yeah. Oh wow like I've Okay, no joke. I have never ever seen this Really? This is the first thing that looks like this that I've seen. Oh Like I don't even what is It's not often that you see like a food you've just never seen I Made out of it looks to me like it's like biscuit It's a tiny biscuit bowl with raisins in it and then a snowflake on top. Yeah, pretty much This sentence makes no sense. And I think you'll agree with me on this Mince meat, uh-huh is made with a mixture of dried fruit such as raisins currents candy fruit meal peels lemon and orange zest finely chopped apple brandy and warmed spices This sounds like an English person thing let's make something and call it something completely different wouldn't that be nice? All right chaps Okay, chaps. You know like eggnog is for you guys like it's this quintessentially. Yeah, Christmasy thing mince pies Really? Yeah Some of them sort of look like tiny bigger pies which we have pies Do you guys have pies? Oh? Yeah, this gets oh this is gonna make the British people sound worse Oh my god, do you not have pies no wait so the only pie Hang on there we go this right so what you think of pies like a dessert. Yeah The only dessert kind of pie we call a pie is a mince pie whereas it cuz otherwise what do you call a pie? Like a tart even if it's big like you'd have like an apple tart. Yeah, like okay, so like a big a big Well, I call it a pie plate, but you know it's like a pan with bread and Then the inside of it is sweet Fruit and then it sometimes has crumbles on top and it's like it's like this big That's a tart. What is wrong with English people? I Now I'm saying it out loud I Agree with you guys because a mince pie isn't from our definition isn't a pie because if you went into a shop And you asked for a pie they'd give you like a steak pie or a you know a chicken pie And it's is it that big though now like a steak pie would be like Yeah, big and It'd be full of like gravy even gravy means something different Like a mean gravy super weird over there, right? No, your grave is weird. I will argue that your grave is weird Okay, I Okay, so for over here if you had a tart it would not be bigger than this it can't be It's a cookie basically. It's like a cookie with stuff on top. That's a tart No, it's like we can have a tart that's a full-size thing. Wow Yeah, that just violates all rules All of them all the rules That's against all the rules mince pies just shouldn't be called mince or pie. The name is entirely wrong. It's just stupid Yeah, it is agree. Yeah, okay, so what we would call these what what you what you call mince pie We would probably call Probably a tart in in a twist of irony It's heart. What would you call the innards pie filling? It makes no sense I don't know what what do you call you call it mince, right? No, not usually in the in a mince pie. Yes, but in anything else. No, we'd call it same filling Okay, well you fill it with jam or but jelly is different jelly's like Jello for you guys. Yes, so we call So your jam now our jam is your jelly jelly But your Jello is our jelly then what's our jelly jam But jam and jelly are different. So what's the difference between jelly and jam? Okay, so jelly is The same thing is jam, but without the seeds. Oh, we just call it seedless jam That makes sense And you can literally you can go to buy jam and they'll be like seated jam or seedless jam kind of like smooth or Granted peanut butter. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Wow I'm learning so much about cultures here. Yeah, this is not where I saw our conversation go Okay, back to Christmas back to Christmas. Sorry. I am I've got more in questions though What do you guys eat for Christmas dinner? This may be a stupid question. This may be obvious Do you guys do the full load? Okay, so Christmas dinner an American Christmas dinner Would typically be either a turkey or a ham mashed potatoes American gravy and probably Probably like pumpkin pie or apple pie probably something like that Yeah So what's American I thought gravy was something out of breakfast there is but Americans have all kinds of gravy. We love gravy because you have sausage gravy, right? That was the sausage gravy is like yeah breakfast gravy the white slushy stuff people putting on the plate. Yes Yeah, that that goes on biscuits, which you call Not biscuits This whole thing is just an exercise in translation Biscuits and gravy for Americans are like rolls that are fluffier and flipperier That you eat for breakfast with sausage be on top. So your biscuits are like scones scones. Yeah scone. Yeah, pretty much Yeah, yeah super weird that you eat them like if I went into Anyone's house and said I've brought some scones. Let's put some sausage juice on them. I'd be thrown out dude That sounds good to me. I Mean if they were like blueberry scones or something you wouldn't but if they're like Like with either like cheese or if it's just like butter Yeah, see we would have scones like with cream and jam. Yeah, I mean we would too. We also have that But there's also biscuits and gravy. It's more like okay. Imagine you are overalls every day All right, and you go to work at the wood mill, right? Where you where you tip you cut down trees and you turn them into lumber You eat biscuits and gravy for a breakfast From from the convenience store That's how America works It's the the spittin' sawdust kind of grub like if you need you want just basic tasty fuel for the day That's you go to Yes. Yeah, okay. I'm fine So I'm gonna name two things now We still have some obscure names. You may already know them. You may not two things that we eat Christmas dinner Yorkshire pudding Have you ever Yorkshire pudding? I don't know if I could tell you exactly what it is. Is that like bread pudding? No, so imagine it's essentially pancake batter So like you're making pancakes, uh-huh, but you put it in the oven and it gets all nice and fluffy And you don't have any sugar to it so it's kind of like a savory pancake but it puffs up into a Round little almost scone like kind of looking thing maybe okay, and then people usually have that with their dinner She put a bit of gravy on it meaty gravy and you have it with your veg and your potatoes. They're nice So it's biscuits and gravy No, the same thing now it looks different It's just a big biscuit Now it's it's got a very different Did you know that pancakes and the things that we make biscuits from biscuits and gravy are of That's the same mix the same stuff. They are very similar actually now. I've said it out loud Now I just still disagree Our principle Stop breathable out of that thing and the next one pigs in blankets okay over here That is little baby hot dogs wrapped in um What would they be like instant croissant things like Like the pillsberry things. Yeah, that would be pigs in blankets probably same thing. They might be sausage Yeah, it's definitely sausage. Okay, and we wrap them in bacon. Oh see that sounds awesome. Yeah, that sounds way better It's for some reason they're really great and again We only eat them once a year, but you just take sometimes they're little sausage here sometimes people just go for like a full size Big sausage and just wrap it in like six rashes of bacon. Dude, that sounds awesome. I want to do that Yeah, google it. They look as good as they sound. They're amazing dude. I'm gonna make that Do that. Yeah, it's it's not a complicated thing to make Oh, yeah, so okay so google Pigs in a blanket. Yeah, well, they look nice as well and actually I did have one of them I sampled one of those when I was over in your your world And they're nice, but I prefer oh, yeah, but they're different for sure different. Yeah, yeah the sausage with bacon around it sounds way better That sounds awesome. Yeah, I want that I highly recommend pigs in blankets So good. I think we can get back on track now. I think that's all my questions Okay, well, I have a question for you. Okay, so Christmas tradition and stuff went okay I'm just now forgive me. Okay, but I've already just been through the ringer With the the pies and tarts thing. All right, but do you guys open presents on Christmas? Like do you do you do Christmas presents? Yeah, okay I mean we are British, but we we're not like cavemen Do you guys have presents? You guys do get like that's a thing You have people there There's there's different people do different things so I've I've always been brought up as like You get up really early You have a cup of tea you could you know put the kettle on and then you just sit down and you open your presents And not your Christmas morning Becky my wife actually they didn't open presents till after Dinner after lunch So they would maybe exchange a few little gifts in the morning And then they'll have a nice family sort of gathering and just relax together And then they'll have that main meal of the day and then they'd open gifts So it does differ around the uk But I was I just brought up like you get up in the morning Have a cup of tea and a biscuit go wild open all your presents Yeah, that's that's how I was raised also is like first thing in the morning Like that's that's what happens, right? My wife they opened Christmas presents on uh Christmas eve And I'm like, but how are you supposed to do that because santa didn't bring the presents yet? Yeah, so this breaks down immediately like what's what's that about? Yeah, how do they explain that? They I don't know I I don't know as what do they do on Christmas day then? Exactly, what do you got going on? I mean, I guess they play with their toys and stuff they got but still it's like I don't know it seems like the the magic of Christmas eve is waiting for your presents the next morning It's waiting for santa to come, right? And well, it's called Christmas eve. It's the eve of Christmas If it wasn't if you meant to open your presents that day that day would just be called Christmas Yeah, right. I know I know I've explained how wrong my wife is to my wife, but she doesn't listen Yeah Well, I'm gonna write a sternly worded email. I think you should mrs. Faris. Yeah Well, I when we got married I was like listen this stops now Like raise our children to believe well What do you call the day after christmas day? Uh boxing day. Oh, yeah. No, that is the same. I know you guys do We don't do anything the day after christmas. It's the magic is completely gone. Oh, that's interesting Yeah, we cancel all the magic about four o'clock christmas day. That's Do all the shops open and stuff on boxing day well the day after christmas. I mean, yeah, they're open Usually they're open a lot of them are open on christmas. Oh really depends. Yeah No, I could have country generally pretty much shuts down bar You know, you can order some food if you want to get takeout and that sort of thing but most places Yeah, it's all shut down from this year. It'll be from friday There'll be a couple of days some of the shops open and we'll still be open on christmas eve for like some late Shopping but then it just closes and everything's shut now our stuff closes like slightly early christmas eve and then opens late on Christmas it depends like a lot of places are closed but the places that are open will do that kind of thing like the major grocery stores and stuff will Do that? Hmm. What's the name of the family dog in the simpsons adopted on christmas eve? Santa's little helper Hey, I know that I I know a surprising amount of simpsons trivia. I don't know if if that's a Widely known thing, but I was very into the simpsons growing up and so Until they started going downhill and watched like probably every episode several times Oh, I mean that was the only bit of Simpsons related to christmas questions. I had unfortunately maybe next time i'll bring some Simpsons trivia just to entertain the folks at home. That'd be that'd be a good time. I I uh I pride myself in knowing very obscure simpsons things From pretty much watching only that growing up I mean it was the best thing to watch growing up to be fair. Yes. Yes. It was. Yes. It was well, um, what is a What is a christmas wish that you have? for I guess going into the new year and And actually let's do this. Let's say let's say this. I would love to know The the highlights from this year and um, and then and then maybe maybe a couple christmas wishes for next year wishes cool whip Highlights of the year. Well, obviously this has actually been my my first year as a as a full time youtuber Man, how has that been? Interesting. It's been an interesting year. Good overall really good It was a big step for me to to take, you know, moving away from full-time employment where I was Nice and cushy and I had annual leave and Insurance and all that sort of stuff. That was really nice. I gave all that up But it's it's given me so much freedom to do my own thing I've been able to work on some other stuff and take some opportunities which wouldn't have arisen before and Being my only boss is he's awesome next year Same thing we're gonna keep keep doing it and keep trying to be whatever I am One of the weird youtube people So we're gonna keep doing that. But yeah, it's gone really well. Obviously I don't want to talk about it every episode, but it got the the magic anime out. That was a big thing being Yeah, do my own thing allowed me the time to make that and I've been working on all the other stuff That's coming out very soon as well Starting podcast with you. This has been fun. It's been a bit of a highlight Traveling done again all because of the other stuff. I've been able I went to nab in april first time in vegas That was really cool. Yeah came out to see you guys for his old car That was super cool. Obviously we came the year before as well, but last year we came been really good. Yeah That's my year in summary. Essentially. I learned about pies and tarts. Yeah Changed my world. Yeah Complete world world melter. Yeah, and then next year More of the same essentially I'm trying to To keep going with the the magic stuff. Obviously we've got some plans which hopefully we'll be able to share with the world soon And I've got some ideas for some things I wanted to start reaching out to some other other creators and start giving those More of a platform that's kind of one of my big big things for next year I've started putting some things in place for that. So Yeah, keep keep doing what I'm doing Try and really find the groove to make my youtube videos a bit more consistent because I've been a bit all over the place with those But that's the plan that's kind of the big plan for next year really. Well, it's that's awesome, man It's it's inspiring to see you, you know jumping in and doing the full-time thing and releasing magic anime and Yeah, putting out the videos and stuff and man, it's just been Been so good. You're making such cool stuff and I'm thank you so excited excited for all of that Thank you. What about you? What's your your your highlights of the year and your plans for the next one? Yeah highlights of the year big thing as far as yeah, um business and youtube and the side of things has been has just been uh putting out the fusion course and really kind of double down doubling down on fusion and um Really concentrating on how to teach people fusion the best and how to focus on that well and uh, that's been just So rewarding in so many ways so good um seeing people Go from not really knowing much and kind of being frustrated and scared of fusion to being able to make their own stuff and I mean it's just been so neat and um been loving that yeah, just trying to refine everything this year and make everything run a little smoother and stuff and we're kind of finishing some of that stuff up here in the next Next few weeks. I'm going to be launching a new version of our website and um getting that kind of really refined to be easy to go and um Look at the courses and get stuff and download things and get to things a lot easier and have it a lot more well organized We've learned a lot about focus and that kind of thing this year and it's been really really great And uh this next year. I think it's going to be a lot of we want to give really well We want to um make really high value videos and I don't know how to say it. I think just give way more than we are right now as far as value and um, I just I want people to Look at things that we make and go dang man. Like that is just So useful and so helpful And now I can do new stuff. Do you do that? Anyway, that's the The base of your channel is what you've done for so well for so long. So I'm interested to see how you can Take that even further and I will be sitting here taking notes What can I steal of kasey? Yeah, man. Well, okay, the thing is though we'll talk for a second like if everyone had that um mindset then The internet would be a very nice place You know if everyone was just focused on how do I help people the very best? We have such a good time Yeah, we would and I think we had the conversation in a One of our previous episodes talking about youtube, but it's like it's one of the best ways to to succeed online Is generate stuff that helps people Yeah And even if you're doing it for Not saying you should but even if you're doing it for selfish reasons as long as people are still being helped out Yeah, you will do well and then people go away happy. It's one of the best things you can do Yeah, it's really hard to lose when you're when you have service in mind Right like when you're thinking about how can I make other people's lives better and enrich other people? um make things easier for them like Worst case you do an okay job at that and it helps people and it still feels good Yeah, like you know And you can tack the other stuff on Kind of afterwards, but the focus should be this is gonna help x y and z and then afterwards you go Okay, how can I maybe monetize this later on or whatever? It's the it should always be that way around Yep, so it's going to be a big focus on that in the next year. Um, we're excited about Things that I can't can't talk a lot about like resolve con stuff, but that is definitely in the in the um The plans of doing something with that, but we have to figure out what all that means and it might might be different ish We'll see resolve. It's always a good time. It's always a good time. Yeah, whatever we do is going to be great Uh, but we're just trying to figure out what that is If you message me and said we're all gonna meet up in a car park and eat pie I'd be like right give me the dates and I will be like pie you mean a pie or a tart Is there gonna be gravy? I hope so It certainly hopes so I am hungry now actually same same How long have we got how much time have we got the original plan for this podcast? Because we're going to talk about our favorite christmas movies and we've talked more about tarts and pies than anything else that's Basically the same as watching a movie is eating a pie. I mean, it's arguably better Maybe would you rather watch a good movie or eat a good pie? I think I think the only answer is both the only answer Okay, so top christmas movies then Yes, what say we do a countdown of your top five christmas movies was started with the fifth the fifth one And then we'll end with the first one and we're gonna have a battle on who has who thinks their movie is better Yeah, I'm actually is a confession not the world's biggest christmas movie fan Like there's a few that I like and I've listed them becky watches a lot of like these hallmark All christmas movies. I think they they scarred me. Yeah So I'm but she watches those in like the summer she goes on the christmas channel and she's just got this nonsense on But anyway, my number five This is an old one and I remember enjoying it as a youth and I haven't watched it in a long time So this may be a horrible pick But okay, it is jingle all the way starring all the way. I'm fortunate. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good time Yeah, we turn away man. Yeah I I remember enjoying it and I haven't watched it in so long. I can't even really tell you much about it but I remember really enjoying it and It's got an old in it. It's a christmas movie with an old being like hey, I want the turbo man And it's yeah, that's pretty good. I don't need fresh and I can do it. Yeah. Yeah. No, that was a good time That was a good time. I watched that last year actually it was What's your number five number five? Oh Number five I think Oh, it's so hard to pick see that's the thing is I'm like I kind of know what like my first and second one But like this this level Drumroll, I think I'm gonna go with no, well Have you seen no, well No It's on Disney or Netflix or something. It's it's relatively new. It's the last couple years, but it has uh That one girl that looks like every other girl And now is it down? Yeah, but Anna Kendrick and bill hater Such a great movie so much fun It's the spirit of like elf. All right, but it's I don't know. I don't know. It's charming. It's well shot. It's everything is great. It's funny You just why you're mad? I don't think I've even heard of that. So I'm gonna add it to my list Yeah, it's on uh, Disney plus because and I like both of those people you can't really go wrong with either Those the both three no, no you cannot I have a joke for you, which you've reminded me of okay. I'm ready What's the difference between the regular alphabet and the christmas alphabet? Christmas alphabet has no well Ha Got them. All right number four number four This is a relatively new one And it's not a usual standard christmas movie, but I really enjoyed it and sometimes you need to watch something a little bit violent So I've added number four violent night violent night I have not seen this one, but I've heard it's great. Yeah, I really enjoyed it. It's got david harbour in it It's about a real life santa claus Then there's a family that have been been taken hostage in their own home by these baddies And santa claus is having his little bit worse for wear a bit of an alcoholic not in a good state And he says no i'm gonna sort these guys out So he beats them all up and it's basically john wick but john wick is santa claus And it's it's great and it's violent and it's silly And you just turn it on and turn your brain off and go this is I'm enjoying this. This is great. I know exactly what's going to happen If not the entire film as soon as you start watching it. Yeah, it's all the better for it All right, I love that Okay, um for me number four would be urnist saves christmas Oh, you're really pulling them out of the bag, aren't you? I'm pulling them out of the bag. Is that a saying over there? Uh, maybe I don't even recognize that I don't think of Okay, do you know the urnist movies though, right like urnist peawarl? E No, okay. Um It's really dumb. It's really dumb It's this guy who's kind of a loser that always tries his best and he just fumbles through everything It's played by jim varney You know jim varney is is the voice of slinky dog in toy story Oh, yes, I know his face and I've clicked on him. I know yeah. Yeah. So anyway, it's it's the classic story of santa can't deliver the presence and so This guy who isn't very good at stuff has to deliver the presence and it's just It's just great. It's wonderful And it's heartwarming and it's it's fun So yeah, that's that's a big one for me urnist urnist saves christmas noted I'm writing all these down there. I may by the way my favorite halloween movie is urnist scared stupid Oh, so he does fully seasonal. Oh, yeah, he does all there. There's like 20 movies or something. Are they all good? No, there's like the major releases. There's like five major releases and like six or seven like terrible ones Got the major ones are good. Yeah. So some go to cinema and some go and go straight to dvd. That kind of thing It's like that. Yeah. Okay. Okay. My number three This is a controversial one people always argue about this, but I have to mention it die hard die hard Is die hard a christmas movie in your opinion? Honestly, I've not seen die hard I know ever ever I really haven't I really haven't seen it Okay, well, I'm I'm putting to you that you need to sit down this christmas and watch die hard That's what I hear. I just haven't I haven't got to haven't got to it. There's a lot of movies if you describe a Man he happens to be a policeman He goes to visit his family on christmas day And then he gets into all sorts of trouble And some mishaps happen And then he learns that his family is the most important thing Sounds like a christmas movie to me. It's christmas movie, right? Yeah, this happens to be terrorists and Stuff involved as well, but it's a christmas movie. I really like it. You know, it's a it's a classic You can't really go wrong. Can you know what's your number three? number three elf Elf elf is my number two Oh, see Yeah, I it you know, it could be one of the top three. I would say elf is just it's hard to beat elf It's it's just a good time, isn't it like it's it's so silly and it's so funny and it's will ferrell kind of it Is best in my opinion. Yeah And yep, it's just dumb and every time I watch it I go I kind of want to try spaghetti with maple syrup on it. It kind of looks disgusting but kind of nice Yes, exactly. Oh, that's a good time. So we need your number two next my number two is home alone two Controversial so you prefer home alone two to home alone. It's better. Oh I don't prefer it. It's just better Just better. This is facts. Okay. She's facts. It's facts. Home alone two. I think home alone two just gets a little bit Just a little edge on it. Yeah, I do like the pigeon lady Pigeon lady. It's a good time I like when he's throwing the bricks off the roof and hits the guy in the head with the bricks Oh, yeah, I just think there's something about the first one. I just think it's there's more of um I don't know. There's a charm to the first one. Yeah, it's it makes a little more sense Yeah, it's a little more believable, but oh well, I'd now I haven't seen two in a while We watch the first one most years, you know, we bought home alone on so that may be just be like a Affirmity thing rather than me preferring it. Home alone is my number one So so I went with the first home alone as As my number one pick because it's one that we watch all the time. It's great. That's so cool I learned the other day the the mom in home alone the character Is in home alone. She's meant to be 30. I think she's 35 years old And I was like I watched it every year and still look at her as like a mom I'm like, oh, no, I am that she has to be that that's what's so weird about like getting older is is People that are my age that are in older movies look older than I do Yeah, they do or at least we perceive them to be it's like they always just like yeah, that's that's a mom like I I'm never going to be that old No, but there might be young people watching this podcast going like the two parents from home alone are having a podcast Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I like I think of like my friend's mom growing up Right and I'm like She looks like a mom Yeah, and I look at like my kid's friends moms and I was like They are way too young to look like a mom Yeah, I totally agree But I don't the people always say you never feel your age and I guess as a kid you like you must do I I will feel like an adult when I'm an adult, but actually I'm totally right. You never do That's not man. Okay. So my number one Christmas movie now this Is going to ruffle a feather or two or is this some Curveball coming out now. It's not it's just it's a newer movie and it and it's beating a home alone in elf and everything on my opinion All right, Christmas Chronicles. It's like pretty it's the last few years. They made it um, it's Couple of kids They stay up and try and catch Santa Claus Mm-hmm and they end up getting him on video and they go outside and Santa's in another uh In another house and they climb in his sleigh And he accidentally takes them up to the north pole and or he's on the way to the north pole and they end up crashing And they have to help Santa deliver the presents and everything. It's the same thing, right? But it's just super well done And everything about it is great. There's an awesome car chase Like a police chase in it like with a dodge challenger and it's just It's so good. This is the one with Kurt Russell Yes, okay. Yeah, I mean that that sounds good. It's great, man It's just it's just a solid movie my kids love it too. It's like their favorite also You can't argue with it. I mean how great of a Santa does Kurt Russell make? I'm just looking at the Screen grabs. He's a great Santa. Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah, it's awesome noted I mean, I have no opinion. I've never seen it. I didn't really know anything about it. So I'll watch that I will watch that over the Christmas period and so and then we can We should do a follow-up and we can report back and I'll take my opinion of Christmas chronicles and you can tell me your opinion of diehard. Yeah, that sounds great. Let's do it Let's do I have some I have some uh some honorable mention Christmas movies because there's too many for me to pick Okay, and I'll just list them off. Okay. We need to poo a very merry poo year We watch that every Christmas uh, eve Right. It's the dopeness That just caught me off guard for some reason Home sweet home alone the new home alone that came out like last year quite good in my opinion Okay, home alone one and two were amazing three was okay four and five were hot garbage But the new one is quite good. I really really liked it and it has um The girl from the office the secretary from the office. Anyway, she's great. Um, the 3d animated grinch that's relatively new I thought that was excellent So much fun. Yeah, super good. Really liked it Christmas chronicles too. Really good Really good. Okay Um, and then also, uh, the naughty nine, which is very recent just came out like a couple couple weeks ago It's about these kids that are on the naughty list And they decide to steal all the toys from santa's workshop and they go up and like try and pull this heist So it's a heist movie with kids Christmas santa Magic it's fun. The tagline is rebels with a claws Rebels with a claw. I mean that makes me want to see it. You have to take a great point. Yeah That's genuinely won me over On a on a side note. Have you seen the the santa claws movies where there's oh, yeah, the santa claws We should have talked about those So I haven't seen them in a long time, but I recently watched a breakdown of how insane they are. Oh really? Yeah, like how insane they are. Well, like they basically a random guy becomes santa claws And then he starts to like lose his mind and then he has to kind of like Sacrifice his wife to like the santa gods to stay alive And it's like when you when you actually look at it from an outside perspective. It's insane Like it's really crazy now santa claws is a good time. I really like the first one. I think it's great Second one. I think is also good third one is not I think it's in the third one I've definitely seen one and two And then they have the uh the series out now Actually, which came out last year series was good It was good. It's fun. Have you seen a british christmas film called the nativity? No That's worth a watch. So you may get some chuckles out of that just because it's so british and so english It has um A guy that you'll know because he's in marvel. Does anyone ever pop over to the shops? During this Does anyone pop over to the shop pop into the shop martin freeman? You know martin freeman. Yeah, let's go ahead a minute. He was the this was kind of before he was a really big thing He did this yeah because he was in the office and and um, yeah, he was yeah, yeah That's worth a watch a little bit older now 2009 apparently. It's just the nativity It's got everything you want the kids would enjoy it's got some silliness some goofiness He's a teacher and the basically tells a little bit of a a porky pie. It's has a lie that um porky pie Which also pork pies aren't pie pork pies are pies Anyway, do you know do you know what a pork pie is? That are things we're going back to no, I don't know what that is And that's exactly what it sounds like google a pork pie And that's what a pie is That looks like a cake a cake. No Oh, okay. Yeah, that looks like a pie. That's a pie. Yeah, we call that a meat pie But so you would call it a pie So that is a pie if you just put the word meat in front of it. Yeah, but it's like this big, right? That's probably a good place to end I think so. Well, thank you everyone for hanging out and listening us listening to us talk about this stuff for some reason Yeah, as we've slowly declined to madness Merry Christmas. I hope you had as much fun as we did. This was a this was a good time. So um To all a good night. Yes. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Oh
