This is Mr. Alex Tech and yes, we're finally going to be having a look at the much anticipated DaVinci Resolve speed editor keyboard slash panel. It's a small keyboard that's designed to help you cut faster within DaVinci Resolve 17. Now there's two points there I just want to reiterate. First of all, it is designed primarily to be used with the cut page rather than the edit page. However, it will work within the edit page with a few exceptions. We'll cover that later in the video. And it is designed exclusively for DaVinci Resolve 17 and not DaVinci Resolve 60. Now the speed editor itself costs £282 in the UK and $295 in the US. However, there's currently an introductory offer on which means that if you buy a DaVinci Resolve studio license, you get the DaVinci Resolve speed editor for free. Now the license is exactly the same cost. So you can buy a DaVinci Resolve studio license and you get the DaVinci Resolve speed editor thrown in. So if you've been on the fence about upgrading to DaVinci Resolve studio for a while, now is absolutely the time to do it because you get this included. Now I did get this sent to me directly from Blackmagic. However, I do believe resellers have started to distribute these out around the world. So hopefully you should get yours if you've ordered one within the next couple of weeks. Now in the box itself, you get this speed editor. Obviously, you then get a couple of little leaflets. There's no full manual within here. There's simply a link to go and download the PDF copy of the website. And there's also no SD card or software installer. Again, you do it all online. There is also a couple of Blackmagic stickers, which is always nice. And then you get this USB type C to type C cable for connecting your speed editor. And here it is. This is the DaVinci Resolve speed editor itself. And as you can see, it is relatively compact. It's 156 millimeters tall and 245 millimeters wide. And it comes in at about 800 grams in weight. Now it is a predominantly plastic build, but it feels really well put together. There's absolutely no flex in the chassis whatsoever. Now the keys themselves feel like mechanical keys. They have a nice tactile feel and give plenty of feedback. On the top of the speed editor, we have the one and only port, which is the type C port used to connect the speed editor to your device. Now it's just worth pointing out that you can, of course, connect it via the type C to type C cable that's included within the box. However, my PC doesn't have a type C port, so I bought a type A to type C cable, and that works just fine. If cables aren't your thing, the speed editor does also have a built-in battery and Bluetooth connectivity. So you can connect it to your PC or laptop or whatever you're using via Bluetooth instead of the cable. Now connecting it is dead easy. You just open up your Bluetooth connectivity on your machine, find the speed editor, connect it like any other device. It takes two seconds and job done. The jog wheel over on the right hand side is a metal construction, and it has a real nice rubber texture around the outside to make sure that you can get a good grip. It has a real nice weight to it, and it is really, really nice to use. Above that, we've got three keys. We've got shuttle, jog, and scroll. Now these three keys control how the search style functions. So you can use it to make fine adjustments on your timeline, or you can use it to scrub through your timeline really quickly. Above that, we've got our source and timeline buttons. You just use these to hop between your source, media, and the timeline itself. In the middle, we've got our stop and play button here, and then above that, we've got all of these cam buttons. Now these camera buttons only work with this sync bin within the cut page at the moment. They don't work with traditional multi-cams on the edit page, so it'd be nice if that function was available in the future. Above that, we have a selection of just general keyboard functions. So we've got escape, transitions, split, sync bin, audio, snap, ripple, delete, and full view. To the left of that, we have our intelligent edit modes. So we've got smart insert, close up, place on top, append, ripple override, and source override. Underneath there, we have our two big white keys here, which are in and out markers. We then have our search dial live trimming. So we use the wheel combined with trim in, trim out, roll, slip source, slip destination. We can then also adjust the length of any transitions by holding the transition duration button. And then underneath there, we've got our transition type switching. So when we edit an edit point, we can choose to have it as a standard cut, a dissolve, or a smooth cut by using those three buttons. Cool. With that out of the way, I've got a couple of quick fire questions that have been asked a lot since I've received the speed editor. So I'm just going to whip through those and try and get them answered. First one I've already sort of covered, does it work on the edit page? The answer is yes, but there are some functions which are slightly limited. You can skip to the end of this video to see my actual demonstration of using it within the edit page. Does it work on any other page within DaVinci Resolve? Not really. It has very limited functionality on the color page, the fusion page, or the Fairlight page. It's designed specifically for the cut page, as mentioned, but will then work on the edit page. Can it be used with anything other than DaVinci Resolve? No. It's designed specifically to work in conjunction with DaVinci Resolve and DaVinci Resolve only. Once you've closed DaVinci Resolve, all the buttons that cease to function, you can't use it in anything else. Can you customize the keys to your own liking? At the moment, no. You're limited to just using DaVinci Resolve speed editor as it's designed to be used at the box. Again, Blackmagic may choose to include that in the future, we'll just have to wait and see. Can it be used in conjunction with a traditional keyboard and mouse? Yes. You can still use your keyboard and mouse within DaVinci Resolve in exactly the same way. Personally, I found it most useful when connecting to a laptop, so I've got it connected at the moment to a MacBook Air, and it's a real nice thing to have next to your laptop rather than a mouse. I'll use the keyboard for certain things and the trackpad, and then I'll just flip to the DaVinci Resolve speed editor to use the dial and a couple of the other shortcuts on there. How long does the battery last? I don't actually know. I've not managed to wear it down yet, but it certainly seems to last a considerably long time. After a good few hours of messing around with it on Bluetooth, I still have 80-90% of battery left, so you can easily get a full day's worth of editing out of the DaVinci Resolve speed editor. How do you check the battery level? Well, within DaVinci Resolve 17, there's an area you can go to check the battery level of the connected DaVinci Resolve speed editor. Can the speed editor be upgraded? Yes, you can connect the speed editor via USB to your machine and then upgrade the firmware as Blackmagic released it. So, with all that out of the way, let's open DaVinci Resolve and take a look at the speed editor in action. First up, you generally use two hands. So, you put two hands on the speed editor like so. Your right hand will be on the drug wheel and then you can use the left hand to hop between any shortcuts. Of course, you can still have your hand on the keyboard or mouse and do just the shortcuts with your left hand however works for you. So, the first thing, we've got this timeline and source buttons up here. So, if we hit timeline, it'll just make sure that we're on our timeline. If we hit source, this will open up our source tape. Now, as you can see, it's opened all of our footage onto one source tape. Now, it includes the two separate bins which I've got set up. So, we've got this one here which is some music and then we've got this stock footage here. If we just want the source tape to be for this general footage, we can just double click on the date to open up the source tape just for this bin. And then, from here, we can just use the drug wheel to scroll through forwards and then backwards. Now, the source tape combines all of your media into one source tape. So, if I'm having to click on each one, we can just scroll through all of the footage like it was on one big timeline. Now, at the moment, my drug wheel is set to jog which means that I have to rotate it and it will be proportionate just to how fast. So, I can go slow and do real slow movements or I can give it a big whip and it'll go a little bit quicker. If we change it to shuttle, shuttle allows you to hold it forwards a little bit to play in real time and then the more that you turn, that's four times speed. You can go to eight times, 18 times, 64, whatever we want and we'll return it to the upright position. It'll stop. If we go backwards, that does exactly the same thing but backwards. The scroll is very similar to the jog but it's much faster. So, then we can do real quick jumps around the timeline like so. I'm going to change it back to jog. And then from here, we can use our source tape to try and find the bits of footage that we want to add to our timeline and then we'll use our in and out point as well as our insert markers at the top here. So, let's just say we want this section here. I'm going to do an in there. I'll scroll forwards a little bit. I'll do an out and then I'm just going to hit an append to put that directly on my timeline. I'm still within the source tape so then I can just keep scrolling forward, find the next clip that I want in, out and then we can choose to either append it, place it on top, do a ripple or a source overwrite or a smart insert. I just want this to go at the end so I'm just going to hit append. If we just go back a little bit and let's say there's a section here which I wanted as a cut away, we can just mark an in and an out. So, we'll go for about there like so. If I hit timeline, I can hop to the timeline. I'll put my playhead where I want the cut away to be. So, let's just go about here. We jump back into source. I've still got that in and out point marked so then I can just hit place on top and it's just put that in and out section on top of our other footage on the timeline. So, as you can see, you can just really quickly hop between your source tape and your timeline marking your in and out markers and then using the input buttons to really quickly build up your timeline. So, let's just check a few more sections here. I'm going to jump onto my timeline, put my playhead at the end, we'll go back to source. We'll select this section here and we'll do an in and an out there and we're just going to append that to the end. We will, let's just go back a little bit on my timeline and we'll go here and we'll do source this time and instead of that, we're going to find a new clip. We'll do an in and an out there. I'm going to use a ripple overwrite which is going to overwrite the selected clip on the timeline with that new section that we've just chosen. So, as you can see, you can build up your timeline really, really quickly using the source tape, the in and out and then your insert buttons. So, let's hop onto the timeline itself and then we can use our jog wheel to jog around our timeline like so. Now, if you could look on the timeline, there's some small white markers and what that would do is it'll pick up the point that it thinks you want to work with because it's quite smart. You don't have to be right on the marker, you just have to be close to it and then we can start to use these two rows here for trims, slips and rolls. So, at this cutaway here, I want to trim that in. I can hold trim in, it'll select in green and then I can just roll the jog wheel forwards and backwards to trim that footage like so. If I select trim out, it will select the nearest trim out edit point and then we can roll that forwards and backwards. If it was the out point of this cutaway, I just need to scroll over, get it roughly where it needs to be, hit trim out and then I can just do the exact same thing. And then next to the trims, we've got roll. So, we've got this edit point here on my video track one. If that's in the wrong place, we can just hold roll, it'll select that and then we can roll it forwards or backwards on my timeline as needed. But, at least there, we've got slip, source and then slip, destination. So, if we hold slip, we can just roll that backwards and roll that forwards. If we hit slip, destination, it will select the second clip after the edit point and we can just roll that forwards and backwards so we can slip it in place. So, our edit points don't change, we're just changing the portion of the clip that we're using. And that's really the core function. That's the bit which is massively faster with Interventure Resolve. Rolling down to hop into your media poll, selecting your footage, choosing an out, dropping it on your timeline, you can do everything with the speed editor. You use your source state to really quickly add all the bits that you want onto your timeline and then you amend all of your edit point, your cutaways, all that sort of stuff, just using your trims, your slips and your rolls. We've also got this close-up button here in the top left. So, if I just put my play add on my timeline and hit close-up, it'll do a quick cutaway that's zoomed in. Now, it's not doing anything smart, it's not doing any tracking or intelligent zooms, but it will just do a quick zoom in like so. If we hold the close-up button, this can adjust the Y position. So, I'll hold that down and then use the jog wheel. And I can change the Y position of this clip so I can move it up and down. As far as I can see, there isn't a way to adjust the X axis, so you can only move it up and down and not left to right. Now, over here at this point on the timeline, you can see that we've got four clips stacked on top of each other and the top three are in exactly the same position. So, if I was to try and trim what it would do, I'd select all of them in one go so I could trim that in and out as one piece. But what if we just wanted to trim one of the clips? Well, we can use the camera buttons, so one, two, three, and in my case, four. So, I've hit camera two. It'll select track number two. We can see the little green highlight there. And then I can trim that one in and out. If I hit three, it'll select track three and then four to select track four. That is limited to the cut page. That doesn't do the same thing on the edit page. Next up, let's move into this middle section. We're going to come back to the source bin in a moment. Underneath here, you've got stop and play, which of course just gives you the ability to stop and play your footage. And then, of course, you can still use the jog wheel to go forward or backwards. And at the top here, you've got some really useful shortcuts. So, the first one I'm going to look at is this split. So, we can just put the playhead wherever we want. We can hit split and we can just create an edit point like so. We can then move our playhead over any of the sections that we want to delete and then we have a ripple delete button. So, if we hit that, it'll just delete that section from our timeline and move everything to fill in the gap. Up here, we've got an escape. However, if we double tap that, we have an undo. So, of course, I've just done a ripple delete. If I double tap that, we can just undo that ripple delete to get that clip back. We have full view. So, if I hit that, we can just go into full screen. We then have transitions and titles. So, again, I don't need to put my playhead directly over the edit point. It'll be smart enough to pick it up with that white marker. If I then hold this button down, it'll bring up all of the different transitions available to me. We can then just choose one. Let's go with a blur dissolve and release. And it will add that blur dissolve to the edit point like so. If we get our playhead again, roughly over it, down here, there's this transitions duration. If we hold that, we can then adjust the length of that transition as we need to. Again, if that was incorrect, we didn't want that. We can just double tap undo and undo again to get rid of it. We've then got a snap button which enables snapping by turning it on and off. And then if we double tap and hold the snap on the second tap, we can then use the jog wheel to increase and decrease our preview window size like so. Now, the split key also doubles as a move key. So, if we hold that down, the footage on our timeline goes red. Then we can just use the jog wheel to move that to different edit points. But it does just hop between the edit points themselves. So, it's really useful just for reordering your footage. If you want to actually slide your footage around, if we shoot back over to this left section here, you've got the roll key, this also doubles as a slide. So, if we double tap and hold down, we now have the red marker again around the footage. We can use that jog wheel to just slide that around our timeline like so. So, now let's talk about the sync bin and the audio level. So, I've added some music to my timeline. And if I need to adjust the volume, I can hold the audio level and then we can just use our jog wheel to increase and decrease the volume as we need to. Now, if we hit sync bin, we can jump straight into the sync bin. So, I've already synced this footage up with the music track. So, we've got two different angles and then we can just use the camera buttons down here. So, at any point, I can just hit camera one. This is my camera one point. I can then amend the in and out. So, I can choose the in and out point for camera one. And then I can choose source overwrite or ripple overwrite. So, I'm going to hit source overwrite and now add that section to my timeline. We can then scroll through to the next section wherever we want. And then if we were to hit camera two, it would select camera two. We can use that in and out from there as well. And then alternatively, rather than clicking on the camera's marking in and out point and then inserting it, we can actually just hold the camera two button to select our camera two angle and then use our jog wheel to play through. And it will just lay down the camera two track like so. If we want to jump back to camera one, we'll click and hold camera one and do the same thing. Now, what's really nice about this is if we go to full view, we can actually view all the different angles within the sync bin in full screen and just edit the multi cam sync bin footage as we go. So, I can hold camera one. We can roll through. We can see the footage. We'll then hit camera two and we'll keep going. And you can really quickly build up this timeline like so. Of course, you've got options here to select between video only and audio only if you need to. And then lastly, you've got live overwrite. And that pretty much sums up the basic functionality of the speed editor within the cut tab. So how much of that does actually transfer over to the edit tab? Let's jump into the edit tab and take a look. First of all, let's talk about the jog wheel. The jog wheel works in fundamentally the same way here as it does on the cut page. So I'm currently set to jog. I can just move around my timeline like so. I've got access to shuttle and scroll to move around the timeline quicker if I need to. And then we've got the source and timeline buttons. Now, these do work, but they're just not as useful as they are within the cut page. And that's predominantly because we don't have access to the source tape. So if I hit source, I can jump into some source media, but it'll only hop into the current media that I've got selected. So you can see here, this clip is highlighted in red. This is the one that we've got currently. I can then scrub through it using the jog wheel, mark any in and out points, and then use all of these different insert options if I need to. So all of these work as normal. I'm just going to hit append to add that to my timeline. And then if I hit source, all we're going to do is jump back into that exact same clip. So that's fine if you want multiple sections from the same clip, but it's not as useful, obviously, as the source tape to hop up between different pieces of media. All I need to do in the media pool with my mouse, just double click on the media that I want, I can then select the in and out points and add it to my timeline as I need to. Alternatively, what you could do is select multiple pieces of media, add that to your timeline like so, and then actually edit or cut or trim it in place on the timeline and work that way instead. Once on the timeline, these buttons down here in the lower left do work in the same way as you'd expect them to. So we've got trims, rolls and slips. If we just hold trim, I can trim in this in point here. And if you hold trim out, I can trim the out point. If I come over to this edit point here and hold roll, I can roll this edit point forward and back like so. And then if we hold slip source, I can slip this source and the same for the destination. If we double tap and hold the roll to select slide, I can slide this clip forwards and backwards on my timeline like so. We've also then got cut, dissolve and smooth cut. So if I just come over to this edit point here and hit smooth cut, it will just add the smooth cut in place like so. This middle section here, the only thing that really works is the play and pause button because all of these camera buttons are linked to the sync bin, which of course isn't available within the edit page, only the cut page. Moving over to the top row of buttons here, we've got the escape button, which doubles as the undo. So if I double tap that, I can just undo like so. The transition button will add a transition or add the standard transition. So if I just hit that, I'll add the transition like so. However, if I hold that button down, I don't have access to the pop-up transitions menu like I do on the cut page because it's not available within the edit page. The sync bin, of course, is limited to cuts, so that's not available either. The audio level button does work, so for us to hold that, I could adjust the audio. However, I currently don't have any audio for this track here, I have a separate music track. So what I need to do is click on the music track itself, then hold the audio, and then I can adjust the audio levels for that track. Full view works as normal, so I can hop in and out of the full screen view. Then we've got snap, which enables you to toggle on and off snapping. And then we've got this split and ripple delete. So I can just move my playhead where I want it, and then if I hit split, it'll just add a cut onto the timeline. However, as you can see, it's made a cut all the way through the timeline, so it's applied a cut here to this video clip and to this separate audio. And that's because we haven't actually got that clip highlighted when we did the split, so it's just done it all the way through the timeline. So the problem with that is if I was to move my playhead over this clip here, let's say I don't want to do anything to the music track, I just want to delete this video. If I hit ripple delete, you can see it's actually going to ripple delete a section from the audio as well. So to get around that, what you can do, go to timeline, and make sure that selection follows playhead is enabled. And what that means is wherever your playhead is, it will automatically make a selection as well. So now you can see that the clip is actually highlighted in red, whereas it wasn't before. So now if I hit a split, it'll just do the split on the clip itself rather than all the way through the timeline. If I then hit ripple delete, we'll just delete the clip rather than amending the audio as well. Now with that in mind, there isn't an easy way to select which track you want to edit when working on the edit page. So unlike the cut page, if I hover over this section here where we have multiple different tracks, I can't use the one, two, three, or four camera buttons to select the relevant track, it's just going to guess which one it thinks I want to work with, by whichever one is closest to the playhead. But obviously that gets confused when there are multiple tracks all in the same position. So yes, as you can see, you can make it work on the edit page, but you will get more out of your speed editor if you stick to the cut page. Now it's always difficult to adjust to a new piece of hardware like this anyway, because you've got all this muscle memory you've built up from using a keyboard and mouse. If you then get used to your speed editor on the edit page, it's going to be even more difficult to try and transition over to the cut page. So my personal recommendation, if you've ordered a speed editor, when it arrives, just give the cut page a go. Use your speed editor in the cut page exclusively, at least initially, even if it's only for a short period, and see if you like it and see if you can feel the benefits. If you don't enjoy the cut page with the speed editor, then fair enough, hop over to the edit page. But if you want to make the most of your new purchase, I do recommend that you start off trying it in the cut page. Now that pretty much covers everything I wanted to cover in this video.
