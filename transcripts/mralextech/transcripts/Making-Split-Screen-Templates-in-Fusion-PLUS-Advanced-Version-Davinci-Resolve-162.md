What up folks, Alex here and today we're jumping into Fusion. Now this video does take a tiny bit of Fusion knowledge but I keep it relatively basic so if you're new to Fusion you should still be able to follow along. What I'm going to do is take you through the steps I used to create my split screen templates which I gave out in yesterday's Five Minute Friday. If you happen to find this video before you've seen that one I recommend going watching that video first, this one will make more sense, the video is linked down in the description below. Now the first half of this video I'm going to show you exactly how I made the simple overlays using Fusion as well as how to export them. So there's a few juicy little nuggets of information within there and then the second half I'm going to show you how to make them using an alternative method which has some real cool advantages but a couple of disadvantages as well. Everything will be timestamped so you should see the chapters on the video so you can skip to the bits that you want to ignore any other bits that you don't want. So enjoy! We're on the Edit tab, first things first as you all know, Effects Library, Toolbox, Effects, Fusion Composition, just drag that, add it onto your timeline, doesn't really matter the length you can adjust that in a moment, give it a click and then head into Fusion. Cool! Now all we've got at the moment is our media out so we need to start adding some stuff. Now there's loads of different ways to do this sort of thing as always with Fusion there's loads of different ways to achieve the same thing. I'm going to use the cookie cutter method, I don't know if it's called that, I like to refer to it as the cookie cutter method and you'll see why in a moment. So what we basically need to do is to create a shape that covers the whole screen then we're going to create other shapes to cut the things out that we want. So first things first we're going to grab a rectangle which is this one here, just drag that down here somewhere and then we're going to grab this one which is a background node and we're going to put this one over towards our media out which is connect our rectangle to our background and then our background to our media out. Now the rectangle is literally just this shape which you can just drag and resize and then the background is pretty much just the color of that shape. Now what we want to do for this one is to make it the same size as our frame and then we can cut the bits out we don't want. So I'm just going to select the rectangle in the inspector, I'm just going to go the width all the way to one and height all the way to one as well. So it's the same size now as that frame. What I do like to do for peace of mind even though it's not really required but I like to make that bigger than the frame just to be on the safe side so I'll actually put that to 1.1. Now note if we've got this rectangle here if we look in the inspector we've got level, filter, soft edge, border width and then it goes straight to border style. However if we grab another rectangle, drag that down here put it on that line like so. So we've got rectangle 1, rectangle 2, give rectangle 2 a click in the inspector you've now got level, filter, soft edge, border width and then you've got paint mode. So if you do a rectangle after another rectangle you can change the way the second rectangle influences the first one. So at the moment they just sort of merge them together but if we change merge to subtract this rectangle whatever we do to it actually just deletes bits from this rectangle. So then we can make this one the size of our sort of frames which will then leave us with our border. So what we need to do is to make this rectangle the shape that we want. Now I messed around to get this exactly right so I'm going to put my center as 252 my x center sorry that is my height is going to be 0.98 and my width is 0.49 and that will give us nice small little gap at the top the sides and down the bottom and then we can just give that one a click, control and c to copy, control and v to paste, quick tip if you don't already know if you hold if I try and put that there as you see it won't just naturally go in if you hold shift on your keyboard you can then also select the line and it will just pop it in there. So we've then made a duplicate so we've got three triangles this is the same size we can then just move this over, get it in the right place and there you go that is literally it if we were to head back into the edit tab I'm just going to grab I'll just do a solid color for now put solid color underneath that change the color of it there you go there's our frame and that's literally all I did to create the frames for the previous five minute Friday video obviously that's rectangles if you want to do circles or ellipses you can use ellipses and then you can also just do free hand polygons so let me just delete this one for now I'm going to grab polygon and we'll just draw the basic shape that will do we'll change the paint mode to subtract and there you go let me just undo this a wee bit there we go now another quick thing I'll show you while we're here we'll do a few fusion tips while we're in this video I'll go to my rectangle two which is this one here and I can adjust the corner radius but we don't want to have to do them individually we want whatever happens to this one to also happen to this one now again really easy right click on your corner radius go to publish and then you get a little keyframe marker over here we're going to go to our rectangle two underscore one which is our duplicate one we're going to right click on corner radius we're going to connect to and then from here we'll see rectangle two and we'll see the corner radius so we can give that a click and all that basically means is anything we change on rectangle two will also happen on our rectangle two underscore one I should have renamed them better so it's easy to understand but you get the principle you want to change the color of the frame that's just done within the background just change the color so now you've got that ready you want to export it like I did so you've got a dot settings file which you can then put it within your generators they're ready to use all the time again it's actually really really simple now there's a key here you need to select the nodes in the order that you want them to appear within the inspector on the edit tab so for mine I had the corner radius at the very top and then you selected the color so the thing with the corner radius is a rectangle two so we're going to click that one first I'm going to hold control on my keyboard I'm then going to select the background because that's the one with the color and then I can select the rest in any order at all it doesn't matter so we'll select those two we don't need to let media out at all we just need to select our working nodes like so and then we can right click on one of the nodes go to macro and then we're going to click create macro at the top and you'll get this appear this is the macro editor so we're going to give it a name let's just call this split x2 something like that and then if I just shrink this you can see these all match up to your node so we've got rectangle two which was the first one we selected then we've got ignore publish then we've got the background one and then we've got the rectangle two and the rectangle one so again now in the order that we selected them so the first thing we want to do rectangle two rectangle two we'll expand that and then you've got a bunch of different options for rectangle two while this is open you can still look at these so if I can't remember the thing which I want to publish I want to be able to change within the edit tab I can just click on rectangle two and I can view all the settings in here you can see if you hover over this it's in the controls area and it's the corner radius so rectangle two controls corner radius all we need to do tick that box there's literally it if you want to rename it so it's not called corner radius you can change that name you just change this wording in here to whatever you want then we're going to just close rectangle two we're going to go to the background one again we can click on background one if we want to hover over here it's in the color it's the color we don't want the type because it's just going to be solid color I don't want people to be messing around with gradient so just color and then we've got the color red green blue and alpha so we're going to go background one image don't care about image color here we go don't care about type but we've got color now this always looks a bit weird you've got top left green blue alpha top left red all we need to do pay attention to this wording here just make sure that you tick color green blue alpha in the left areas and that will mean that this whole color table like this will appear and that's it then we go to file save as it will default it to this macros folder which is in your app data I'm just actually going to swing straight into my fusion template edit generators folder instead you should know the one it's listed it'll be in the description as I'll see you can check that out so here it is here are all my fusion generators which appear within my edit tab we'll call this demo so I know exactly the one we're referring to and then we'll hit save now if I was to shut down the venturi solve and then reopen it it will appear if I head back into the edit tab within my generators fusion generators it will appear in here it won't appear just yet you have to turn it off and get it back on which is annoying because if you want to test it how do you know if it's working without rebooting DaVinci all the time well all you can do if we just delete both of these we've exported it so we don't care about really losing our work delete that one delete that one I'm going to go to effects I'm going to grab a fusion composition and then going to head into fusion and then outside of DaVinci resolve I'm just going to open up a file explorer my computer whatever you want to call it I'm going to head to that folder little C drive program files black magic DaVinci resolve fusion templates edit generators and then within here I've got my demo and what we can do click it drag it release it and it'll put it straight into our fusion you just connect that up to our media out and we can see if it's working or not to see if those additional edit controls have pulled through give it a click in the inspector you'll see the controls as they'll appear within the edit tab so I've got my corner radius that's working and then I've also got my color happy days now you'll notice that that is just one node I can't actually drill into that I can't open it I can't ungroup it I can't see what's working behind the scenes that's because it's a macro so another little tip for you I'm just going to delete that within the folder I've got split x2 demo if I right click I'm going to go to edit that I'll open it up in notepad second line down split x2 you can as a macro operator just change the word macro to group with a capital G save that close that do the exact same thing drag that and now you can see it's stacked because it's a group not a macro so if we double click we can actually see what's going on and then if we right click we can ungroup it and we've got all over our original nodes and that's it really now these are great they're really easy to make and then once you've made them people don't need to go into fusion to mess around because everything just works the end of the day it is just an overlay though so it does have its downside if I go into edit obviously being just an overlay if I put video underneath it spills into both and then I have to do some cropping it's the easiest way for people to do it without having to mess in fusion which is the reason I did it that way but there is a better way to do these within fusion which means that these sort of frames are completely set you don't need to crop you can just attach the footage you know automatically fit within the frame so that's what we're going to have a quick look at now so I'm going to delete everything we'll start fresh going to grab a fusion composition make sure for this one that you've imported some footage already because you'll need it there to test so we're going to leave that as is and then we're going to head into fusion so we've got our media out I'm going to grab some footage drop that down here so we've got a media in and then we're just going to connect those two together now what we want to do is to put a mask around our media in so that only the thing within the mask will be seen and then you can just move the footage within the mask however you want it now there is a really simple quick easy way to do that if I grab a rectangle just put it to the left of our media in and connect it into our little blue marker that makes a mask and then wherever we move that as you can see only the footage within there appears then that doesn't export particularly well because you have to do the rectangle before the media only gets a bit confused and then obviously if we use a transform and put it here you end up moving everything so that's not quite right so we want to achieve the same thing but in a slightly different way so we've got our media in what we're going to do is to grab a merge node and just put that down move over a little bit there we go merge nodes all they do is merge two things together you've got foreground and a background the foreground is green the background is yellow we want the media in to be the foreground so you could just drag and put it on the green or easy way right click swap the inputs and there we go and what you want there is a background so grab a background and connect it to the background like so and then you actually want to click on background in the inspector drag the alpha all the way down so we're going to make that alpha alpha just means that that's invisible basically it's completely see-through anything underneath will appear through so we've got our media in and then we've got an alpha and then all we want to do is to apply a mask to our merge node so we're going to grab a rectangle put it down here and then attach that as a mask and there you go so now anything within the mask will appear as the media want if I hit play we can see that it's playing but everything outside of the mask i.e the background will be completely invisible because we've made it an alpha so then if we grab another background i'm going to put this over here just before the media out it'll automatically create a merge for you at the minute everything just looks black that's because it's gone the wrong around so our background which is just black is currently our foreground so we're just going to right click on the merge swap the inputs and there we go so let's actually make this quite nice let's do the same thing let me reset the size of that perfect and then what we can do if we grab a transform node which is this one here if we were to put the transform here and move it around we'd be moving everything that's come before it so the media in the background the merge and the rectangle so that's not what we want if we put the transform before that like so now our mask our square our rectangle whatever you want to call it will always remain exactly where it is but we can use the transform to move the footage within the frame so then once you've set these up there will be exactly where you want them to be every single time and you just move the footage within the frame to where you want it without having to crop or do anything fancy the other cool thing with this again because you don't need to do any cropping or anything at all you can make these whatever shape you want they could be zigzags they could be whatever they could be all over the show you can just have some fun with it so that's just one input at the minute that's all we're going to do copy these four nodes we're going to do a control c we'll come down here and do a control v paste them down there put them somewhere there just so it's nice and tidy we're going to grab a merge node and just put that up here we're going to grab another merge node and put it down here and then if we connect this one to this one this one this one up to this one and then we're going to grab our rectangle which is our mask and we're going to move that over here now we can't see anything because we've got no media in so let's add some more media a different clip this time put this one down here and attach that to there and there you go so we need to move that reset that and there you go so hopefully that makes some sense it looks complicated but it's actually not really this frame now is completely static and you can just drag clips in no need to crop because they will never overlap each other it'll just appear through the frame and you can set them up really handy now if you wanted to export this again it works really well so what we want to do we want to publish we don't want to do too much we're just going to do the center the side and the angle from these transform nodes and that's all we want published for the time being so we're going to remember that we've got transform one transform two let's be sensible let's call this if you click on the node and then f2 you get the rename tool so then we can just call this one left we're going to call this one right it'll make our lives a little bit easier we're going to select left and then right and then we'll just select everything else we're going to right click we're going to macro we're going to create a macro we're going to go to our macro editor this is just going to be called split x2 better or something like that and then we've got left we want the controls what controls we want we want the center size angle and that'll do us so we got center don't worry about pivot size angle that should be enough center size angle now these are the names that appear so just to make it easier again when we're editing we're going to call this one left so we've got left center left size left angle and go to right same thing center size angle but we'll call these right cool cool cool we're going to file we're going to save that and we're going to put them in the same place as before generators save that perfect perfect close that we're going to open up that folder what does it call it again oh yeah better we're going to right click we're going to edit we're going to change this to be a actually we don't necessarily need to do this but i'll do this or my life either group operator save that close that close that now for consistency to show this will work properly i'm just going to restart dementia resolve as of right now and through the power of editing we're back so now we're just going to hop into the effects library toolbars generators fusion generators let's find our better there it is drag that on there straight away if we open up the inspector we've got a left center size angle and our right center size angle so that's working if we hop into fusion here we go we've got our group now because we had two inputs when we grouped it you can see we've got two inputs ready to go so that's perfect so let's just grab two files so we've got two media ins and we'll connect them up and there you go so they've automatically gone straight into our area straight into our boxes and that's perfect so we can head back to edit and then we've got our left center size angle so we can just move the center size we can move the size we can angle it can do whatever we want you can just adjust them you never need to worry about cropping or whatever it just works now i need to let you know this one of the big downsides and the reason i didn't do this one for my five minute friday or haven't made them available so everyone just yet is because what we're doing here is grabbing just plain unedited media files from a media pool and then attaching them to our split which means it's a bit more difficult to do a sequence the reason why around it all you need to do go to your edit tab i've already sort of started doing this one let's do this i've chopped together my sequence how i want it so it's just a few clips thrown together then we're just going to highlight them all right click new compound clip give it a name create that i can then delete that from my timeline i'm going to add my better split head into fusion we'll grab just this one this one can be here same as before but then this time we can grab our compound clip we can add that as another input and as we play through it's the coffee cup on the right hand side and then it'll jump through to the mixer and then it'll jump through to me hanging around so you can do it this is just an extra step it's whether the extra flexibility i've been able to do this way outweighs the inconvenience of the way you've got to edit you just got to wait and see which works best for you but there you go hopefully this video is giving you both options so you can just decide whichever works best for you and that's it i hope you enjoyed this video if you do like these longer form fusion tutorials please do let me know pop a comment down below and i'll have a look and i can do some more in the future also i hope these are really useful for you the split screens are great there's lots of different ways to to do them obviously and there's lots of different uses for them so whichever way works for you if you do create some cool ones you use them for some cool effects do let me know i'd love to come and have a look and see what you guys do like comment subscribe all that good stuff thanks for watching until next time see you bye you
