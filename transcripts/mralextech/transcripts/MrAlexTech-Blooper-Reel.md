## Transcript
The video literally nobody asked for. What up folks? It's Alex here. Now the channel's been doing really well recently and we have been talking about some complicated stuff so to prove that I am indeed human and not a computer, here are my 5 minute f***** ups. Now the idea for this video is to just give you a couple of minutes of something amusing to watch but also if you are trying to do a YouTube channel yourself and you keep screwing things up, hopefully this will encourage you to keep persevering. I make mistakes all the time, embarrassingly this little montage you're about to see is only from the past couple of months and there are a hell of a lot more that I've excluded from this video. So don't worry about them screw ups, keep working away and you'll get there eventually. Anyway let's roll the VT and I hope you enjoy this little montage at my expense. What up folks? Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo has had a few too many. But yeah, they go there too. They're just boo. So we're starting now whipping through all the eventual. Thank you very much. Let's open the winch resolve. Thumbs up. Any hip or trick. Once the file that kills a video, audio, this is a different thing. It's free. I can't find it. Slightly more wuffly. So that's what in this video, so in this video and audio, I'm going to zoom to Y, zoom to and that's it and that's it and that's it and that's it and that's it and that's it. Easy as that. Bye.
