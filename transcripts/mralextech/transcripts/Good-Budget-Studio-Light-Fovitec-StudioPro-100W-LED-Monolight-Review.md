Foveatech UK are actually giving one of these away over on their Instagram page. So if you're from the UK or the EU, shoot over to Instagram, have a look at Foveatech UK. There's a link down in the description below to see how you could be in with the chance of winning this very monolight. What up folks? Alex here, Mr Alex Tech, and this is the Foveatech Studio Pro 100W Monolight. So first up, price. It's £120 in the UK, available from Foveatech.co.uk, and in the US it's 170 bucks, usually, however, at the minute there's over 50% off and you can pick one up for just 80 bucks, which is a bit of a steal. It's a 100 watt Cobb style LED, producing light that's around 95 plus on the CRI scale. It is a single colour light, so there's no adjustment for white balance, however, it's daytime balanced at 5600K, and it comes in at 5,620 looks at 1 meter, with the included reflector attached. Right, let's crack open the box and I'll show you exactly what you get. So here it is, crack it open. There's not much in here, so it's real quick unboxing. First up, we've got a power cable. This is a 2-prong, I think it's a US style. Then we've, of course, got the UK power adapter. I've already opened that as you can tell. And then of course, we've got the light itself. Now, handily, it also comes with this little protector, so you can protect the LED when it's in transit. And then last but not least, we've got this metal seven-inch Bowens style reflector. And that's it, that's all you get in the box. And here it is. Now, as you can see, the body is made mainly of hard plastics and aluminium, while the actual light stand mount at the bottom is made entirely of metal, and it does feel reassuringly solid. Now it mounts to your light stand in the same way any other mount does, so you just plug it on there and you've got a screw style tightener to tighten that up. And then you've also got this pinch style adjustment knob on the side to adjust the angle of the light. Now, there's no clicks in there or hard stops, so you've got infinite levels of adjustment. Now, sometimes with these pinch style tightness, you can end up with a little bit of slip, but so far in my usage, even with a relatively heavy front light modifier attached, it hasn't slipped or changed angles on me just yet. Now, as you can see, it's relatively compact, but admittedly, there are smaller mono lights available on the market. Weight is pretty reasonable, it comes in at just over two kilos with the reflector attached. We have vents across the top and the bottom to help with heat. And at the rear, we've got a plastic carry handle just to make life a little bit easier. And then if we flip it all the way around on the back, we've got all of our main controls. Now, there's nothing fancy here, it's relatively simple. We've got our power socket, we have a simple power adjustment knob, we've got a simple LED display, and then we've got our power switch for on and off. Now, the power is provided by an AC mains cable. There's no option here to run this thing off a battery or a battery pack, you're stuck to plugging it into a wall. Fortunately, the power cable that's provided is really long, it's at least 15 foot long, which always gets a really big thumbs up from me. And it's also nice and thick, which hopefully means it should last for the duration of the light. Now, on occasion, I have had the power cable wiggle through while I've been moving this light around my little studio. Not often, and it's not really a big deal, you just need to make sure that you push it back in, but I figured it was worth mentioning. Now, power goes from 0 to 10 or 0 to 100%, as I think of it, which means it obviously jumps in 10% increments. It would have been nicer to see more granular control, maybe 5, 2, or even 1% increments, but you are stuck with those 10% jumps. Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, it is a single color, so there's no adjustments on the back for white balance. However, it is balanced at the generally considered really useful 5600K. Combine that with the CRI rating of 95 plus means you should get decently balanced, nice quality light out of this thing. Now, on the front, we've got a Colt style LED, which is mounted to an aluminium heat sink. Now, the front element does give off some heat and can get quite warm during extended use. Now, to help dissipate some of that heat, there is an internal cooling fan, which, while audible, isn't too loud. Providing you keep your microphone at least a foot or so away from the light, it shouldn't be picked up in your video, but just to see if it is, let's do a couple of quick tests. So, here I am standing just behind the camera in front of the phobia tech. Now, it's currently switched off, so I'm just going to let you listen to, hopefully, silence. And now we're just going to switch it on. Now, I'm only a foot or so away from the light at the moment, just using the same microphone I've been using for the entirety of this video. And we'll flick it off. When you flick it off, it just takes a second or two to actually turn off. And there you go. Now, it's also worth noting that the fan kicks in as soon as you turn the unit on, and it seems to run at a consistent speed. It doesn't speed up or slow down depending on the power. It's always running and always making the same amount of noise, whether you're running at 10% power or 100% power. Now, the light has a 120 degree beam angle, which means without any light modifiers, only to tall, it just sort of sprays light all over the place. Now, that, of course, is where this comes in. This is the seven inch reflector that is included within the box. And it does a really good job of condensing all that light and reducing the beam angle down to just 45 degrees. However, it does a really great job of condensing the light. It does very little in terms of softening the light. So you will still get harsh shadows from this thing out the box without using any other additional light modifiers. So if you're looking for nice soft light from this thing, you are going to have to have a look at purchasing some additional light modifiers. Fortunately, this thing has two types of light modifier mount. Of course, at the front, you've got this Bowens style mount, which means you can attach any Bowens star modifier straight away without any sort of adapter, which is really handy. But then you've also got a simple umbrella mount on the bottom as well. If you don't have any Bowens style adapters, you can just use those cheap shoot through or reflective style umbrellas, which you can pick up for literally a couple of quid, which gives you loads of loads of options. Now, I think that's really cool. I think it's really handy. It means you can start making use of a light like this without having to spend a fortune on expensive light modifiers. You just pick up some cheap umbrellas and start having some fun with it. Now, in terms of flickering, Fovetext claimed that this light is flicker free, do seem to hold up. The light is currently set to 10%. I'm shooting at 25 frames per second, but the shutter speed of 150th of a second. And what we're going to do is just increase our shutter speed. There's one 100th for second, one 1000th of a second, one 2000th of a second, one 4000th of a second, and lastly one 8000th of a second. And as you can see, regardless of the shutter speed we're using, there is zero flickering. Right, now we're going to do a few tests so I can highlight the changes in exposure and softness when using some of the different modifiers available. The camera is set to F 5.6, shooting at 150th of a second and ISO 100. The light is set to 50%. It's about arms length away from me and this is just with the bare LED. So let's put the 17 inch reflector on first and see how that changes things. Now the camera's not changed and the light's not moved at all. We've just put the reflector on and straight away from here that feels brighter. It's really quite bright, even at only 50%. So let's try something a little bit bigger and a little bit softer. Now this is the Fovitec lantern light. So this should give us really soft omnidirectional light. So we'll shove that on now and we'll see how that looks. Now it's a bit big which is the hand side but you should see that's really nice soft light on me. Let's move you over a bit. Now the actual light is a little bit further away but the light source i.e. this light modifier is actually probably a little bit closer. So that should give you a rough idea of the difference in exposure and the softness change. Right last but not least let's try an umbrella. Oh man this is far too big. And this is with a really cheap but really big umbrella softbox which have just attached via the umbrella mount. Right we're going to keep with the umbrella and the monolight for the duration of this video. So as you can see using the different light modifiers obviously makes a world of difference to your usage with this light. On its own without any modifiers it's really bright but it doesn't have that many uses because it's just a little bit too harsh. The reflector obviously helps you direct that light but it doesn't soften it up any. So really to make the most use of it you do need to get yourself a nice light modifier. Now the joy of this light having two different mounting options means there's loads of choice out there so you can literally just shop around to get the modifier that works for you. Now obviously having all those different options is really useful. Makes this light extremely versatile. However the big downside if like me you're a little bit limited for space a light like this with a nice soft modifier does take up lots of room. Now if you are short for space like me you can still make it work if you're a little bit creative. However an LED light panel like that one behind me may actually be a better option. You just need to weigh up whether you want the power and the versatility of a monolight or the practicality of an LED panel. So to finish up let's just talk about that price. It really is in my view a really good price. £120 for a 100 watt monolight is a good price. In fact I don't think you can find a 100 watt monolight for much cheaper if I'm honest and I have had a quick look around. If you're in the state obviously $170 is again pretty reasonable but at the moment the fact that you can pick it up for 80 bucks really is a bit of a steal. So overall I am quite a big fan of this light. It feels relatively well put together. It's not too big or heavy. It produces nicely balanced good quality light and it has a world of modifier options thanks to those two different mounting points all for a really reasonable price. But that's just what I think.
