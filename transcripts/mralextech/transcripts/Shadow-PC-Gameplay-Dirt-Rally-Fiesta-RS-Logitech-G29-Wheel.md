What up folks, it's Alex here and today we're going to be having a play with this which is my Logitech G29. We're going to be running on that which is my shadow box. That desktop there is my shadow PC and we're going to be playing Dirt Rally. Now those of you that know Dirt Rally know it's a very fast-paced game which takes quick reactions. It's not a game where you want loads of latency so let's see how Shadow handles it. Because I know someone's going to ask I'm on Virgin 200 megabit broadband and based in the West Midlands in the UK and I get roughly a 30 millisecond ping to the Shadow servers. Let's crack on shall we? Now just before we get into it, so I know someone will ask, graphics are set to run on high video mode. There you go it's running natively on this 1920x1080 monitor at 75 hertz. Yes you can run it on ultra, it runs really well on ultra. I've put it to high just while I'm screen recording just to make sure I don't get any odd dips. We're going to rally, this guy on that one, going to Wales. The AI difficulty is on elite. I'm not quite back up to master yet hopefully we'll be soon and the stage we're doing is the River Severn Valley. Now we're not going to do it at night because then you're going to see anything. We're going midday and cloudy and then the car we'll use is 2010 and I like the Fiesta RS rally.
