For just £599 you can get the brand new entry-level base model Mac Mini combined with the free version of DaVinci Resolve. But is it any good and could you use it as your only editing computer? We're about to find out! Now we are only talking about the free version of DaVinci Resolve in this video but if you want to know how it holds up in the studio version maybe hit that subscribe button because there will be another video coming later this week. What up folks my name is Alex MrAlexTech and I've actually picked up the base model Mac Mini and I'm going to try using it as my main rig for the next couple of weeks. As mentioned this base model is available for £599 the same in dollars in the US. You get a 10 core CPU, 10 core GPU, 16 core neural engine for all of your AI stuff, 16 gig of unified memory or RAM as it's more commonly called which is actually quite nice. 16 gig previous generations the minimum was 8 gig that's gone everything starts at 16 now which gets a thumbs up from me and just 256 gigs of SSD storage. Honestly that's kind of the big stumbling block that's the main issue people are going to come across because 256 gig generally isn't enough. Fortunately this Mac Mini has five in total USB type-c ports three of which are Thunderbolt 4. All of them are capable of up to 40 gigabits transfer speeds which means providing you're using some decent external SSDs you should be okay because you can store all of your media on these just plug them in via type-c and run all your media off that. So yes it's £599 you are going to have to buy some external SSDs it's a little bit more but hopefully you've already got some lying around. I actually went one step further and for about £160 I bought this Ugreen external NVMe SSD enclosure that's about 60 quid and then I bought this two terabyte NVMe SSD so I'm going to be running everything after that. It's really really quick it runs about 3000 megabytes per second both read and write so it's actually quicker than the internal SSD anyway so for 160 quid I've kind of upgraded my Mac Mini from 256 to two terabytes. Winner. But the main question how does it all run DaVinci Resolve? Well stick around because I'm going to show you pretty chilled out casual kind of real life real time look at how the free version of DaVinci Resolve runs on the new Mac Mini. I'm also recording everything externally so the performance won't be affected. Now the first thing to show you start up times. So DaVinci Resolve isn't currently running I'm going to hit the button on my stream deck now and the loading screen's on my other monitor so that's actually on now it'll load in a second on the main screen there it is. So however long that was not very long at all so when it comes to starting your edit actually getting into DaVinci Resolve is really nice and quick. Now the first thing I did to test this was I dropped a massive project in there and then just jumped on to see how responsive it felt and I was really really impressed so I'm actually going to replicate that now so you can see it for yourself. So on my external SSD I've got this free demo DRA that's a DaVinci Resolve archive file and it's massive it's 110 gig it's full of different timelines and different media files there's 4k there's all sorts of stuff going on there. What we're going to do is this is all in real time this project doesn't yet exist within DaVinci Resolve we're going to drop that in there that's going to import it and link it all and we're going to open it up and we're just going to go cut page source tape which is going to compile all of the the media on one big timeline and look at this this is 4k well I think pretty much everything in here is 4k this is some anamorphic that's actually 6k this is 4k there's some long gop there's some all-intra there's some 265 4k from Osmo pocket and just look how responsive this is it's really really quite impressive and I know all we're doing is reading it but the fact that it's able to read this so quick and give us such a responsive UI is really impressive and what we can do is just grab all of these I've got a 4k timeline ready to go drop it on there jump to the edit page let's just zoom out a little bit whip around this timeline really quick we can then start doing some cutting along here we can do some ripple deletes and get rid of some of this stuff we can give this one a click what is this this is h.264 10 bits 422 30 frames we can just zoom this in and do the rotation maybe mess with the pitch whatever just blasting around this timeline buttery smooth so that everyday usability initially feels really impressive but how does it feel actually kind of cutting up and working on a timeline so we've got an ultra hd 30 fps timeline right here we've got a bunch of obs this is all 4k obs recordings and once again we can kind of trim through this really quickly with no real issues and then we've got my main cam once again this is all h.264 10 bit 422 this scrubs through really nicely all 4k now this is the kind of the workflow I actually do my day today I've got to link up some external audio so let's do that first and see how quick that works auto sync wave form we'll sync that nice and quick it's actually quite long as well this was how long that's 31 minutes so that's just linked up all the audio super quick we can jump on here it's really nice and responsive and if we were to just go through and once again we just do some cuts and some ripples and some really simple stuff that's too much we want some more of that and there you go now if we grab that obs stuff change the position and we've pasted that along our timeline so we've got still got our main 4k we've also got some obs 4k running picture in picture so it's having to read and display both of those and once again real time 30 frames and it'll play back with no issues just out of interest I did another couple of layers of that obs we've actually got three of those obs and the main and it's still not skipping a beat whatsoever now there's not too much in this but it was just a general vlog I didn't have to color grade it because I shot everything with a lutz built in but we've got some simple titles some punch in some overlays some music in the background some nice simple cuts this is all 4k once again and as expected it's all running really really well the audio has a dialogue leveler on there just to balance everything out so it's doing a little bit of AI stuff for us and the whole timeline is really nice and smooth we can jump into the cut page that's nice edit page color page everything's just really responsive and good to go even this 6k anamorphic here what we can do is highlight everything we can go to the clip attributes and we can de-squeeze this now this was all shot Panasonic V-Log so we just need to change the color space we could change this to be Panasonic and now it all looks better and normalized drop that on this anamorphic timeline nice buttery smooth once again color page we can start doing some color grading put my no tree on there start messing around with it and job done now rendering and exporting is pretty pokey as well it's pretty quick it's not mind-bendingly quick it's not going to compete with a big power hungry nvidia gpu or anything like that but it's actually quite impressive so this 10-bit 422 4k project again let's do quick time h.265 ultra hd 25 frames optimized for speed main 10 all of that good stuff we will render this out and see what we get and straight away you can see that we're rendering this at about a hundred ish frames per second four times real time on a 600 quid mac mini which at the moment i can't hear and it's not warm to the touch using a free version of DaVinci Resolve that's not bad at all and by the way that entire eight-minute project took just two minutes and 12 seconds which is not too shabby for another quick example here is some ultra hd once again so 4k this is all 25 frames 10 bits from an osmo pocket which is usually quite compressed so it can be quite difficult to edit once again it's all nice and quick there's no issues whatsoever with any of this on the color page i've got a nice simple node tree we can kind of just mess around and do color grading which again even at 4k is not having any real issues whatsoever a bit of balance maybe a little bit of contrast saturation temperature let's warm this up you get the idea you can go through and do some nice simple color grading with no issue we've also put a LUT on there just to see how that's looking so there we go we can copy all of that over to all the other clips again all nice and responsive jump back to the edit page super quick once again and then if we deliver this one again ultra hd 25 optimized for speed even with the color grade on this is running pretty much the same speed so all of this is 25 frames and it's all running out at 100 fps so again it's going to be about four times real speed then just kind of for fun and out of curiosity i turned all of those clips into a multicam to see if that multicam would run smoothly as well it dropped a couple of frames but generally it was not bad so that's seven angles of 4k and as you can see we can just swap the angles on the timeline without too many issues at all and if that's what you're doing if you're just kind of cutting things up maybe do vlogs or youtube videos or i don't know gopro stuff osmo pocket things and you're just looking to cut things up have it really nice and smooth and not be waiting ages to do any renders i can't really knock it i don't really have anything negative to say about it from that point of view it's really quick it's really efficient it's really quiet and it just kind of does the job and even if you start pushing it to do some slightly more complicated things it still doesn't do too bad so we're back on my vlog kind of timeline and this is all ultra hd once again if we just pick an edit point we'll go to the video transitions any of these kind of standard ones like push for example is absolutely fine you're not going to have any issues with those if we come down to like a spiral wipe once again it's all going to play at real time the only ones you will have some issues with are these fusion ones block glitch does start to drop a few frames but again this is a 4k brightness flash that one's pretty good disarrange this is one of the trickiest ones generally and that is really starting to slow down a little bit but it's not too bad you could speed that up by changing the playback to half which honestly is still going to look fine and it's just going to give it a bit more speed so we're still dropping some frames but it's not bad at all so let's go grab some fusion effects binoculars that one's absolutely fine cctv dropping a few frames but not too bad digital glitch that one's a more difficult one and that one is starting to run into some issues we're only getting a couple of frames per second again you could speed that up by dropping the playback resolution down if you wanted to let's just try paper edge is one last one you can't really see that until you make it a bit smaller and that's absolutely fine as well so the last one to try titles clean and simple is clean and simple no drop frames the digital glitch which again is usually one of the heavier ones is going to start to drop some frames there elegant shadow once again dropping some frames but if we go playback let's go half see if this one works yep that can now play that while maintaining 25 frames and let's just do jitter that one's no issues as well and let's just do one more we just have a real quick look at these stinger transitions we've got blobs real time we've got circles that's all real time and generic label real time as well and then lastly just to show you all of this together here's one of my main timelines I did recently there's loads going on here we've got push-ins we've got adjustment clips we've got layers with images kind of popping in and titles and arrows and all sorts of stuff and this is all 4k and it's still not too bad it's not quite as smooth obviously because there's a few more bits going on and if we hit play like at the beginning where we've got my magic zoom effect going on that's dropping a few frames we've got some more titles going on as you can see over here so there are things that are slowing it down but overall it's pretty workable and it's not too bad we've got my magic zoom tool going over here which actually works really really well that's nice and smooth so we can put that wherever we like and it's doing the job quite nicely so let's just see how long this takes to render and that was completed in just under 13 minutes hey it's editor Alex here I've literally just finished putting this very video together in I was in the free version I've just upgraded it to the studio version so I can do the captions and overall it's been running really good it's done a really nice job it's been nice and smooth I did end up lowering the proxy to half mainly because some of the titles some of the effects I was using were slowing things down slightly but when that proxy was set to half it was really nice smooth and easy to put this project together now make sure to check the pinned comment where I'll let you know how long this took to render so as you can see it's really quite quick and I'm really quite impressed with this little Mac mini if you're doing any sort of 1080p you won't have pretty much any issues you'll blaze through everything drop titles do multi cams drop effects and transitions and all that sort of stuff on there when you're doing ultra HD or 4k you do need to be slightly more mindful of what you're doing if you're using titles and stuff but it's still pretty quick if you're just cutting stuff together and then doing some simple color grading and then exporting the videos there's not much to say it's really impressive now I am going to switch to this all my future videos for the next couple of weeks are going to be done on this entry-level base model cheapest possible mac mini so I'll keep you posted with my thoughts and feelings I hope this video was useful if you've been looking at picking one up let me know down in the comments section below thanks for watching take it easy I'll see you next time
