What up, folks? Alex here. Hope you're doing well. In this video, I'm going to crack open fusion and I'm going to show you how I made those Transitions which I released to you back in December. Now, it's a much longer video than usual. This is more of a 20-minute Tuesday rather than a five-minute Friday. So go put the kettle on or crack yourself open the beer because this one is a little bit longer than usual. But trust me, it's worthwhile because I'm going to go through all the steps to show you how to make a simple whip pan Transition and once you've got the whip pan nailed the rest come pretty easily after that Also, if you did download that transitions pack and you want to say thank you for it There's a link down below for my buying me a coffee. You can send me a few quid for the effort Now this is also super useful because I'm going to be releasing another Transition pack very soon and if you want to make some of those yourself You need to know everything in this video to be able to do the next step to make the next transitions without all that the way Let's open the venture resolve hop into fusion and take a look shall we? So here we are in DaVinci resolve now the first thing you want to do before you do anything It's just make sure to set your timeline frame rate correctly This should be set to the frame rate that you use or edit in most often so for me That's 24 frames per second now That's because when you create these transitions that we created at that frame rate and it's not easy to change it So make sure you get this correct The first thing we need to do is to add an adjustment clip onto our timeline so open up your media pool Click on effects Adjustment clips and just add that onto your timeline Now we need to make this to be the right length of the transition I find a second works well, but you can play with it as much as you like So the easiest way to actually make this a second I find Tray it to the far left Move your play head to the one second mark which is right there for me And I can just resize that and I know that that is exactly one second in length Now there's a bug in DaVinci resolve so there's additional step just grab that adjustment clip Drag it into your media pool Delete it off your timeline just using backspace And then add that back onto your timeline once that bug is fixed I will cut this part of the video out now once you've got your adjustment clip set to the right length Just drag it and you want to put it over the point where your two clips meet so where you want this transition to be Even though we're only setting these up for now It's still worth having these two clips on your timeline because then you can see how it all looks So perfect like that once it's done give it a click and then head into the fusion tab Now if you've never seen the fusion before or if never spent too much time in here It can look a bit confusing, but it's honestly not that bad We're not actually going to talk about it too much I'm not going to explain too many things because I want this purely to be a tutorial on creating these transitions But I'll do a separate video on fusion itself So the first thing we need to do is just to make sure that you're seeing the same as I am We're just going to make sure we've all got the same amount of things open So click on effects library in the top left here. So you've got that open Click on clips. So you've got the clips down the bottom open click on nodes so you can see your nodes here And then from the right hand side make sure everything's off with the exception of the inspector Now the first thing you want to do is just make sure that your adjustment clip is selected Like so and then you can just actually close the clips down now underneath you preview here You've got this little timeline of frames because I'm working get 24 frames per second. You can see I've got 24 It looks like I've only got 23, but that's actually because zero is counted as a frame So zero to 23 is 24 frames Under there, we've got our little controls here So we can play and then we've got our nodes now nodes are what we're going to be working with most and again Looks really confusing. Honestly, not that bad. Just think of it like a train. You've got the start Station here the station you begin with your media in and then you've got your destination or your end station This is the media out This is your little train line and you just add Stations along the way so we can add effects that get picked up from start To finish I don't know if that's usual. That's how I think of it and it really helps me understand it So there you go So we're doing a whip pan so we need to use a transform node to get going So open up the effects library should already have that open click on tools Transform and then click and hold your mouse on transform and drag it to this line until it changes color And then release like so if you miss and then it with a transform node That's not connected to anything like so just give it a click hold shift and then you can drop it onto that line You don't need one. So we'll just get rid of that Now give the transform node a click and you were heading over to the inspector here Now the inspector is very similar to what you're used to seeing within the edit tab So we've got all these different attributes which we can change So we've got the center here and we've got the x which is the x axis and I can just drag that left and right To move the clip left and right Nice and simple The problem is if we move that to the left you end up with this empty space here now in fusion You can solve that really quickly where you can see edges here. It says canvas just change canvas to mirror And what it would do is it'll fill that empty space with a mirrored image of the clip itself Which makes doing our whip transitions really really easy So I'm just going to reset that I can double click on center to reset it all to default And we're going to use keyframes to animate this so it gets whipped into the left-hand side So to do that, we just need to select the right frames along here and then set some keyframes So we're going to drag this little red marker here so the far left or you can just type zero in this box here I generally just use this because I find it a little bit easier zero in The inspector click on this little diamond next to center to set a keyframe and at this point We're not going to change any settings at all. We're just telling resolve that at this point in time Ie this frame we want it to be these settings Then we're going to go to the middle frame Obviously half of 24 is 12 if you're using 30 frames, that's 15 if you're using 60, that's 30 So for me, it's 12 so give that a click and then we need to change this setting So what we want at this point is for a clip to be completely out the way So I'm just going to click and hold my mouse in here and I can drag to the left We just want it to be completely out the way which I can tell you is Minus 0.5 Because it was on 0.5. We're doing a minus one and we'll result in minus 0.5 Then we're going to move a playhead along until 23, which is the last frame And we're going to do same thing again. This one is at minus 0.5 at the moment We want to minus one from that which means we were at minus 1.5 Like so and now if we hit play You can see it's just moving it to the left And it's sort of a real basic with pan transition, but obviously at the moment it looks kind of horrible That's because it's completely linear. So we need to change that up. So let's just stop that In the top right hand corner here, you can click on spline So open this box up. So this is where we can actually Curve or smooth out those keyframes to make the animation look a lot nicer So you can see all the different nodes which we've added here. We've only added one so it's transformed So give that a click and this little graph will appear You can zoom in and out if you need to or scroll up and down and you can see our three keyframes So we've got our start down the bottom here and middle one and our end one Now at the moment as you can see it's a really sharp little corner It's completely linear. So we need to smooth that out So give the top one a click and then down in the bottom left You should see this little smooth icon. Give that a click Do the same for the middle and the same for the bottom Now you're free to experiment with this as much as you like but I've got a little process It's works for me 99% of the time so I usually stick to that give the middle one a click now that it's smooth And you've got this little bar with the two dots grab the top one and just drag it to the left until it's completely Vertical so we've got this little line now is completely vertical Go to the top one. You've got the same little line with a little dot Keep it a horizontal line and just drag it so it's roughly above the middle one like so And then repeat for the bottom one click drag that out and it'll give you a real nice s curve So now if we hit play The animation starts off really slow whoops really fast in the middle and then slows down again So that looks much much nicer The only thing is missing is a motion blur So with the effects library still open scroll down so you've got open effects Expand that go to resolve FX blur and Then from here we want the directional blur click drag and drop it down here on your little train line after transform And we've added a directional blur node Give it a click head over to the inspector Now there's a few things we need to change. We actually work from the middle makes life a little bit easier You've got that angle so I'm just gonna show you this. We'll put the blur all the way up You can see it's running at a 45 degree angle. We're whipping from left to right. That's not what we want So we just need to adjust the angle accordingly. You can either go to 180 or Zero look the same Now you'll also notice the edges. We've got this blank showing So just change that go to border type from black change that to reflect and that'll get rid of that. So perfect We're just going to reset our blur strength I can give that a double click and now we essentially just need to repeat the same process We did for the transform but this time with the blur so we're going to come down to our zero frame We're going to add a keyframe It's set to naught point two at the moment. I actually want zero blur at the beginning of this animation So we're going to drag that to zero We're going to find our middle frame so 12 and at this point. I want it to be quite high I'm going to go with about point seven ish perfect We're going to drag to 23 the last one and we're going to bring that right down to zero So now we've got three keyframes you can actually scroll through the keyframes using this little marker here next to the keyframe So obviously we're at the very end at the moment. We've just got left. So I'll give the click we're at zero naught point six five in the middle and Not again the very beginning If we hit play on this That's starting to look much much better, but again, we can smoothen out slightly just by using the spline tool So this purple line or pink line here. This is our transform We can just give that a click to get rid of it and then we're just looking at add directional blur keyframes We're just going to repeat the same process as before give it on a click smooth that out Smooth that one out and we'll smooth this one out too I'm not going to adjust them because that actually works quite well. Then if we play That's looking pretty good to me and it's as easy as that to make this real simple whip pan transition You've head back into the edit tab If we just hit play we can see what it looks like properly and that looks really nice So now we can give the adjustment clip a click Open up the inspector within the edit tab where you've got name and I'm just going to call this whip left Drag that into my media pool or a power bin and it's there ready to go Now that obviously which the left maybe one have a whip to the right as well Fortunately, you've done all the hard work. So we've got the whip pan Set up in our media pool. So that's done. We can forget about that. We've got this one on a timeline So give it a click head back into fusion Click on clips make sure that you select the adjustment clip And then we can close that down if we want to Click on the transform node We've still got all of our key frames so we can go first one second one third one And all we need to do is repeat the process so everything goes to the right rather than the left So rather than minusing one every time you want a plus one. So we go from naught point five to one point five To two point five Now often it's worth just checking your spline your curves Because in my example as you can see it's gone completely haywire Which will look very strange. So what you need to do click the middle one Set it back to linear click the top one Set it back to linear and then just do what we did originally. So the bottom one's fine Click the middle one We'll just straighten that out Click the top one Ain't that smooth again and drag that into the middle That looks better and now I have a whip to the right head back into the edit tab We'll rename this one whip Right Drag that into our media pool job done. We've got whip left. We've got a whip right And pretty much all of the transitions I made in my whip or camera movement transitions pack Essentially this method exactly the same just a different variants of it. So let's give this one a click I head back into fusion We've got our transform obviously we're using the x-axis if we did the exact same thing with the y-axis Which I'm going to show you really quickly. I'm not going to talk you through it too much I'll just do it nice and fast so you can see how it looks I Curve these out Exactly as we did before obviously just much much faster And we've effect we've used the y-axis rather than the x and now it'll whip up Now it looks weird because the blur is wrong So if we just go to the directional blur and change the angle to 90 degrees, which should be straight up or straight down There you go now we've got an up we can go back to edit whip Up Smash that over there done do the opposite. So again, let's go fusion clips adjustment clip Transform this time rather than y 0.5 to 1.5 to 2.5 would go back down So 0.5 to minus 0.5 to minus 1.5 now gets a whip down if you do them both at the same time so we've got 1.5 or 1.5 and then 2.5 and 2.5 it will go in a diagonal So if we hit play on this It goes up to the top right so you can see how this is going you can build all of the those transitions Just using different numbers on this center here to move it left right up down Top angles and that sort of thing Now to do rotational ones so spins again, it's exactly the same thing But rather than using this center, I'll reset that We're gonna do the exact same thing. We're gonna set some keyframes, but we're gonna use the angle instead So again, I'm gonna show you this really quickly. You should hopefully get the gist by now Add a keyframe with zero angle At 12 the middle. We're just gonna set this to be 180 and then at 23 the endpoint we're gonna set this to be 360 Again, let's just smooth that out. So it actually looks decent You Can't talk and multitask when I'm going fast like this there with me Now let's just play on that. We've got a bit of a spin with a nice little animation. So that's looking all right Again, the blur looks wrong because it's directional. So we're just gonna delete the directional blur Gonna go to the exact same place this time. We're gonna grab radial blur Pop that on there radial blur as you can see is rotational We'll change the black to reflect so it gets rid of those edges for us Go to zero We want none at that point. We want quite a bit in the middle And then we want none at the end. So if we hit play again now There's a nice little spin transition for us Another last tip I'm gonna give you in this video if we go to the transform tool You can change the pivot point. So the pivot point is where it rotates from So we're just gonna move this over and then up a bit. Let's go a bit more Now if we let that play it's not gonna rotate in the middle It's gonna rotate from this point. So as you can see it's whipping round from there So again, there's a bunch more There's four different transitions for you because you can do one going from this corner or we'll go down to the bottom left here like so Play that and it's whipping down from the bottom left hand corner Reverse the process so rather than zero one eighty three sixty go zero minus one eighty minus three sixty and then you've got Clockwise rather than anti-clockwise Keep building them keep using the same one starting from that point This one can now be called a spin drop on to your media pool and off you go easy as that And then once you've got these basics down you can start to do more clever stuff, which I'll cover in another video Congratulations all of you that have made it this far really appreciate you sticking around for the whole thing If you enjoyed the video thumbs up if you've got any comments or feedback as always pop them down below I do try and read every comment and I'll respond to as many as I can and If you're new around here, don't forget to subscribe Thank you for watching folks keep your eyes peeled for more videos coming very soon.
