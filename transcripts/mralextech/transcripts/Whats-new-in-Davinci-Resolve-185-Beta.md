What an update. Blackmagic have done it again. They've added the thing that everyone was asking for, auto-generated captions. These captions here generated automatically within DaVinci Resolve Studio and it's all thanks to the latest update, DaVinci Resolve 18.5 which is available to download right now. So what are you waiting for? Go download it. I've linked it down in the description below. It is a pretty big update this one. It's probably one of the biggest since the original DaVinci Resolve 18 came out. It brings a handful of really awesome new headline features, obviously, like the auto-generated captions, but it also brings a bunch of nice quality of life improvements as well. So let's talk about it because I'm excited. Let's jump into it. It was actually only a week or so ago where I made a video talking about all of the things I'd like to see in future versions of DaVinci Resolve and one of them being auto-generated captions. Now, I had absolutely no idea they were in the works, but off the back of that video, Blackmagic actually got in touch and asked if I wanted to check out the beta for this one, which is how I'm able to make this video and get it out to you at launch. So yeah. Now, I'm not going to cover everything. There's just too much in this update to be honest, but what I am going to do is whiz you through the updates, which are most relevant to me and hopefully nice and relevant to you as well. The full release notes and everything is linked down below. So you can go have a read for yourself to see the full list of everything they've included in this one. So with all that out of the way, let's jump into DaVinci Resolve and take a look. And we're going to start off talking with the big ones, the big boys up front, auto-generated captions. Now, these are Studio Only, which I know may upset some people. You do have to be on the paid for Studio version of DaVinci Resolve to get access to these, which we kind of expected to be honest. If you're one of those that commented on my previous video saying if they had auto-generated captions, I'd buy Studio, I guess it's time to go and buy Studio. Because in my testing, honestly, they work really quite well. They're fast, they're reliable, and they even generally managed to understand my Darjeet accent. Now, it's all done on a per timeline basis. So basically, you edit your timeline exactly the same that you usually would, and then right at the end, you generate your captions. So here's a timeline. It's about 10 minutes long. So to generate our captions, we simply click on timeline at the very top. And then we come down to create subtitles from audio. There's a couple of options, and then we simply hit create. And then it'll start analyzing and creating the subtitles. Now, I've got OBS recording at the moment, which is also using my GPU. It's still pretty quick, to be honest, even with OBS running, but it's even faster without. I get about 25 times real speed. So this entire timeline can be done in about 20 seconds or so on my Nvidia RTX 4080, which is plenty fast enough for me. Once it's done, you'll get a simple subtitle track on your timeline like so. And if we hit play, like to see, here's some of the features. You can see, it's already working away. Now, if we give one of them a click in the inspector, we can go to caption, and we can amend each of the captions, we can make our way through all of them. We can change the style of this one particular caption, or we can go to the track and then amend the style, the position, the color, the font of the entire track. So how the subtitles look across the entire timeline. As you can see, it's pretty quick and it's really easy to use and customize and whatever else. Now, at the moment, you can't do any kind of really fancy animations with it. It doesn't look like some of the other more fancy versions out there, but it fundamentally works. And for the first iteration of this, I think it's a really, really great start. And knowing Blackmagic, they'll only keep improving it over time and adding more customization and the ability to do more stuff. So great start. So glad it's there. Captions. Now, next up, they've added something else and it's called auto transcriptions. Now, this is kind of similar to the auto-generated captions, but instead of creating your subtitles, it will essentially just transcribe the entire thing and give you a script, but it's an interactive script. Now, again, for me, this has been pretty quick, pretty reliable. It runs about 30 times real speed for me. And again, it even manages to understand my dodgy accent. So let me show you how this works. So for the transcriptions, all you need to do, find a clip. You can actually do it on a timeline as well if you prefer, but I'm going to go to this Peter McKinnon clip here and I'm going to right click and then there's an option to transcribe audio. Alternatively, there's a brand new handy dandy little icon right here for transcribe audio. You can actually do this for multiple so you can select multiple things and then give it a click. So let's just do it for the one. And after a few moments, this transcription window will appear. So this is the script for this clip, but what we can actually do is just click on the word obviously and it will jump to the word obviously. And then if I hit play, I'm not the captain. And that was obviously I'm not the captain. And it will just run through. Now I want to show you this really quickly. If I jump up to this section here, I say that is Kirk aka Captain Kirk, who is, and then it says burp is Kirk aka Captain Kirk, who is I had a bit of gas did a little burp and it just marked that on there. It will do laughs. It will do clicks, whistles, all that sort of stuff. It's really, really clever. Now once you've got this done, you can click on the little magnifying glass in the top right hand corner to do a search. You can export this entire thing as a text file if you want to. And then you can also use this to build up your timeline. So if I select this section here, let's just do about there like so down in the bottom right hand corner, you've got inserts and append. So if I just insert, it's going to insert that bit that I selected. So if we scroll down, we'll select this paragraph here, and then we'll insert that. And as you can see, you can actually build up the timeline just by highlighting the text within the transcription. Super cool. Neat. Hey. Now next up, there's something called auto audio classification. This will automatically listen to and then filter all of your audio files. Basically. Now this is just easier again if I show you how this works. So within the smart bin, you've now got this collections over here. And we've got video clips and it will automatically filter out videos. And then we've got audio only. So this is all of my MP3s, WAV files and whatever else. We've then got dialogue, music and effects. So if I go to this audio only or highlight everything within here, right click, audio classification, and then we're going to analyze. And then after a few moments, once it's done analyzing, if we go to dialogue, all of my main dialogue audio is in there, music, in music and sound effects, in sound effects, not as much of a game changer as some of the other audio effects, but it's still a pretty cool addition. Now I've been saying audio a lot in there, which is convenient because this video is sponsored by audio. Audio is a highly curated music subscription service that doesn't charge you monthly. You can either buy a lifetime license, or you can get your first year of all of that music and sound effects for just 59 bucks using the code Alex 70 is super easy to download. And it's always accessible from the website. And it covers you for basically anything YouTube videos, commercial video work, podcasts, movies, and even video games. Plus, most importantly, their music selection is awesome. You've got everything from lo-fi beats, rock, hip hop, classical, and everything in between. So why not check them out? There's a link down in the description below. You can use the code Alex 70 to get that massive 70% off and we have your first year for just $59. Cool. Next up, the cut page is getting some serious upgrades. Again, I spoke about this in the previous video. I guess I sort of had a thought they would be doing this and they are the cut page now because of the iPad version. The cut page needs to stand alone on its own two feet. It's not just the page you go to to start cutting and then move on. It needs to be a standalone editing suite, essentially on one page. And that's what they're doing. They're upgrading it, they're changing it, and they're giving it some extra features. So what have we got? Well, for starters, there's subtitles, including those auto generated ones. You couldn't do subtitles at all on the previous cut page. Now you can and you can generate your own. And we've got scene cut detection. Again, this is available only for the studio users. This was a feature which was available in older versions of resolve, but now it's just super accessible directly on the cut page. Scene cut detection will just automatically look through and really long video look for the cuts and then automatically cut that up for you on your timeline. It's really, really clever stuff. So here's the cut page and these two features actually appear on this new menu. So over here to the left of the timeline, we've got these three new buttons. The middle one is timeline actions. We'll give that a click. We've got some extra controls within here like adding video tracks and whatever else. The top two, create subtitles from audio and detect scene cuts. And because they exist on there in that format, we can be pretty sure they will also exist on the iPad version as well. Now something else they've added to the cut page, you can now toggle on and off the ripple function. So the cut page doesn't really allow any gaps. As soon as you cut something, you'll automatically fill in the gaps. You now have the option to turn that on or off, which is interesting because it basically means you can now edit on the cut page in a more traditional manner. Basically, just gives people more options, which is never a bad thing. Now one of the things they've added, which I think is essential and I'm so glad they finally added it, you can now do split edit, aka J and L cuts on the cut page, which you couldn't do before. Over on the left, we have this other new icon, which is our enlarged track. We'll give that a click and it makes it a little bit easier to see what we're doing. If we click on this edit point, we can then just roll it forwards and back as we usually would. But now we also have the option if we hover our mouse over the audio section down here. And now we can move this edit point forwards or back, allowing us to do J and L cuts. Such a simple thing, but it needed to be added. So I'm really glad they've added that onto there. Now there are a few other bits and bobs, but I've just linked them down below. We'll move on from the cut page and talk about the edit page, which I know most of you are more interested in than the cut page. And other than the things I mentioned at the beginning, there's nothing too spectacular here. They haven't changed things up or added any super cool new features, but they have added some nice, useful quality of life improvements as well. Now the first one, which is a new feature, actually, but it's certain support for fast per timeline backups. You can set the duration of how often these backups occur. And then to access them, you simply find your timeline within the media pool, right click, and then you've got restore timeline backups. And you can see all of the times that this has been backed up. And then if I want to restore one, let's go with this one here. We give it a click and it's going to restore this main timeline backup. So we've still got the main timeline, the one we were just on. But now we have the old backup as well. Useful. Never going to complain about more backups. They've also added the ability to add and delete keyframes with keyboard shortcuts. And they've added the ability to amend keyframes even while previewing. So previously, to amend keyframes, you'd have to pause your playback, amend the keyframe, and then go back and play again. Now you can amend the keyframes while you're playing. Sounds like a small thing, but again, it just makes life a little bit easier. They've added the ability to export stills from both the edit and cut pages. Another quite handy one. You're creating a thumbnail, you want to grab a quick still from your project. You can now do it. All you need to do, click file at the very top, then go to export, current frame as still. Then you've got the option to export as a JPEG, a PNG, a TIFF, loads of options within there. Oh, this is a good one. RETIME CURVE now invokes this speed curve by default. Anyone that's ever tried to do any sort of retiming or speed ramping knows this was a strange one. They've now fixed it. Basically, what it means is if we right click on here, and then we go to RETIME CURVE, it will open up RETIME SPEED by default. It used to open up RETIME FRAME, which no one ever used. You'd always have to manually come and swap these over. Now it just defaults to RETIME CURVE. And sticking with small fixes, which got a long way, they've now added the ability to stabilize multiple selected clips from the edit timeline. Hooray! So previously, you used to have to go to each individual clip, open up the inspector, stabilize, wait, and then move on to the next one. Now you can just highlight a bunch of clips and stabilize them all in one big go. And they've improved it even further by now giving you a little pop-up, which tells you which clip it's on and the progress. So you know how long you're going to have to wait. Small steps, but really does go a long way to make life a little bit easier. Now they've also added a handful of new effects templates and transitions onto the edit page and the cut page. Now there's nothing too fancy in here, but it's nice to have. So within the effects area, we've now got a graphics cross overlay, a highlight stretch, a noise distortion, paper edge repeat, shape, slice, stretch, a couple of new ones there. And then we've also got, oh that's a good look, and then within video transitions and fusion transitions, we've got a block glitch, a circle spin, a detailed dissolve, that was already there, edgy, fold, logo wipe, luma wipe, mosaic, you get it. There's some new stuff. Quick export is now available on both the edit and color pages. Again, it just says you a few extra clicks. You don't need to always go over to the deliver page. You just click a button and off you go. They've also changed how vertical timelines work. Now when you create a vertical timeline, it will automatically default to full frame with crop, which basically just means if you create a vertical timeline, whenever you drop something on it, it'll automatically be zoomed in to fill the frame. And last but not least about the edit page, this is another studio only feature, but they've improved super scaling and they've made it more accessible. So if you've never heard of super scaling, it allows you to basically artificially boost up the resolution of footage. So if you've got some 1080p footage, you want to throw it on a 4k timeline, you can apply super scaling just to make it look a little bit better. Now it used to be in a weird spot. It was in clip properties, but now it's available from the inspector. So within the inspector, right at the bottom, you've got super scaling, there's a new 2x enhanced version, and you've got more control over the sharpening and the noise reduction. Now there's a whole bunch of updates regarding the color page, which I'm going to gloss over because I don't really do the color page as well as some other people do. So I'll leave it up to the colorists. But what I will mention, the big main one I believe is they now have the ability to do per timeline color management. So if you use the color management within the DaVinci Resolve, that used to be set to per project, now you can do that per timeline. So let's skip ahead to Fusion. They've had its support for USD based workflows within Fusion. So this is not something I'm too familiar with, but it says the Universal Scene Descriptor, USD framework, is a set of open standards for interacting, describing, saving, and interpreting 3D scene info in a single common format. Okay, cool. Stuff for me, but you know, hopefully that's really useful for others, I'm sure it is. That's where they've added it. But there you go. They've also added something called a new multi merge tool to composite and manage multiple layers. This is cool. So if you've ever used the merge tool, you know that you can only merge basically two things into it. There's now a multi merge so you can merge as many things as you like. Rather than having to merge two things into a merge and then merge that merge into another merge, which has got two things in it, you can just do it all in one, should make life a little bit easier. And lastly, they've added an AI based resolve FX relight tool to add virtual lighting within studio. Now this one is a studio only feature because it uses DaVinci Resolve's neural engine, the AI stuff. Now I haven't played with this extensively, so I don't really know how it works. But I jumped on to have a real quick look and it looks cool. So you can really quickly create like a map as you're seeing on screen now. And then when you move the lights around, it will just cast shadows in the right directions. There's also some additional controls so you can change the light source, you can change the intensity, the specularity controls, there's all sorts of stuff that you can have a play with in there. So there you go. Now to wrap up because this video has gone on for too long, I've got a couple of other honorable mentions. Number one, I can feel you grimace already. You can now upload directly to TikTok from within DaVinci Resolve. Now I know it's TikTok, but TikTok is big business. A lot of brands, a lot of businesses use TikTok, they're using vertical video. So to be able to upload directly from DaVinci Resolve, again, just saves people that additional step. So why not? You can choose to ignore it, but it's there if you want it. And something else you can choose to ignore, but is there if you want it? You can now render GIFs from DaVinci Resolve, which I think is great because I love a good GIF. So it's now an option as I format within the deliver page. So you can create your own GIFs in DaVinci Resolve and render them out. You can also render out JPEGs and PNGs. And last but not least, there's the usual system improvements and stability improvements too. One thing they have mentioned is there is now apparently smoother video updates when the system cannot play in real time. So previously, it just really stuttered if your machine was a little bit slower. They've apparently improved that, so it's a little bit more manageable. You can still work with it even if your system is a little bit slow. And there you go. That's all the main stuff that's in DaVinci Resolve 18.5. I hope you enjoyed this video. Hopefully it wasn't too waffly for you. Let me know what you think down below. Thanks for watching. Take it easy. I'll see you next time.
