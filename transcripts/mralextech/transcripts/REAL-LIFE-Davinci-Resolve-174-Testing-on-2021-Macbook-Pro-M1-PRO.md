What up, folks? Alex here, Mr. Alex Tech, and here it is. Here is my MacBook Pro. This is the M1 Pro model. So it's the MacBook Pro with the Pro processor. It's the 10-core CPU, 16-core GPU, one a terabyte of unified memory, 14-inch model that cost me a grand total of £2,399. So it's not cheap. This is a bloody expensive laptop, and this is actually one of the lowest ones you can buy. This isn't the entry-level one. The entry-level one is one below. This is the next up from that. Now, I've only had this for literally a day or so. I've not had very long with it at all, but I've been tinkering with it, messing with it, running some benchmarks, and I figured I'd just hop on, give you a really informal sort of look at the overall performance in real time as best I can so you can see what the performance is like. A few times I compare to my PC because that's what I've been using for a long time. My desktop PC is a Ryzen 5 3600. It's got 32 gigabytes of DDR4 RAM, and it's running an RTX 2060. They're very, very similar in terms of performance, like surprisingly similar. But anyway, let's open up DaVinci Resolve, because that's probably why you're here. You want to see some DaVinci Resolve goodness, and I'm just going to show you some little things which I think are important. So I'm capturing this using a capture card rather than my usual screen recording software, because I didn't want the screen recorder to be using CPU, using resources, and actually limit the power of the laptop and give a sort of a false reading. So we're exporting the video via HDMI to a capture card, which is capturing in 1080p, which is why it looks slightly different than usual. Right, with all that out the way, let's open up DaVinci Resolve and I'll show you what's what. So here we are on the desktop of the MacBook Pro, and the first thing we're going to do have a look at how quick DaVinci Resolve opens. So you can see we don't have anything else open. DaVinci Resolve is currently closed. We're going to give it a click. It's going to open up, get to our project manager pretty quickly, and then we're going to open up this project, double click, and we're in. Now that's one of the first things you notice, opening anything up is particularly quick, but getting into DaVinci Resolve is rapid. DaVinci Resolve opens really quick and then getting into projects is equally as quick as well. Something that my Windows PC just can't do as well. Admittedly, it does have a much bigger database, there's loads of projects in there, but I actually opened a fresh database and it's still not quite as quick. So for a laptop for me specifically, that's super useful because I have a laptop so that if I have half an hour somewhere, I can boot it open, do some work, close it, and off I go, and being able to get into DaVinci Resolve so quick is a big thumbs up from me. So here we are. We're on the edit page as you'd expect, and I've got this project set up so I can give you a few little demonstrations. This is called Timeline 2. I'm just going to hop into Timeline 2, Timeline Settings, and as you can see, this is a 4K Timeline 25 frames per second. I'm just going to come up here, go to Playback. I'm going to show you that the optimized media and the proxy media are turned off. Timeline Proxy is off, and what we're going to do is delete render cache so there's no cache in the background. Now, one thing I will show you, see my mouse up there? Yeah, I can't see that. I can't see that mouse. Some of the notch you can in the screen capture, I can't. Thanks, notch. I hate the notch, but anyway. So what we're going to do, we've got this footage here. Number 10, I'm going to drop this on my timeline like so. Give it a click. We'll open the inspector, just go to File. Now, this is a 4K. It's actually a Cinema 4K, so it's slightly bigger than usual 4K. Black Magic Raw 25 frames per second. So we can close this down and we can just click through like so. And as you can see, it's super snappy. We'll hit play. It's having no time at all playing any of that. Let's get rid of that bit. We'll do a cut here, get rid of that bit. And as you can see, in terms of real time playback, there's no issues there whatsoever. Now, that file is sitting internally on the internal hard drive, but I have tested it with a external SSD via USB Type-C, and it is equally as rapid. Now, again, the second thing you'll notice after the boot speed is how quick it feels. It feels really snappy and responsive within Resolve itself. Now, I think that's probably because of the 17.4 update that released a little while ago. You get a faster refresh rate in the software itself. So I think it's up to 120 frames per second when just moving around the UI, which does make it feel really, really snappy. And then the fact that it's reading the files so quick, there's no stutter whatsoever. You can just play everything back at 25 frames per second. So again, 4K, 4K, no issues there. Let's just try the same thing with a 6K file. So I'm going to leave those on the timeline. And then we just can hop into the Multi-Cam, grab this one, put it down on the timeline. And again, no issues whatsoever. We can just hop between the two. I will show you in the Inspector file, 5888 by 3312. So that's a 6K. Hit play. Tiny stutter initially, but no issues there. We can hop between the two. It's happy as Larry. Right, let's do some basic grades. So I'm going to hop into the color page. And I'm going to open up my usual grades in this gallery. I'm going to drop these on here like so. Now, these grades aren't anything too exciting, but this is what I use for all of my videos. We've got a LUT in the first node here. Then we've got some basic color wheel adjustments, that sort of thing. Nothing fancy going on, but we've just got some log adjustments and stuff like that. And then the final one, we've got a couple of other sort of contrast adjustments. And then we've got a little bit of sharpening going on as well. So we're just going to apply that to all of these. And then we can just whip around again on the timeline. We're getting 25 frames per second, 25. Let's go back to the edit page. Hit play. 25 over there. 25. Me picking my nose. Good shot. 25. It wasn't it. I promise. 25. Yeah. And then the 6K. No issues there at all. So no issues there whatsoever, playing back 4K and 6K Black Magic Role on a 4K timeline. Remember, this is all on battery as well. This is not being plugged in. This is all being done on the battery, which is really quite impressive. Let's keep going and see what else we can do. The first thing I'm going to show you is multicam. So over here, I've got this multicam. I'm going to drop this in here so we have a quick look at it. This has got eight layers. So there's six layers of 4K on here and then two layers of 6K. And each of the different clips has been graded with the exact same grade that I showed you. So a LUT, color wheel, some slightly more color wheel and sharpening. And you can see all eight are down here. So then what we're going to do, hop onto my timeline two, grab this multicam, drop this on my timeline, and then just hit play initially. So this is obviously just the first clip that we're seeing, but that's playing no issues whatsoever. Let's open up the multicam viewer so we can see all of the different angles within here and we'll hit play. A little bit of stuttering as it catches up with itself, but after a second or two, we get full real time 25 frames per second. It does seem to drop a frame here and there, but overall, that's pretty solid. Remember, that's six loads of 4K, two loads of 6K all graded. Now let's actually try and snap through and make some cuts. So we'll cut to this one here, cut to this one up here. We'll cut around and as you can see, it's doing a pretty good job. Dropped a couple of frames there, start to stutter, we'll cut again. And there we go. Let's just turn off the multicam viewer, get rid of this, go back to the beginning, we'll play this a little bit faster, playing through 25 frames per second on the timeline, no issues again whatsoever. Now staying on the timeline, I'm going to get this footage down next. Now this is slightly different. This is 4K, H.265, 50 frames per second. So we can hit play and this will play back exactly the same, no drop frames, no issues. We're going to hop into the color page, we're going to apply my grade, again 25, no problems at all. Looking pretty good. Then what we're going to do, right click, change clip speed, we're going to pop this to 50%. So it's playing back, this will be 50% slow mode because it is 50 frames per second. And again, no issues whatsoever with playing that back. Now let's do something a little bit crazy, make this a nice small window, pop it up in the corner like so, put it over the multicam and we'll see, hit play and we're still getting full 25 frames per second playback. And again, just to be sure, playback, render cache, delete, everything, yep, back to the beginning, hit play. And it's having no issues whatsoever. Let's do a cut on this and a cut there, we'll ripple delete that. Didn't even skip a beat when it was doing that cut. So in terms of dropping files on editing 4K, 6K, B-Raw or H.265, it has no issues whatsoever. It's really very impressive. So that's a full 4K timeline, no render cache, no optimized media, we haven't created anything, that's just the files straight from the internal hard drive running on battery and it's having no issues whatsoever. It's very, very impressive. Now let's just say that's pretty much all you do, maybe you're a vlogger, that sort of thing, you drop your footage into DaVinci Resolve, whether it's 1080p or 4K, you work on a 1080p or 4K timeline, you do some color grays, you chop things up, you don't really do much motion graphics, much fusion, anything like that, you render it out and off you go. This will do pretty much anything that you want it to do. It will handle anything you can throw at it without really dropping your frame. As mentioned, I've just used eight layers of raw and it was no problem at all, then I started stacking on some H.265, 50 frames per second, all graded and it was doing absolutely fine. So if that's what you do, this would be more than enough. But what if you do a bit more than that? Let's apply some titles, see how it handles the fusion and then we're going to hop into the color page and mess with some noise reduction and the face refinement tools to see how it handles that side of things. So we're still within our timeline too, we've got two pieces of 4K raw on this 4K timeline, everything's been graded. And the first thing I'm going to have a look at some simple transitions. Now everything we're going to use is from Motion VFX, you can check those out by clicking on the link down in the description below. So I'm going to grab this corner spin transition or pop this on here and we'll just see if it can play this in real time. Which it cannot, doesn't do too badly, but it does start to stutter. So let's open this in fusion, we'll see what the actual FPS is, hit play, down here 13, 14, just dip off, it goes to about four or five. It's quite varied, it's probably good to the motion blur. But honestly, that's not too bad for a full 4K timeline. Let's just go up here and we'll enable our render cache, put it to smart. Hit play the once stutters a little bit, we'll come back play again, and it's all rendered. So that was really really quick, didn't take long to actually render that once the render cache was enabled. Now we're just going to turn that render cache off just for another quick demo. This time we're going to go to titles. Once again, motion VFX, we'll go to the intro one and let's just grab this one here and pop this on the timeline. Again, nothing's been pre rendered for 4K if we hit play. It's not doing too bad, but it's definitely stuttering not giving us a full 25 frames per second. Again, we'll open in fusion, we'll hit play. And we're getting seven and a half, somewhere between all dropped a little bit now. So between six and a half and seven and a half frames per second playing this back again, full 4K all being generated on the fly, which again is honestly not that bad for a laptop running on battery. So I can't really complain about that. Let's go up to the playback render cache will enable that. We'll see how long this takes. We'll give you a quick play through. There's one full play. I'll try it again. Not quite there, but it is rendering pretty quick. We're about halfway through now. We'll give it another second or two. And it's pretty much done. So there we go. So it's actually quite impressive when it's doing any sort of fusion. I've compared this against my PC once again, and this is actually faster. When we're doing pure fusion, which is a little bit of CPU and GPU based stuff, it is quicker by usually a couple of frames per second than my actual PC. So good going MacBook on that one. Let's have a look now at noise reduction and the face refinement. Once again, I'm going to delete my render cache. So now I can complain about that. We don't need this one. We'll just use this footage here. We can hop into the color page. So this has already got all of our original grade applied. And again, we can play this back 25 frames per second, no problem at all. So I'm going to add a serial node very beginning, and we're going to come down to our noise reduction. Now remember 4k footage, 4k timeline, I'm going to do one frame, I'm going to leave it as faster, medium, and I'm going to guesstimate this will do about 20 of everything.霓k. Just at the speed and we'll hit play. And we get full ish. It's actually red. So it is dropping a frame it's very nearly 25, but it's just dropping the odd frame here or there. It says 25 frames per second. Pretty much so it's pretty close. It's almost there. There we go down to 23 it's dropping the odd frame, but honestly, that's doing a pretty good job. Let's bump that up to the two frames. And we do see a drop then we're down to 1920 ish frames per second. We'll go down to three. And as you guess, we've dropped a few more 17 frames per second. Now let's just jump all the way down to five. We're down to 13 frames per second. Obviously, if we add any spatial noise reduction as well, that's going to continue going down even further and we're going to struggle to get five frames per second, four or five frames per second there. Now again, that's a 4K timeline. Personally, I almost never edit in a 4K timeline. I always edit in the 1080p timeline and I just bump up the resolution at the end before I export. So let's just change this to a 1080p timeline instead and see how it performs with that. So timeline settings will knock this down to 1080p or of course instead you could use the timeline proxy mode, but I've just knocked it down to 1080p. We'll hop into the color page. I'm just going to reset the spatial and we're going to go to one frame hit play. And at one frame, we've got our green dot and we're getting full 25 frames per second. We're going to skip to go straight to three hit play. Once again, green dot 25 frames per second. No issues there whatsoever. And we'll come on down to number five hit play. Green dot 25 frames per second. Again, just so no one can complain, delete render cache or yep. Go back to the beginning hit play. Green dot 25 frames per second. So it's having no issues at all with 4K footage on a 1080p timeline. It's just 4K footage on a 4K timeline. It does start to skip frames. Let's add some spatial noise reduction as well. Just to finish this off, we're using five frames still hit play. We are dropping frames with that as well. We're now sitting at 1617 ish frames per second. If we're not the frames down to let's just go with two. We've recovered a little bit 1920 frames per second about that with the temporal noise reduction and the spatial noise reduction. Now noise reduction, regardless is known as a bit of a killer in DaVinci Resolve. The fact that it's doing that at all really with 4K footage on a 4K timeline is pretty impressive. If you knock that down to 1080p, you can edit comfortably at full frames per second as long as you don't have the spatial noise reduction on there as well. So whether that's good enough for you is what you're cool. If you do do a lot of noise reduction, maybe spending the additional even more money going for the max might be beneficial to you. Now to finish off, I'm just going to show you the face refinement tool because that's using the DaVinci Resolve neural engine, that little AI engine. So I think that would be a good test just to see how well that does. So there you go. Let's have a look. So we're going to bump this up back to a 4K timeline. We've got a 20, 18 second clip of me just talking to the camera. So then we're going to hop into the color page. We're going to leave these as they are or add an additional node. We'll go to effects, face refinement tool, pop that on there and then we're just going to get analyze and straight away without giving it time to think. Doing a pretty good job. It's picked up my face. It's picked up my jawline here, my lips, my nose, my eyes and my eyebrows and it's processing that relatively quickly. And there you go. It didn't take very long to do that. We'll turn off the overlay. Let's make myself look beautiful. We'll add some brightening to my eyes. Give myself a bit of a blush. You see it's all happening real time. No issues there. Give myself some nice lips as well. Why not? And then if we come back to the beginning, hit play. It is dropping. Oh no, it's picked up. It's stuffed it at the beginning, but now it's playing at the full 25 frames per second with my beautiful lips and my beautiful pink cheeks all applied. No problems whatsoever. So there you go. That's a quick tour of DaVinci Resolve on the new MacBook M1 Pro mid-level sort of laptop and it's really impressive. It is impressive. It's not perfect. It does obviously have its limitations, but for a 14 inch laptop, it's done really, really well. It's not hot after all that benchmarking. The fans haven't come on. I've been recording this video on and off for 30 or 40 minutes and there's no fans whatsoever. After all this time, we've lost 15 ish percent battery life. So not much at all. So overall it is very, very impressive. I've got some more videos lined up where I'm going to directly compare this against an M1 Air from last year and another where I'm going to compare it directly against my own PC in lots of fun little benchmarks. If there's anything else you'd like to see, please do let me know down in the comment section below. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. See ya.
